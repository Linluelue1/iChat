I got a copy of your drawings.\nCome in and tell me about it.\nWhat sort of competition is it?\nJOHN: Well, It’s an international design competition and we have to come up with a new design for a typical domestic kitchen appliance.\nPROFESSOR: I see, and are there any special conditions?\nDoes it have to save energy for example?\nJOHN: Actually that was the focus in last year’s competition.\nThis year’s different.\nWe have to adopt an\ninnovative\napproach to existing technology (Q21)\n, using it in a way that hasn’t been thought of before.\nPROFESSOR: I see, that sounds tricky.\nAnd what kitchen appliance have you chosen?\nJOHN: Well, I decided to choose the dishwasher.\nPROFESSOR: Interesting, what made you choose that?\nJOHN: Well, they’re an everyday kitchen appliance in most Australian houses but they’re all pretty boring and almost\nidentical\nto each other.\nI think some people will be prepared to pay a little extra for something that looks different (Q22)\n.\nPROFESSOR: That’s a nice idea.\nI see you’ve called your design ‘the Rockpool’; why is that?\nJOHN: Basically because it looks like the rock pools you find on a beach.\nThe top is made of glass so that you can look down into it.\nPROFESSOR: And there’s a stone at the bottom.\nIs that just for decoration?\nJOHN: Actually it does have a function.\nInstead of pushing a button, you turn the stone (Q23)\n.\nPROFESSOR: So it’s really just a novel way of starting the dishwasher.\nJOHN: That’s right.\nPROFESSOR: It’s a really nice design, but what makes it\ninnovative\n?\nJOHN: Well, I decided to make a dishwasher that uses\ncarbon\ndioxide\n.\nPROFESSOR: In place of water and\ndetergent\n?\nHow will you manage that?\nJOHN: The idea is to pressurise the\ncarbon\ndioxide\nso that it becomes a liquid.\nThe\nfluid\nis then released into the dishwasher where it cleans the dishes all by itself.\nPROFESSOR: Sounds like a brilliant idea!\nYour system will totally do away with the need for strong detergents.\nSo what happens once the dishes are clean?\nJOHN: Well, to allow them to dry, the liquid\ncarbon\ndioxide\nand the waste materials all go to an area called the holding\nchamber\n.\nThat’s where the liquid is depressurised and so it reverts to a gas (Q24)\n.\nThen the oil and\ngrease\nare separated out and sent to the waste system.\nPROFESSOR: It sounds like you’ve thought it all out very thoroughly.\nSo, what happens to the\ncarbon\ndioxide\nonce the process is complete?\nNot wasted I hope.\nJOHN: Actually, that’s where the real savings are made.\nThe\ncarbon\ndioxide\nis sent back to the cylinder and can be used again and again (Q25)\n.\nPROFESSOR: What a terrific idea.\nDo you think it will ever be built?\nJOHN: Probably not, but that’s OK.\nPROFESSOR: Well, I’m sure a lot of positive things will come out of your design.\nPROFESSOR: Now, you seem to have thought about everything so what exactly did you need me to help you with?\nJOHN: Well, my design has made it to the final stage of the competition and, in a few months’ time, I have to give a\npresentation\n(Q26)\n, and that’s the part I was hoping you could help me with.\nPROFESSOR: Right, well that should be easy enough.\nWhat have you managed to do so far?\nJOHN: Well, I’ve got detailed drawings to show how it will work and I’ve also written a 500-word paper on it.\nPROFESSOR: I see. Well, if you want to stand a good chance of winning you really need a\nmodel (Q27)\nof the machine.\nJOHN: Yes, I thought I might but I’m having a few problems.\nPROFESSOR: What is the main difficulty so far?\nLet me guess—is it the\nmaterials (Q28)\n?\nJOHN: Yes, I want it to look professional but everything that’s top quality is also very expensive.\nPROFESSOR: Look, projects like this are very important to us.\nThey really help lift our profile.\nSo why don’t you talk to the university about a\ngrant (Q29)\n?\nI can help you fill out the application forms if you like.\nJOHN: That would be great.\nPROFESSOR: You’d better show me this paper you’ve written as well.\nFor a global competition such as this you need to make sure the\ntechnical\n(Q30)\ndetails you’ve given are accurate and thorough.\nJOHN: That would be a great help.\nPROFESSOR: Is there anything else I can do?\nJOHN: Well, I’m really…\n剑桥雅思10 Test1 Section3雅思听力答案\n21.

living on a small island, – to\nfind out how\nharsh\nweather conditions shaped people’s lifestyles (Q23)\n.\nVICTOR\n: As part of their preparation before they left home, they learnt basic survival skills tike building a\nshelter\n.\nI guess they needed that knowledge\nin order to live wild in a remote location with few inhabitants, cut off by the sea (Q24)\n, which is what they were aiming to do.\nOLIVIA\n: An important part of your talk should be the\nradical\ntheory Heyerdahl formed from examining\nmysterious\nancient carvings that he happened to find on the island.\nI think you should finish with that.\nVICTOR:OK.\nOLIVIA\n: All right, Victor, so after your part I’ll talk about\nThor\nHeyerdahl’s adult life, continuing from the theory he had about\nPolynesian\nmigration\n.\nUp until that time of course, academics had believed that humans first migrated to the islands in Polynesia from Asia, in the west.\nVICTOR\n: Yes,\nthey thought that travel from the east was impossible, because of the huge, empty stretch of ocean that lies between the islands and the nearest inhabited land (Q25)\n.\nOLIVIA\n: Yes, but Heyerdahl spent ages studying the cloud movements, ocean currents and wind patterns to find if it was actually possible.\nAnd another argument was that there was no tradition of large ship-building in the communities lying to the east of Polynesia.\nBut Heyerdahl knew they made lots of\ncoastal\nvoyages in locally built canoes.\nVICTOR\n: Yes, or sailing on rafts, as was shown by the long voyage that Heyerdahl did next.\nIt was an\nincredibly\nrisky journey to undertake—sometimes I wonder if he did that trip for private reasons, you know?\nTo show others that he could have\nspectacular\nadventures.\nWhat do you think, Olivia?\nOLIVIA\n: Well,\nI think it was more a matter of simply trying out his idea, to see if\nmigration\nfrom the east was possible (Q26)\n.\nVICTOR\n: Yes, that’s probably it.\nAnd the poor guy suffered a bit at that time because the war forced him to stop his work for some years…\nOLIVIA\n: Yes.\nWhen he got started again and planned his\nepic\nvoyage, do you think it was important to him that he achieve it before anyone else did?\nVICTOR\n: Um, I haven’t read anywhere that that was his motivation.\nThe most important factor seems to have been that he use only ancient techniques and local materials to build his\nraft (Q27\n)\n.\nOLIVIA\n: Yes.\nI wonder how fast it went.\nVICTOR\n: Well, it took them 97 days from South America to the\nPacific\nIslands.\nOLIVIA\n: Mm.\nAnd after that, Heyerdahl went to Easter Island, didn’t he?\nWe should the purpose of that trip.\nI think he sailed there in a boat made out of reeds.\nVICTOR\n: No, that was later on in Egypt, Olivia.\nOLIVIA\n: Oh, yes, that’s right.\nVICTOR\n: But\nwhat he wanted to do was talk to the local people about their old stone carvings and then make one himself to learn more about the process (Q28)\n.\nOLIVIA\n: I see.\nWell, what a great life.\nEven though many of his theories have been disproven, he certainly left a lasting impression on many disciplines, didn’t he?\nTo my mind, he was the first person to establish what modem academics call practical\narchaeology (Q29)\n.\nI mean, that they try to recreate something from the past today, like he did with his\nraft\ntrip.\nIt’s unfortunate that his ideas about where Polynesians originated from have been completely discredited.\nVICTOR\n: Yes.\nRight, well, I’ll prepare a PowerPoint slide at the end that acknowledges our sources.\nI mainly used The Life and Work of\nThor\nHeyerdahl by William Oliver.\nI thought the research methods he used were very sound, although I must say\nI found the overall tone somewhat old-fashioned (Q30)\n.\nI think they need to do a new, revised edition.\nOLIVIA\n: Yeah.\nI agree.\nWhat about the subject matter—I found it realty challenging!\nVICTOR\n: Well, it’s a complex issue…\nOLIVIA\n: I thought the book had lots of good points.\nWhat did you think of…\n剑桥雅思10 Test2 Section3雅思听力答案\n21-22.

from marketing leaflets, but that didn’t involve anything I hadn’t done before.\nTIM\n:\nDo you think you got any better at managing your time and prioritising things (Q21)\n?\nYou always used to say you had trouble with that…\nLAURA\n: Oh, definitely.\nThere was so much pressure to meet the project deadline.\nAnd I also got better at explaining things and asserting my opinions (Q22)\n, because I had to have weekly consultations with the marketing manager and give him a progress report.\nTIM\n: It sounds as if you got a lot out of it then.\nLAURA\n: Absolutely.\nIt was really worthwhile …\nBut you know, the company benefited too…\nTIM\n: Yes, they must have done.\nAfter all, if they’d used a professional advertising agency to produce their brochure instead of doing it in-house,\npresumably\nthey’d have paid a lot more?\nLAURA\n: Oh, yes.\nI worked it out—-\nit would have been 250 per cent more (Q23)\n.\nAnd I thought the end result was good, even though we did everything on site.\nThe company has quite a powerful computer and I managed to borrow some scanning software from the university.\nThe new brochure looks really professional;\n–\nit enhances the image of the company straight away (Q24)\n.\nTIM\n: So in the long run it should help them to attract clients, and improve their sales figures?\nLAURA\n: That’s the idea.\nYeah.\nTIM\n: Well, all in all it sounds very positive — I think I will go ahead and apply for a placement myself.\nHow do I go about it?\nLAURA\n: It’s easy enough to do, because there’s a government agency called STEP- S-T-E-P – that organises placements for students.\nYou should start by getting their\nbooklet\nwith all the details—I expect you can download one from their website.\nTIM\n: Actually,\nthey’ve got copies in the\npsychology\ndepartment (Q25)\n—I’ve seen them there, I’ll just go to the office and pick one up.\nLAURA\n: Right.\nAnd then if I were you, after I’d looked at it I’d go over all the options with someone…\nTIM\n: I suppose I should ask my tutor’s advice.\nHe knows more about me than anyone.\nLAURA\n:\nOne of the career officers would be better (Q26)\n, they’ve got more knowledge about the jobs market than your personal tutor would have.\nTIM\n: OK…\nLAURA\n: And then when you know what you want you can register with STEP—you’ll find their address in the\nbooklet\n.\nAnd once you’ve\nregistered\nthey assign you to a\nmentor\nwho looks after your application.\nTIM\n: And then I suppose you just sit back and wait till you hear something?\nLAURA\n: They told me at the careers office that it’s best to be\nproactive\n, and\nget updates yourself by checking the website for new placement alerts (Q27)\n.\nYour\nmentor\nis supposed to keep you informed, but you can’t rely on that.\nTIM\n: I don’t suppose it’s a good idea to get in touch with companies directly, is it?\nLAURA\n: Not really…\nBut it is the company who notifies you if they want you to go for an interview.\nYou get a letter of invitation or an email from personnel departments (Q28)\n.\nTIM\n: And do I reply directly to them?\nLAURA\n: Yes, you do.\nSTEP only gets involved again once you’ve been made a job offer.\nTIM\n: Right…\nSo, once you’ve had an interview you should let your\nmentor\nknow what the outcome is (Q29)\n?\nI mean whether you’re offered a job, and whether you’ve decided to accept it?\nLAURA\n: That’s right.\nThey’ll inform the careers office once a placement has been agreed, so you don’t have to do that.\nTIM\n: Is that all then?\nLAURA\n: More or less.\nOnly once you’ve accepted an offer you’ll probably have to supply a reference, because the placement will be conditional on that.\nAnd\nthat’s something you should ask your own tutor to provide (Q30)\n.\nHe knows about your academic ability and also about your qualities, like reliability.\nTIM\n: Well, thanks very much for the information—I’m starting to look forward…\n剑桥雅思10 Test4 Section3雅思听力答案\n21-22.

I was interested that the researchers were actually a mix of psychologists and physicists.\nThat’s an unusual combination.\nLISA\n: Yeah. I got a little confused at first about which students the study was based on.\nThey weren’t actually majoring in physics –\nthey were majoring in what’s known as the STEM disciplines.\nThat’s science, technology, engineering and …\nGREG\n:\n… and math (Q21)\n.\nYes, but they were all doing physics courses as part of their studies.\nLISA\n: That’s correct.\nSo as I understood it, Miyake and co-started from the fact that women are underrepresented in introductory physics courses at college, and also that on average,  the women who do enrol on these courses perform more poorly than the men.\nNo one really knows why this is the case.\nGREG\n: Yeah.\nBut what the researchers wanted to find out was basically what they could do about the\nrelatively\nlow level of the women’s results (Q22)\n.\nBut in order to find a solution they needed to find out more about the nature of the problem.\nLISA\n: Right – now let’s see if I can remember …\nit was that in the physics class, the female students thought the male students all assumed that women weren’t any good at physics …\nwas that it?\nAnd they thought that the men expected them to get poor results in their tests.\nGREG\n: That’s what the women thought, and that made them nervous, so they did get poor results.\nBut\nactually they were wrong …\nNo one was making any assumptions about the female students at all (Q23)\n.\nLISA\n: Anyway, what Miyake’s team did was quite simple – getting the students to do some writing before they went into the physics class.\nWhat did they call it?\nGREG\n: Values-affirmation-\nthey had to write an essay focusing on things that were significant to them (Q24)\n, not particularly to do with the subject they were studying, but more general things like music, or people who mattered to them.\nLISA\n: Right. So the idea of doing the writing is that this gets the students thinking in a positive way.\nGREG\n:\nAnd putting these thoughts into words can relax them (Q25)\nand help them overcome the psychological factors that lead to poor performance.\nYeah. But what the researchers in the study hadn’t expected was that\nthis one activity raised the women’s physics grades from the C to the B range (Q26)\n.\nLISA\n: A huge change.\nPity it wasn’t to an A, but still!\nNo, but it does suggest that the women were seriously underperforming\nbeforehand\n, in comparison with the men.\nGREG\n: Yes. Mind you, Miyake’s article left out a lot of details.\nLike, did the students do the writing just once, or several times?\nAnd had they been told why they were doing the writing?\nThat might have affected the results (Q27)\n.\nLISA\n: You mean, if they know the researchers thought it might help them to improve, then they’d just try to fulfil that expectation?\nGREG\n: Exactly.\nGREG\n: So anyway, I thought for our project we could do a similar study, but investigate whether it really was the writing activity that had that result.\nLISA\n: OK. So we could ask them to do a writing task about something completely different …\nsomething more factual?\nLike a general knowledge topic.\nGREG\n: Maybe …\nor we could have half the students doing a writing task and half doing something else, like an oral task.\nLISA\n:\nOr even, half do the same writing task as in the original research and half do a factual writing task (Q28)\n.\nThen we’d see if it really is the topic that made the difference, or something else.\nGREG\n: That’s it. Good.\nSo at our meeting with the\nsupervisor\non Monday we can tell him we’ve decided on our project.\nWe should have our aims ready by then.\nI suppose we need to read the original study – the article’s just a summary.\nLISA\n: And there was another article I read, by Smolinsky.\nIt was about her research on how women and men perform in mixed teams in class, compared with single-sex teams and on their own.\nGREG\n: Let me guess …\nthe women were better at teamwork.\nLISA\n: That’s what I expected, but\nactually the men and the women got the same results whether they were working in teams or on their own (Q29)\n.\nBut I guess it’s not that relevant to us.\nGREG\n: What worries me anyway is how we’re going to get everything done in the time.\nLISA\n: We’ll be OK now we know what we’re doing.\nThough I’m not clear how we\nassess\nwhether the students in our experiment actually make any progress or not …\nGREG\n: NO. We may need some advice on that.\nThe main thing’s to make sure we have the right size sample, not too big or too small.\nLISA\n: That shouldn’t be difficult.\nRight, what do we need to do next?\nWe could have a look at the timetable for the science classes …\nor perhaps we should just make an appointment to see one of the science professors.\nThat’d be better (Q30)\n.\nGREG\n: Great.\nAnd we could even get to observe one of the classes.\nLISA\n: What for?\nGREG\n: Well …\nOK maybe let’s just go with your idea.\nRight, well …\n剑桥雅思11 Test1 Section3雅思听力答案\n21.

雅思听力高频词汇\n剑桥雅思11Test1Section4听力答案解析 Ocean Biodiversity\n剑桥雅思11 test1 section4\n雅思听力\n原文\nI’ve been looking at ocean\nbiodiversity\n, that’s the\ndiversity\nof species that live in the world’s oceans.\nAbout 20 years ago biologists developed the idea of what they called ‘\nbiodiversity\nhotspots’.\nThese are the areas which have the greatest mixture of species, so one example is\nMadagascar\n.\nThese hotspots are significant because they allow us to locate key areas for focusing efforts at\nconservation (Q31)\n.\nBiologists can identify hotspots on land, fairly easily, but until recently, very little was known about species\ndistribution\nand\ndiversity\nin the oceans, and no one even knew if hotspots existed there.\nThen a Canadian biologist called Boris Worm did some research in 2005 on data on ocean species that he got from the fishing industry.\nWorm located five hotspots for large ocean predators like sharks, and looked at what they had in common.\nThe main thing he’d expected to find was that they had very high concentrations of\nfood (Q32)\n.\nBut to his surprise that was only true for four of the hotspots – the remaining hotspot was quite badly off in that regard.\nBut what he did find was that in all cases, the water at the\nsurface (Q33)\nof the ocean had\nrelatively\nhigh temperatures, even when it was cool at greater depths, so this seemed to be a factor in supporting a\ndiverse\nrange of these large predators.\nHowever, this wasn’t enough on its own, because he also found that the water needed to have enough\noxygen (Q34)\nin it – so these two factors seemed necessary to support the high\nmetabolic\nrate of these large fish.\nA couple of years later, in 2007, a researcher called Lisa Ballance, who was working in California, also started looking for ocean hotspots, but not for fish – what she was interested in was marine\nmammals (Q35)\n, things like seals.\nAnd she found three places in the oceans which were hotspots, and what these had in common was that these hotspots were all located at boundaries between ocean currents, and this seems to be the sort of place that has lots of the\nplankton\nthat some of these species feed on.\nSo now people who want to protect the species that are endangered need to get as much information as possible.\nFor example, there’s an international project called the Census of Marine Life.\nThey’ve been surveying oceans all over the world, including the\nArctic\n.\nOne thing they found there which stunned other researchers was that there were large numbers of species which live below the\nice (Q36)\n– sometimes under a layer up to 20 metres thick.\nSome of these species had never been seen before.\nThey’ve even found species of\noctopus\nliving in these conditions.\nAnd other scientists working on the same project, but researching very different habitats on the ocean floor, have found large numbers of species congregating around volcanoes, attracted to them by the warmth and nutrients there.\nHowever, biologists still don’t know how serious the threat to their survival is for each individual species.\nSo a body called the Global Marine Species\nAssessment\nis now creating a list of endangered species on land, so they consider things like the size of the population – how many members of one species there are in a\nparticular\nplace – and then they look at their d\nistribution\nin\ngeographical\nterms, although this is quite difficult when you’re looking at fish, because they’re so mobile, and then thirdly they calculate the rate at which the\ndecline (Q37)\nof the species is happening.\nSo far only 1,500 species have been assessed, but they want to increase this figure to 20,000.\nFor each one they\nassess\n, they use the data they collect on that species to produce a\nmap (Q38)\nshowing its\ndistribution\n.\nUltimately they will be able to use these to figure out not only where most species are located but also where they are most threatened.\nSo finally, what can be done to\nretain\nthe\ndiversity\nof species in the world’s oceans?\nFirstly, we need to set up more reserves in our oceans, places where marine species are

Great to see you! I’m Jody, and I’ll be looking after both of you for the first month you’re working here at the Amersham Theatre. I’ll tell you something about the theatre now, then take you to meet two of the other staff.\nIt’s an old building, and it’s been modernised several times. In fact, as you can see, we’re carrying out a major refurbishment at the moment. The interior has just been repainted, and we’re about to start on the exterior of the building – that’ll be a big job. The work’s running over budget, so we’ve had to postpone installing an elevator. I hope you’re happy running up and down stairs! When the theatre was built, people were generally slimmer and shorter than now, and the seats were very close together.\nWe’ve replaced them with larger seats, with more legroom (Q11)\n. This means fewer seats in total, but we’ve taken the opportunity to install seats that can easily be moved, to create different acting spaces.\nWe’ve also turned a few storerooms over to other purposes, like using them for meetings (Q12)\n.\nWe try hard to involve members of the public in the theatre.\nOne way is by organising backstage tours (Q13)\n, so people can be shown round the building and learn how a theatre operates. These are proving very popular. What we’re finding is that people want to have lunch or a cup of coffee while they’re here, so we’re looking into the possibility of opening a café in due course.\nWe have a bookshop (Q14)\n, which specialises in books about drama, and that attracts plenty of customers. Then there are two large rooms that will be decorated next month, and they’ll be available for hire, for conferences and private functions, such as parties. We’re also considering hiring out costumes to amateur drama clubs.\nNow I want to tell you about our workshops. We recently started a programme of workshops that anyone can join. Eventually we intend to run courses in acting, but we’re waiting until we’ve got the right people in place as trainers. That’s proving more difficult than we’d expected! There’s a big demand to learn about the technical side of putting on a production, and\nour lighting workshop has already started, with great success (Q15)\n. We’re going to start one on sound next month. A number of people have enquired about workshops on make-up, and that’s something we’re considering for the future.\nA surprise success is the workshop on making puppets (Q16)\n– we happen to have someone working here who does it as a hobby, and she offered to run a workshop. It was so popular we’re now running them every month!\nNow, a word about the layout of the building. The auditorium, stage and dressing rooms for the actors are all below ground level. Here on the ground floor we have most of the rooms that the public doesn’t see. The majority are internal, so they have windows in the roof to light them.\nStanding here in the foyer, you’re probably wondering why the box office isn’t here, where the public would expect to find it. Well, you might have noticed it on your way in –\nalthough it’s part of this building, it’s next door, with a separate entrance from the road (Q17)\n.\nFor the\ntheatre manager’s office, you go across the foyer and through the double doors, turn right, and it’s the room at the end of the corridor, with the door on the left (Q18)\n.\nThe lighting box is where the computerised stage lighting is operated, and it’s at the back of the building.\nWhen you’re through the double doors, turn left, turn right at the water cooler, and right again at the end (Q19)\n. It’s the second room along that corridor. The lighting box has a window into the auditorium, which of course is below us.\nThe artistic director’s office is through the double doors, turn right, and it’s the first room you come to on the right-hand side (Q20)\n. And finally, for the moment, the room where I’ll take you next – the relaxation room. So if you’d like to come with me …\n剑桥雅思11 Test2 Section2雅思听力答案\n11-12. AB\n13-14. BD\n15-16. CE\n17. G\n18.

These are proving very popular.\n答案解析：backstage tours十分受欢迎，可见现在已经是有了的，因此确定B为答案。rooms for hire要到下个月才好，因此排除。而无论是cafe还是hire of costumes都仍在考虑中（look into the possibility和considering），可见现在还没有相关服务，因此统统排除。\n第14题答案：D\n对应原文：We have a bookshop, which specialises in books about drama\n答案解析：直接说了现在有书店，只要节奏不乱一般都能选出该选项来。\n第15题答案：C\n对应原文： A surprise success is the workshop on making puppets – we happen to have someone working here who does it as a hobby, and she offered to run a workshop. It was so popular we’re now running them every month!\n答案解析：如果大家无法根据making puppets同一句话中的success来判断现在已有这项服务的话，可以耐心往后听，听到every month就不会再有任何疑问。\n第16题答案：E\n对应原文：There’s a big demand to learn about the technical side of putting on a production, and our lighting workshop has already started, with great success\n答案解析：与11题和12题的出题方式类似，都是用现在完成时来表示已有的东西。需要大家对时态敏感一些。\n第17题答案：G\n对应原文： although it’s part of this building, it’s next door, with a separate entrance from the road\n答案解析：不少同学在看图的时候都会忽略右侧的入口，进而导致听到separate entrance时反应不过来。这里老烤鸭小编建议大家，在做地图题的时候务必把图上的已知地点都圈出来，以防遗漏。\n第18题答案：D\n对应原文：For the theatre manager’s office, you go across the foyer and through the double doors, turn right, and it’s the room at the end of the corridor, with the door on the left\n答案解析：这道题的关键点为turn right, at the end，以及the door on the left，只要能听到这几个关键词，并不难确定D为正确答案。\n第19题答案：B\n对应原文： When you’re through the double doors, turn left, turn right at the water cooler, and right again at the end\n答案解析：先左转，然后连续右转，一直走到头，由此确定B为答案，\n第20题答案：F\n对应原文：The artistic director’s office is through the double doors, turn right, and it’s the first room you come to on the right-hand side\n答案解析：右转右手边第一个房间就是，由此确定F为答案。"

I’ve got mine too. Let’s look at the aims of the trip first.\nHELEN: Right. What did you have?\nCOLIN: I just put something about getting experience of the different sorts of procedures used on a field trip.\nBut we need something about what causes different organisms to choose particular habitats (Q21)\n.\nHELEN: agree. And something about finding out how to protect organisms in danger of dying out?\nCOLIN: In our aims? But we weren’t really looking at that.\nHELEN: I suppose not. OK, now there’s the list of equipment we all had to bring on the field trip. What did they tell us to bring a ruler for?\nCOLIN: It was something about measuring the slope of the shore, but of course we didn’t need it because we were measuring wind direction, and we’d brought the compass for that …\nHELEN:\nBut not the piece of string to hold up in the air! Didn’t Mr. Blake make a fuss about us leaving that behind (Q22)\n.\nCOLIN: Yeah. He does go on. Anyway it was easy to get one from another of the students.\nHELEN: Now, the next section’s the procedure. I sent you the draft of that.\nCOLIN: Yeah. It was clear, but\nI don’t think we need all these details of what time we left and what time we got back and how we divided up the different research tasks (Q23)\n.\nHELEN: OK. I’ll look at that again.\nCOLIN: Then we have to describe our method of investigation in detail.\nSo let’s begin with how we measured wave speed. I was surprised how straightforward that was (Q24)\n.\nHELEN: I’d expected us to have some sort of high-tech device, not just stand there and count the number of waves per minute. Not very precise, but I suppose it was good enough. But the way we measured the amount of salt was interesting.\nCOLIN: In the water from the rock pools?\nHELEN: Yeah, oh, I wanted to check the chemicals we used in the lab when we analysed those samples – was it potassium chromate and silver nitrate?\nCOLIN: That’s right.\nHELEN: OK. And we need the map of the seashore. You just left that to me. And I had to do it while the tide was low, well that was OK,\nbut the place I started it from was down on the beach, then I realised I should have gone up higher to get better visibility (Q25)\n, so I had to start all over again. But at least I’d got the squared paper or I’d have had problems drawing it all to scale.\nCOLIN: Yes. It looks good. We could get a map of the region off the internet and see if we need to make any changes.\nHELEN: I had a look but I couldn’t find anything. But you took some pictures, didn’t you?\nCOLIN: Yeah. I’ll email you them if you want.\nHELEN: OK.\nI’ll make my amendments using those, then I can scan it into our report (Q26)\n. Great.\nHELEN: Now when we get to our findings I thought we could divide them up into the different zones we identified on the shore and the problems organisms face in each zone. So for the highest area …\nCOLIN: … the splash zone?\nHELEN: Yeah, we found mostly those tiny shellfish that have strong hard shells that act as protection.\nCOLIN: But not from other organisms that might eat them, predators?\nHELEN: NO, that’s not the main danger for them.\nBut the shells prevent them from drying out because they’re in the open air for most of the time (Q27)\n.\nCOLIN: Right. And since they’re exposed, they need to be able to find some sort of shelter, or cover themselves up,\nso they don’t get too hot (Q28)\n. Then in the middle and lower zones, nearer the sea, we need to discuss the effects of wave action …\nHELEN: Yes, and how organisms develop structures to prevent themselves from being swept away, or even destroyed by being smashed against the rocks.\nCOLIN: I haven’t done anything on the geological changes. I don’t know what to put for that.\nHELEN: NO, we weren’t concentrating on that. Maybe we need to find some websites.\nCOLIN: Good idea. I’ve got the lecture notes from Mr. Blake’s geology course, but they’re too general. But we could ask him which books on our Reading List might be most helpful.\nHELEN: Right. OK, now I did a draft of the section of sources of possible error in our research, but I don’t know if you agree. For example, the size of the sample, and whether it’s big enough to make any general conclusions from. But I thought actually we did have quite a big sample.\nCOLIN: We did. And our general method of observation seemed quite reliable. But we might not be all that accurate as far as the actual numbers go.\nHELEN: Yeah,\nwe might have missed some organisms – if they were hiding under a rock, for example (Q29)\n. I wasn’t sure about the way we described their habitats. I decided it was probably OK.\nCOLIN: Yeah, and the descriptions we gave of the smaller organisms, they weren’t very detailed, but they were adequate in this context.\nI’m not sure we identified all the species correctly though (Q30)\n.\nHELEN: OK, we’d better mention that.

I’m going to move on now to consider the design of public buildings, and I’ll illustrate this by referring to the new Taylor Concert Hall that’s recently been completed here in the city.\nSo, as with a domestic building, when designing a public building, an architect needs to consider the function of the building – for example, is it to be used primarily for entertainment, or for education, or for administration? The second thing the architect needs to think about is the context of the building, this includes its physical location, obviously, but it also includes the\nsocial (Q31)\nmeaning of the building, how it relates to the people it’s built for. And finally, for important public buildings, the architect may also be looking for a central symbolic idea on which to base the design, a sort of metaphor for the building and the way in which it is used.\nLet’s look at the new Taylor Concert Hall in relation to these ideas. The location chosen was a site in a run-down district that has been ignored in previous redevelopment plans. It was occupied by a\nfactory (Q32)\nthat had been empty for some years. The whole area was some distance from the high-rise office blocks of the central business district and shopping centre, but it was only one kilometre from the ring road. The site itself was bordered to the north by a\ncanal (Q33)\nwhich had once been used by boats bringing in raw materials when the area was used for manufacturing.\nThe architect chosen for the project was Tom Harrison. He found the main design challenge was the location of the site in an area that had no neighbouring buildings of any importance. To reflect the fact that the significance of the building in this quite run-down location was as yet unknown, he decided to create a building centred around the idea of a mystery – something whose meaning still has to be discovered.\nSo how was this reflected in the design of the building? Well, Harrison decided to create pedestrian access to the building and to make use of the presence of water on the site. As people approach the entrance, they therefore have to cross over a\nbridge (Q34)\n. He wanted to give people a feeling of suspense as they see the building first from a distance, and then close-up, and the initial impression he wanted to create from the shape of the building as a whole was that of a\nbox\n(Q35)\n. The first side that people see, the southern wall, is just a high, flat wall uninterrupted by any windows. This might sound off-putting, but it supports Harrison’s concept of the building – that the person approaching is intrigued and wonders what will be inside. And this flat wall also has another purpose. At night-time, projectors are switched on and it functions as a huge\nscreen (Q36)\n, onto which images are projected.\nThe auditorium itself seats 1500 people. The floor’s supported by ten massive pads. These are constructed from\nrubber\n(Q37)\n, and so are able to absorb any vibrations from outside and prevent them from affecting the auditorium. The walls are made of several layers of honey-coloured wood, all sourced from local beech trees. In order to improve the acoustic properties of the auditorium and to amplify the sound, they are not straight, they are\ncurved (Q38)\n. The acoustics are also adjustable according to the size of orchestra and the type of music being played. In order to achieve this, there are nine movable panels in the ceiling above the orchestra which are all individually motorized, and the walls also have\ncurtains (Q39)\nwhich can be opened or closed to change the acoustics.\nThe reaction of the public to the new building has generally been positive. However, the evaluation of some critics has been less enthusiastic. In spite of Harrison’s efforts to use local materials, they criticise the style of the design as being\ninternational (Q40)\nrather than local, and say it doesn’t reflect features of the landscape or society for which it is built.\n剑桥雅思11 Test2 Section4雅思听力答案\n31. social\n32. factory\n33. canal\n34. bridge\n35. box\n36. screen\n37. rubber\n38. curved\n39. curtains\n40. international"

It was occupied by a\nfactory\nthat had been empty for some years.\n答案解析：这道题的难点在于定位词与答案相距太远。部分同学可能会将district当成答案填了上去，但它跟前面的site并不能构成语义通顺的短语，因此排除。而空前词disused则与录音中的empty同义替换，由此锁定答案。\n第33题答案：canal\n对应原文：but it was only one kilometre from the ring road. The site itself was bordered to the north by a\ncanal\nwhich had once been used by boats bringing in raw materials when the area was used for manufacturing\n答案解析：这道题的难点有两个，一是不少同学都不熟悉canal这个单词，尤其是它的发音。二是前面ring road的干扰太过强烈。only on ekilometre很容易让人误以为是beside的同义替换。但仔细对比之后发现Bordered（接壤，相邻）确实要比1公里近一些。\n第34题答案：bridge\n对应原文：As people approach the entrance, they therefore have to cross over a\nbridge\n答案解析：听到approach意识到答案即将到来，by与cross over同义替换，由此确定答案为bridge。一些同学可能会将前面的water误以为是答案，但一方面说到water的时候还没有提到任何题干中的词汇，另一方面water填上去语义也不合适，因此排除。\n第35题答案：box\n对应原文：the initial impression he wanted to create from the shape of the building as a whole was that of a\nbox\n答案解析：这道题没有什么难度，基本属于送分题。空前词shape没有任何变化，听到之后很容易锁定box。\n第36题答案：screen\n对应原文：At night-time, projectors are switched on and it functions as a huge\nscreen\n, onto which images are projected\n答案解析：这道题的难点在于距离上一题和定位词都太过遥远，不过只要有耐心，一句句停下来，筛选每个重读单词，应该不难发现screen。\n第37题答案：rubber\n对应原文：The floor’s supported by ten massive pads. These are constructed from\nrubber\n答案解析：听到floors意识到答案即将到来，made与constructed from同义替换，由此确定rubber为答案，注意拼写即可。\n第38题答案：curved\n对应原文：In order to improve the acoustic properties of the auditorium and to amplify the sound, they are not straight, they are\ncurved\n答案解析：跟上道题有些类似，curved明显重读，注意拼写就好。\n第39题答案：curtains\n对应原文： there are nine movable panels in the ceiling above the orchestra which are all individually motorized, and the walls also have\ncurtains\n答案解析：跟31题同样的考察手法，都是在两个并列单词之间插入说明，以干扰大家的节奏。除此之外，curtains也经常在租房场景中出现，需要掌握拼写。\n第40题答案：international\n对应原文：In spite of Harrison’s efforts to use local materials, they criticise the style of the design as being\ninternational\nrather than local\n答案解析：没有什么难度，属于送分题，注意不要因为一时兴奋写成local就好。"

So parts of the town are no longer served by buses\n答案解析：录音中明确提到公交公司将注意力放在吸引最多游客的路线上，不再服务部分城镇。即公交路线没有以前那么多，由此确定C为答案。A选项描述的是过去的公交车，现在已经进行了更换，因此排除。录音中虽然确实提到了票价上涨，但随后补充到，考虑到平均收入水平，费用跟50年比并没有高很多，因此B同样错误。\n第12题答案：B\n对应原文：The new cycle paths, separating bikes from cars in most main roads, are being used far more than was expected, reducing traffic and improving air quality\n答案解析：录音中提到，自行车路线比预期中使用的要多，减少了交通并提升了空气质量。由此确定B为正确答案。A选项的尝试已经失败，而C选项banning of cars的影响仍需等待衡量。\n第13题答案：B\n对应原文：but many people prefer to use supermarkets and department stores in nearby large towns, as there are so few well-known chain stores here\n答案解析：根据原文，城镇中心已经修建了新的停车场，也有餐厅和咖啡馆，所以这些都不是人们不前来购物的原因，因此排除A和C。而B选项中的lack of对应so few，major retailers对应well-known chian stores，由此确定答案。\n第14题答案：A\n对应原文：\nOur hospital closed 15 years ago, which means journeys to other towns are\nunavoidable\n.\n答案解析：录音中提到，城镇自己的医院在15年前关门了，人们不可避免的要前往其他城镇。可见现在镇上并没有医院。由此确定A为正确答案。B选项和C选项在原文中都找不到对应的地方。\n第15题答案：C\n对应原文：\nEmployment patterns have changed, along with almost everything else.\nThe number of schools and colleges has increased, making that the main employment sector\n答案解析：根据录音，学校现在是主要的就业岗位提供者。main与题干中的largest number同义替换，由此确定C为正确答案。服务业重要性确实有所上升，但并没有说是最大的，而制造业则只是没有下降而已，因此排除A和B。\n第16题答案：G\n对应原文：\nInstead, the company has bought some adjoining land, and this will be used to increase the number of Parking spaces\n答案解析：录音中提到，公司买了附近的地块，用于增加停车空间。其中increase对应G选项中的expanded，由此确定答案。\n第17题答案：A\n对应原文：The Grand, the old cinema in the high street, will close at the end of the year, and reopen on a different site\n答案解析：这道题比较简单，原文中明确提到了reopen on a different site，对应A选项中的new location。除此之外，这种换地方的描述在听力中还经常被替换成relocate。\n第18题答案：C\n对应原文：The good news is that it will close for six weeks to be made safe and redecorated, and the improved building will open in July\n答案解析：只要大家知道C选项中的refurbished是重新装修的意思，这道题就很简单。否则的话，可能得用排除法去做。\n第19题答案：B\n对应原文：The council has managed to secure funding to keep the library open later into the evening, twice a week\n答案解析：录音中提到，图书馆的开放时间会持续到晚上更晚的时候，即营业时间延长，由此确定B为正确答案。\n第20题答案：F\n对应原文：Instead it will become the responsibility of a national body that administers most nature reserves in the country\n答案解析：录音中提到，当地委员会不再负责自然保护区。现在它是一个全国性机构的责任。即管理主体进行了更换，由此确定F为正确答案。"

雅思听力高频词汇\n剑桥雅思11Test3Section4听力答案解析 Ethnography in Business\n剑桥雅思11\ntest3 Section4\n雅思听力\n原文\nSo what I’m going to talk about to you today is something called\nEthnography\n.\nThis is a type of research aimed at exploring the way human cultures work.\nIt was first developed for use in\nanthropology\n, and it’s also been used in sociology and communication studies.\nSo what’s it got to do with business, you may ask.\nWell, businesses are finding that\nethnography\ncan offer them deeper insight into the possible needs of customers, either present or future, as well as providing valuable information about their\nattitudes (Q31)\ntowards existing products.\nAnd\nethnography\ncan also help companies to design new products or services that customers really want.\nLet’s look at some examples of how\nethnographic\nresearch works in business.\nOne team of researchers did a project for a company\nmanufacturing\nkitchen equipment.\nThey watched how cooks used measuring cups to measure out things like sugar and\nflour\n.\nThey saw that the cooks had to check and recheck the contents, because although the measuring cups had\nnumbers (Q32)\ninside them, the cooks couldn’t see these easily.\nSo a new design of cup was developed to overcome this problem, and it was a top seller.\nAnother team of\nethnographic\nresearchers looked at how cell phones were used in Uganda, in Africa.\nThey found that people who didn’t have their own phones could pay to use the phones of local entrepreneurs.\nBecause these customers paid in advance for their calls, they were eager to know how much\ntime (Q33)\nthey’d spent on the call so far.\nSo the phone company designed phones for use globally with this added feature.\nEthnographic\nresearch has also been carried out in computer companies.\nIn one company, IT systems administrators were observed for several weeks.\nIt was found that a large amount of their work involved communicating with colleagues in order to solve problems, but that they didn’t have a standard way of exchanging information from spreadsheets and so on.\nSo the team came up with an idea for\nsoftware (Q34)\nthat would help them to do this.\nIn another piece of research, a team observed and talked to nurses working in hospitals.\nThis led to the recognition that the nurses needed to access the computer records of their\npatients (Q35)\n, no matter where they were.\nThis led to the development of a\nportable\ncomputer\ntablet\nthat allowed the nurses to check records in locations throughout the hospital.\nOccasionally, research can be done even in environments where the researchers can’t be present.\nFor example, in one project done for an airline, respondents used their smartphones to record information during airline trips, in a study aiming at tracking the\nemotions (Q36)\nof passengers during a flight.\nSo what makes studies like these different from ordinary research?\nLet’s look at some of the general principles behind\nethnographic\nresearch in business.\nFirst of all, the researcher has to be completely open-minded – he or she hasn’t thought up a\nhypothesis\nto be tested, as is the case in other types of research.\nInstead they wait for the participants in the research to inform them.\nAs far as choosing the participants themselves is concerned, that’s not really all that different from ordinary research – the\ncriteria\naccording to which the participants are chosen may be something as simple as the age bracket they fall into, or the researchers may select them according to their\nincome (Q37)\n, or they might try to find a set of people who all use a\nparticular\nproduct, for example.\nBut it’s absolutely\ncrucial\nto\nrecruit\nthe right people as participants.\nAs well as the\ncriteria\nI’ve mentioned, they have to be\ncomfortable (Q38)\ntalking about themselves and being watched as they go about their activities.\nActually, most researchers say that people open up pretty easily, maybe because they’re often in their own home or workplace.\nSo what makes this type of research special is that it’s not just a matter of sending a\nquestionnaire\nto the participants, instead the research is usually based on first-hand\nobservation\n(Q39)\nof what they are doing at the time.\nBut that doesn’t mean that the researcher never talks to the participants.\nHowever, unlike in traditional research, in this case it’s the participant rather than the researchers who decides what direction the interview will follow.\nThis means that there’s less likelihood of the researcher imposing his or her own ideas on the participant.\nBut after they’ve said goodbye to their participants and got back to their office, the researchers’ work isn’t finished.\nMost researchers estimate that 70 to 80 per cent of their time is spent not on the collecting of data but on its\nanalysis (Q40)\n– looking at photos, listening to recordings and transcribing them, and so on.\nThe researchers may end up with hundreds of pages of notes.\nAnd to determine what’s significant, they don’t focus on the\nsensational\nthings or the unusual things, instead they try to identify a pattern of some sort in all this data, and to discern the meaning behind it.\nThis can result in some\ncompelling\ninsights that can in turn feed back to the whole design process.\n剑桥雅思11 Test3

As well as the\ncriteria\nI’ve mentioned, they have to be\ncomfortable\ntalking about themselves\n答案解析：听到participants意识到答案即将到来。从题干feel推测，空上应该填一个形容词，而录音这一句话里语义合适的只有comfortable一个，由此锁定答案。\n第39题答案：observation\n对应原文：instead the research is usually based on first-hand\nobservation\n(Q39)\nof what they are doing at the time\n答案解析：这道题没有明显的定位词，只能根据段首的so来判断上一题已经结束，39题答案即将到来。first-hand与direct同义替换，由此锁定observation。\n第40题答案：analysis\n对应原文：Most researchers estimate that 70 to 80 per cent of their time is spent not on the collecting of data but on its\nanalysis\n答案解析：听到time意识到答案即将到来。原文中设置了一个小小的干扰项，需要大家根据not … but …的结构来排除collecting，锁定analysis."

to hear something about the\npsychology\nstudy you did last year for your Master’s degree.\nSo how did you choose your subjects for that?\nJOANNA:\nWell, I had six subjects, all professional musicians, and all female.\nThree were violinists and there was also a cello player and a pianist and a flute player.\nThey were all very highly regarded in the music world and\nthey’d done quite\nextensive\ntours in different continents (Q21)\n, and quite a few had won prizes and competitions as well.\nSUPERVISOR:\nAnd they were quite young, weren’t they?\nJOANNA:\nYes, between 25 and 29 – the mean was 27. 8.\nI wasn’t specifically looking for artists who’d produced recordings, but this is something that’s just taken for granted these days, and they all had (Q22)\n.\nSUPERVISOR:\nRight.\nNow you collected your data through telephone interviews, didn’t you?\nJOANNA:\nYes.\nI realised if I was going to interview leading musicians it’d only be possible over the phone because they’re so busy (Q23)\n.\nI recorded them using a telephone recording adaptor.\nI’d been worried about the quality, but it worked out all right.\nI managed at least a 30-minute interview with each subject, sometimes longer.\nSUPERVISOR:\nDid doing it on the phone make it more stressful?\nJOANNA:\nI’d thought it might …\nit was all quite informal though and in fact they seemed very keen to talk.\nAnd I don’t think using the phone meant I got less rich data, rather the opposite in fact (Q24)\n.\nSUPERVISOR:\nInteresting.\nAnd you were looking at how performers dress for concert performances?\nJOANNA:\nThat’s right.\nMy research investigated the way players see their role as a musician and how this is linked to the type of clothing they decide to wear.\nBut that focus didn’t emerge immediately.\nWhen I started I was more interested in trying to investigate the impact of what was\nworn\non those listening (Q25)\n, and also whether\nsomeone like a violinist might adopt a different style of clothing from, say, someone playing the flute or the\ntrumpet (Q26)\n.\nSUPERVISOR:\nIt’s interesting that the choice of dress is up to the individual, isn’t it?\nJOANNA:\nYes, you’d expect there to be rules about it in orchestras, but that’s quite rare.\nSUPERVISOR:\nYou only had women performers in your study.\nWas that because male musicians are less worried about fashion?\nJOANNA:\nI think a lot of the men are very much influenced by fashion, but\nin social terms the choices they have are more limited …\nthey’d really upset audiences if they strayed away from quite narrow boundaries (Q27)\n.\nSUPERVISOR:\nHmm.\nNow, popular music has quite different expectations.\nDid you read Mike Frost’s article about the dress of women performers in popular music?\nJOANNA:\nNo.\nSUPERVISOR:\nHe points out that a lot of female singers and musicians in popular music tend to dress down in performances, and wear less\nfeminine\nclothes, like jeans instead of skirts, and\nhe suggests this is because otherwise they’d just be discounted as trivial (Q28)\n.\nJOANNA:\nBut you could argue they’re just wearing what’s practical …\nI mean, a pop-music concert is usually a pretty energetic affair.\nSUPERVISOR:\nYes, he doesn’t make that point, but I think you’re probably right.\nI was interested by the effect of the audience at a musical performance when it came to the choice of dress.\nJOANNA:\nThe subjects I interviewed felt this was really important.\nIt’s all to do with what we understand by performance as a public event.\nThey believed the audience had certain expectations and it was up to them as performers to fulfil these expectations, to show a kind of esteem … (Q29)\nSUPERVISOR:\n…they weren’t afraid of looking as if they’d made an effort to look good.\nJOANNA:\nMmm.\nI think in the past the audience would have had those expectations of one another too, but that’s not really the case now, not in the UK anyway.\nSUPERVISOR:\nNo.\nJOANNA:\nAnd I also got interested in what sports scientists are doing too, with regard to clothing.\nSUPERVISOR:\nMusicians are quite\nvulnerable\nphysically, aren’t they, because the movements they carry out are very intensive and\nrepetitive\n, so\nI’d imagine some features of sports clothing could\nsafeguard\nthe players from the Potentially dangerous effects of this sort of thing (Q30)\n.\nJOANNA:\nYes, but musicians don’t really consider it.\nThey avoid clothing that obviously restricts their movements, but that’s as far as they go.\nSUPERVISOR:\nAnyway, coming back to your own research, do you have any idea where you’re going from here?\nJOANNA:\nI was thinking of doing a study using an audience, including …\n剑桥雅思11 Test4 Section3雅思听力答案\n21-22.

atmosphere\n剑桥雅思11听力第四套题目第四部分的主题为土壤在吸收大气中二氧化碳的作用。录音大体可以分为三部分，分别介绍了Rattan Lal的发现，土壤吸收二氧化碳的原理，以及未来的发展。\n点击查看这篇雅思听力中需要大家掌握的\n重点词汇\n与具体题目的\n答案解析\n：\n雅思备考听力篇 剑11 test 4 section 4 雅思听力高频词汇\n剑桥雅思11Test4Section4听力答案解析 The use of soil to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere\n剑桥雅思11\ntest4Section4\n雅思听力\n原文\nAs we saw in the last lecture, a major cause of climate change is the rapid rise in the level of\ncarbon\ndioxide\nin the atmosphere over the last century.\nIf we could reduce the amount of CO2, perhaps the rate of climate change could also be slowed down.\nOne\npotential\nmethod involves enhancing the role of the soil that plants grow in, with regard to absorbing CO2.\nRattan Lal, a soil scientist from Ohio State University, in the USA, claims that the world’s agricultural soils could potentially absorb 13 per cent of the\ncarbon\ndioxide\nin the atmosphere – the\nequivalent\nof the amount released in the last 30 years.\nAnd research is going on into how this might be achieved.\nLal first came to the idea that soil might be valuable in this way not through an interest in climate change, but rather out of concern for the land itself and the people dependent on it.\nCarbon-rich soil is dark,\ncrumbly\nand\nfertile\n, and retains some water.\nBut\nerosion\ncan occur if soil is\ndry (Q31)\n, which is a likely effect if it contains inadequate amounts of\ncarbon\n.\nErosion\nis of course bad for people trying to grow crops or breed animals on that\nterrain\n.\nIn the 1970s and’80s, Lal was studying soils in Africa so devoid of organic matter that the ground had become extremely\nhard (Q32)\n, like\ncement\n.\nThere he met a\npioneer\nin the study of global warming, who suggested that\ncarbon\nfrom the soil had moved into the atmosphere.\nThis is now looking increasingly likely.\nLet me explain.\nFor millions of years,\ncarbon\ndioxide\nlevels in the atmosphere have been regulated, in part, by a natural partnership between plants and microbes – tiny organisms in the soil.\nPlants absorb CO2 from the air and transform it into\nsugars (Q33)\nand other carbon-based substances.\nWhile a\nproportion\nof these\ncarbon\nproducts remain in the plant, some transfer from the\nroots (Q34)\nto\nfungi\nand soil microbes, which store the\ncarbon\nin the soil.\nThe invention of\nagriculture\nsome 10,000 years ago disrupted these ancient soil-building processes and led to the loss of\ncarbon\nfrom the soil.\nWhen humans started draining the natural\ntopsoil\n, and ploughing it up for planting, they\nexposed\nthe buried\ncarbon\nto oxygen.\nThis created\ncarbon\ndioxide\nand released it into the air.\nAnd in some places, grazing by\ndomesticated\nanimals has removed all\nvegetation\n, releasing\ncarbon\ninto the air.\nTons of\ncarbon\nhave been stripped from the world’s soils – where it’s needed – and pumped into the atmosphere.\nSo what can be done?\nResearchers are now coming up with evidence that even modest changes to farming can significantly help to reduce the amount of\ncarbon\nin the atmosphere.\nSome growers have already started using an approach known as regenerative\nagriculture\n.\nThis aims to boost the\nfertility\nof soil and keep it\nmoist\n(Q35)\nthrough established practices.\nThese include keeping fields planted all year round, and increasing the\nvariety (Q36)\nof plants being grown.\nStrategies like these can significantly increase the amount of\ncarbon\nstored in the soil, so agricultural researchers are now building a case for their use in combating climate change.\nOne American investigation into the\npotential\nfor storing CO2 on agricultural lands is taking place in California.\nSoil scientist Whendee Silver of the University of California, Berkeley, is conducting a first-of-its-kind study on a large\ncattle (Q37)\nfarm in the state.\nShe and her students are testing the effects on\ncarbon\nstorage of the\ncompost\nthat is created from waste – both agricultural, including\nmanure\nand cornstalks, and waste produced in\ngardens (Q38)\n, such as leaves, branches, and lawn trimmings.\nIn Australia, soil ecologist Christine Jones is testing another promising soil-enrichment strategy.\nJones and 12 farmers are working to build up soil\ncarbon\nby cultivating\ngrasses (Q39)\nthat stay green all year round.\nLike composting, the approach has already been proved experimentally;\nJones now hopes to show that it can be applied on working farms and that the resulting\ncarbon\ncapture can be accurately measured.\nIt’s hoped in the future that projects such as these will demonstrate the role that farmers and other land managers can play in reducing the harmful effects of greenhouse gases.\nFor example, in countries like the United States, where most farming operations use large applications of\nfertiliser\n, changing such long-standing habits will require a change of system.\nRattan Lal argues that farmers should receive\npayment (Q40)\nnot just for the corn or beef they produce, but also for the\ncarbon\nthey can store in their soil.\nAnother study being carried out …\n剑桥雅思11 Test4

Well that all sounds good.\nAnd can we get\nlunch (Q4)\nthere?\nTC employee:\nYou can, and it’s very good, though it’s not included in the basic cost.\nYou pay when you get there.\nVISITOR:\nRight.\nVISITOR:\nSo is there anything else to do over that side of the lake?\nTC employee:\nWell, what you can do is take a bike over on the ship and then go on cycling trip.\nThere’s a\ntrail\nthere called the Back Road – you could easily spend three or four hours exploring it, and the scenery’s wonderful.\nThey’ll give you a\nmap (Q5)\nwhen you get your ticket for the\ncruise\n– there’s no extra charge.\nVISITOR:\nWhat’s the\ntrail\nlike in terms of difficulty?\nTC employee:\nQuite challenging in places.\nIt wouldn’t be suitable for your seven-year-old.\nIt needs someone who’s got a bit more\nexperience (Q6)\n.\nVISITOR:\nHmm. Well, my daughter loves cycling and so do I, so maybe the two of us could go, and my wife and son could stay on the farm.\nThat might work out quite well.\nBut we don’t have bikes here…is there somewhere we could rent them?\nTC employee:\nYes, there’s a place here in the city.\nIt’s called Ratchesons.\nVISITOR:\nI’ll just make a note of that, er, how do you spell it?\nTC employee:\nR-A-T-C-H-E-S-O-N-S (Q7)\n.\nIt’s just by the\ncruise\nship terminal.\nVISITOR:\nOK.\nTC employee:\nYou’d also need to pick up a repair kit for the bike from there to take along with you, and you’d need to take along a snack and some water – it’d be best to get those in the city.\nVISITOR:\nFine. That shouldn’t be a problem.\nAnd I assume I can rent a\nhelmet\n(Q8)\nfrom the bike place?\nTC employee:\nSure, you should definitely get that.\nIt’s a great ride, but you want to be well prepared because it’s very remote-you won’t see any\nshops (Q9)\nround there, or anywhere to stay, so you need to get back in time for the last boat.\nVISITOR:\nYeah.

We need to start planning our paper on public libraries.\nHave you thought of an angle yet?\nSTEWART:\nWell, there’s so much we could look into.\nHow libraries have changed over the centuries, for\ninstance\n, or how different countries organize them.\nWhat do you think, Trudie?\nTRUDIE:\nMaybe we should concentrate on this country, and try and relate the changes in libraries to external developments, like the fact that far more people can read than a century ago, and that the local population may speak lots of different languages (Q21)\n.\nSTEWART:\nWe could include something about changes in the source of funding, too.\nTRUDIE:\nYes, but remember we’re only supposed to write a short paper, so it’s probably best if don’t go into funding in any detail.\nSTEWART:\nRight. Well, shall we just brainstorm a few ideas, to get started?\nTRUDIE:\nOk. We obviously need to look at the impact of new technology, particularly the internet.\nNow that lots of books have been digitalized, people can access them form their own computers at home.\nSTEWART:\nAnd if everyone did that, libraries would be\nobsolete\n.\nTRUDIE:\nYes.\nSTEWART:\nBut the digitalized books that are available online for free are mostly out of copyright, aren’t they?\nAnd copyright in this country lasts for 70 years after the author dies.\nSo you won’t find the latest best-seller or up-to-date information (Q22)\n.\nTRUDIE:\nThat’s an important point.\nAnyway, I find it hard to concentrate when I’m reading a long text on a screen.\nI’d much rather read a physical book.\nAnd it takes longer to read on a screen.\nSTEWART:\nOh, I prefer it.\nI suppose it’s just a personal\npreference\n.\nTRUDIE:\nMm. I expected that libraries will go on evolving in the next few years.\nSome have already become centers where community activities take place, like local clubs meeting there.\nI think that’ll become even more common.\nSTEWART:\nI’d like to think so, and that they’ll still be serving their traditional function, but I’m not so sure.\nThere’re financial implications, after all.\nWhat I’m afraid will happen is that books and magazines will all disappear, and there’ll just be rows and rows of computers (Q23)\n.\nThey won’t look anything like the libraries we’re used to.\nTRUDIE:\nWell, we’ll see.\nTRUDIE:\nI’ve just had an idea.\nWhy don’t we make an\nin-depth\nstudy of our local public library as background to our paper?\nSTEWART:\nYes, that’d be interesting, and raise all sorts of issues.\nLet’s make a list of possible things we could ask about, then work out some sort of structure.\nFor\ninstance\n, um, we could interview some of the staff, and find out whether the library has its own\nbudget (Q24)\n, or if that’s\ncontrolled by the local council.\nTRUDIE:\nAnd what their policies are.\nI know they don’t allow food, but I’d love to find out what types of noise they ban – there always seems to be a lot of talking, but never music.\nI don’t know if that’s a policy or it just happens.\nSTEWART:\nAh, I’ve often wondered. .\nThen there are things like how the library is affected by\nemployment (Q25)\nlaws.\nI suppose there are rules about working hours, facilities for staff and so on.\nTRUDIE:\nRight. Then there are other issues relating to design of the building and how customers use it.\nLike what measures does the library take to ensure their\nsafety (Q26)\n?\nThey’d need floor coverings that aren’t\nslippery\n, and\nemergency\nexits, for\ninstance\n.\nOh, and another thing-there’s the question of the kind of\ninsurance (Q27)\nthe library needs to have, in case anyone gets injured.\nSTEWART:\nYes, that’s something else to find out.\nYou know something I’ve often wondered?\nTRUDIE:\nWhat’s that?\nSTEWART:\nWell, you know they’ve got an archive of local newspapers going back years?\nWell, next to it they’ve got the\ndiary (Q28)\nof a well-known politician from the late 19th century.\nI wonder why it’s there.\nDo you know what his connection was with this area?\nTRUDIE:\nNo idea.\nLet’s add it to our list of things to find out.\nOh, I’ve just thought – you know people might ask in the library about local organizations, like sports clubs?\nWell, I wonder if they keep a\ndatabase (Q29)\n, or whether they just look online.\nSTEWART:\nRight. I quite fancy finding out what the differences are between a library that’s open to the public and one that’s part of a\nmuseum\n(Q30)\n, for example – they must be very different.\nTRUDIE:\nMmm.

So the first value I am going to discuss is collaboration, Er, let me give you an example.\nOn a management training course I once attended, we were put into groups and had to\nconstruct\na\nbridge (Q33)\nacross a stream, using building blocks that we were given.\nThe rule was that everyone in the team had to move at least one building block during the construction.\nThis was intended to encourage teamwork.\nBut it was really a job best done by one person.\nThe other teams tried to\ncollaborate\non building the structure, and descended into\nconfusion (Q34)\n, with everyone getting in each other’s way.\nOur team leader solved the challenge brilliantly.\nShe simply asked everyone in the team to move a piece a few centimeters, to comply with the rule, and then let the person in the team with an\naptitude\nfor puzzles like this build it alone.\nWe finished before any other team.\nMy point is that the task wasn’t really suited to teamworking, so why make it one?\nTeamwork can also lead to inconsistency – a common cause of poor sales.\nIn the case of a\nsmartphone (Q35)\nthat a certain company launched, one director wanted to target the business market, and another demanded it was aimed at consumers.\nThe company wanted both directors to be involved, so gave the product a consumer-friendly name, but marketed it to companies.\nThe result was that it met the needs of neither group.\nIt would have better to let one director or the other have this way, not both.\nNow industriousness, or hard work.\nIt’s easy to mock people who say they work hard: after all, a\nhamster\nrunning around in a wheel is working hard and getting nowhere.\nOf course hard work is valuable, but only when properly targeted.\nOtherwise it wastes the\nresources (Q36)\nthat companies value most – time and energy.\nAnd that’s bad for the\norganization\n.\nThere’s a management model that groups people according to four criteria: clever, hard-working, stupid and lazy.\nHere ‘lazy’ means having a rational determination not to carry out\nunnecessary\n(Q37)\ntasks.\nIt doesn’t mean trying to avoid work\naltogether\n.\nMost people display two of these characteristics, and the most valuable people are those who are both clever and lazy: they possess intellectual clarity, and they don’t rush into making decisions.\nThey come up with solutions to save the time and energy spent by the stupid and hard-working group.\nInstead of throwing more man-hours at a problem, the clever and lazy group looks for a more effective solution.\nNext we come to creativity.\nThis often works well – creating an attention-grapping TV commercial, for example, might lead to increased sales.\nBut it isn’t always a good thing.\nSome advertising campaigns are remembered for their creativity, without having any effect on sales.\nThis happened a few years ago with the\nlaunch\nof a\nchocolate bar (Q38)\n;\nsubsequent\nresearch showed that plenty of consumers remembered the advert, but had no idea what was being advertised.\nThe troubles is that the creator derives pleasure from coming up with the idea, and wrongly assumes the audience for the campaign will share that feeling.\nA company that brings out thousands of new products may seem more creative than a company that only has a few, but it may be too creative, and make smaller profits.\nCreativity needs to be targeted to solve a\nproblem (Q39)\nthat the company has identified.\nJust coming up with more and more novel products isn’t necessarily a good thing.\nAnd finally, excellence.\nWe all know companies that claim they ‘strive for excellence’, but it takes a long time to achieve excellence.\nIn business, being first with a product is more\nprofitable\nthan having the best product.\nA major study of company performance compared pioneers – that is, companies bringing out the first version of a\nparticular\nproduct – with followers, the companies that copied and improved on that product.\nThe study found that the pioneers commanded an average\nmarket share (Q40)\nof 29 percent, while the followers achieved less than half that, only 13 percent – even though their product might have been better.\nInsisting on excellence in everything we do is time-consuming, wastes energy and leads to losing out on opportunities.\nSometimes, second-rate work is more worthwhile than excellence.\n“Make sure it’s excellent” sounds like a good approach to business, but the “just get-started” approach is likely to be more successful.\n剑桥雅思12 Test5 Section4雅思听力答案\n31. damage\n32. side effects\n33. bridge\n34. confusion\n35. smartphone\n36. resources\n37. unnecessary/not necessary\n38. chocolate bar\n39. problem\n40. market share"

I’ve now almost succeeded in finalising plans for our tour, so I’ll bring you up to date with what I know\nAs you know, we’re flying first to Munich, on Monday the 4th.\nThe flight is at 11.30, so it’s too early to have lunch at the airport.\nI suggest we meet there for coffee at\n10 (Q11)\n, which should give us plenty of time for breakfast before we leave home.\nWhen we arrive in Munich, we’ll be met at the airport by Claus Bauer.\nClaus works for a tour operator (Q12)\n, and he’ll look after us for the time we’ll be in Germany.\nHe’s already liaised with the managers of the theatres we’re going to visit, and he’s also arranged for an officer of the National Theatre in Munich to show us round the theatre one afternoon during our stay.\nNow last time we discussed this trip, I didn’t have the precise cost for hotel rooms, but now I have.\nThe normal rate at the hotel where we’re staying is 150 euros a night for a double room.\nI’d hoped to get that down to 120 euros,\nbut in fact I’ve been able to negotiate a rate of 110 (Q13)\n.\nThat’ll be reflected in the final payment which you’ll need to make by the end of this week.\nOn Tuesday, the day after our arrival, I had hoped we could sit in on a\nrehearsal\nat one of the theatres, but unfortunately that’s proved very difficult to arrange, so instead we’ll have a coach trip to one of the amazing castles in the mountains south of Munich.\nOn Tuesday evening, we’ll all have dinner together in a restaurant near our hotel.\nFrom talking to you all about your preferences, it was clear that a typical local restaurant would be too meat-oriented for some of you.\nSome of you suggested an Italian restaurant,\nbut I must confess that I decided to book a Lebanese one (Q14)\n, as we have plenty of opportunities to go to an Italian restaurant at home.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the director of the play we’re going to see that evening will talk to us at the theatre (Q15)\n.\nShe’ll describe the whole process of producing a play, including how she chose the actors, and, as the play we’re going to see is a modern one, how she worked with the\nplaywright\n.\nRight. Now I’d just like to make a few points about the plays we’re going to see, partly because it might influence your choice of clothes to take with you!\nThe play we’re seeing on Wednesday evening is a modern one, and we’re going to the premiere (Q16)\n, so it’ll be quite a dressy occasion, though of course you don’t have to dress formally.\nI gather it’s rather a multimedia production, with amazing lighting effects and a soundtrack of electronic music, though unfortunately the\nplaywright\nis ill and is unlikely to be able to attend.\nOn Thursday we’re seeing a play that was first performed last year, when it was commissioned to mark a hundred years since the birth in the town of a well-known scientist (Q17)\n.\nWe’re going to see a\nrevival\nof that production, which aroused a lot of interest.\nFriday’s play will really make you think hard about what clothes to pack, as it’ll be in the garden of a palace (Q18)\n.\nIt’s a beautiful setting, but I’d better warn you, there won’t be much protection from the wind.\nOn Saturday, we’re going by coach to a theatre in another town, not far from Munich.\nThis will be the opening of a drama festival, and the mayor and all the other dignitaries of the town will be attending (Q19)\n.\nAfter the performance, the mayor is hosting a reception for all the audience, and there’ll be a band playing traditional music of the region.\nAnd after having a day off on Sunday,\nour final play is on Monday, and it’s in the stunning setting of the old Town Hall, which dates back to the 14th century (Q20)\n.\nThe performance marks the fifty years that the lead actor has been on stage, and the play is the one where he made his first professional appearance, all those years ago.\nAnd the day after that, we’ll be flying back home.\nNow have you got any questions before I…\n剑桥雅思12 Test6 Section2雅思听力答案\n11.

You must be James.\nI’m Beth Cartwright – please call me Beth.\nJames: Thank you.\nBeth: Now as this is your first\ntutorial\nsince you started on the Scandinavian Studies course, I’d like to find out something about you.\nWhy did you decide to take this course?\nJames: Well, my mother is Danish, and although we always lived in England, she used to talk about her home a lot, and that made me want to visit\nDenmark\n.\nWe hardly ever did, though – my mother usually went on her own.\nBut whenever her relations or friends were in England they always came to see us (Q21).\nBeth: I see. So I assume you already speak Danish, one of the languages you’ll be studying.\nJames: I can get by when I talk to people, though I’m not terribly accurate.\nBeth: Now you probably know that you’ll spend the third year of the course abroad.\nHave you had any thoughts about that?\nJames: I’m really looking forward to it.\nAnd although\nDenmark\nseems the obvious place to go, because of my family connections, I’d love to spend the time in Iceland.\nBeth: Oh, I’m sure it can be arranged.\nDo you have any plans for when you graduate?\nA lot of students go on to take a master’s degree.\nJames: I think the four years of the undergraduate course will be enough for me.\nI’m interested in\njournalism\n, and I\nquite like the idea of moving to\nScandinavia\nand writing for magazines (Q22)\n.\nI’d find that more creative than translating, which I suppose most graduates do.\nBeth: OK. Now how are you finding the courses you’re taking this term, James?\nJames: Well, I’m really enjoying the one on Swedish cinema.\nBeth: That’ll continue next term,\nbut the one on Scandinavian literature that’s running at the moment will be replaced by more specialised courses (Q23)\n.\nOh, and by the way, if you’re interested in watching Danish television programmes – there’s going to be a course on that the term after next.\nJames: That sounds good.\nBeth: Have you started thinking about the literature paper that you have to write in the next few weeks?\nJames: Yes, my first choice would be to do something on the Icelandic sagas.\nBeth: Hmm. The trouble with that is that a lot of people choose that topic, and it can be difficult to get hold of the books you’ll need.\nWhy not leave that for another time?\nJames: Right.\nBeth: You might find modern novels or 19th century playwrights interestin\ng\n.\nJames:\nI’ve read or seen several plays in translation, so that would be a good idea\n(Q24)\n.\nBeth: Fine. I’ll put you down for that topic.\nJames: Right. So what would you advise me to aim at in the paper?\nBeth: First I suggest you avoid taking one writer and going into a great deal of detail.\nThat approach certainly has its place,\nbut I think you first need to get an understanding of the literature in the context of the society in which it was produced – who it was written for, how it was\npublished, and so on (Q25)\n.\nI also think that’s more fruitful than placing it within the history of the\ngenre\n.\nJames: OK, that sounds reasonable.\nJames: Could I ask for some advice about writing the paper I’m working on about the Vikings?\nI have to do that this week, and I’m a bit stuck.\nBeth: Of course. Have you decided yet what to write about?\nJames: No, I haven’t. There’s so much that seems interesting – Viking settlement in other countries, trade,\nmythology\n…\nBeth: Well,\nwhat I suggest is that you read an\nassignment\na student wrote last year (Q26)\n, which is kept in the library.\nIt’s short and well focused, and I’m sure you’ll find it helpful.\nI’ll give you the details in a moment.\nTextbooks usually cover so many topics, it can be very difficult to choose just\none.\nJames: OK. I’ve got a DVD of the film about the Vikings that came out earlier this year.\nShould I watch that again?\nBeth: If it’s the one I am thinking of, hmm, I’d ignore it – it’s more fantasy than reality.\nBut I’ve got a recording of a\ndocumentary\nthat you should watch (Q27)\n.\nIt makes some interesting and\nprovocative\npoints, which I think will help you to focus your topic.\nJames: Right.\nJames:\nSo then should I work out an\noutline (Q28)\n?\nBeth:\nYes. Just headings for different sections, at this stage.\nAnd then you should start looking for suitable articles and books to draw on, and take notes which you organise according to those headings (Q29)\n.\nJames: I see.\nBeth:\nThen put short phrases and sentences as bullet points under each heading (Q30)\n.\nMake sure that this\nskeleton\nmakes sense and flows properly, before writing up the paper in full.\nJames: OK. Thanks, that’s very helpful.\n剑桥雅思12 Test6 Section3雅思听力答案\n21. C\n22. B\n23. C\n24. A\n25. C\n26. E\n27. G\n28. D\n29. C\n30. A"

Much of this is covered by the term\nbullying\n答案解析：这道题没有明显的定位词，只能根据general category和covered by the term的相近意思来判断答案为bullying。不过好在霸凌在中文中也属于比较常见的词汇，根据读音理解答案意思不是很困难。\n第32题答案：superiority\n对应原文：But often it’s caused by someone who feels the need to show their\nsuperiority\nover someone else\n答案解析：同样没有明显的定位词，只能根据show和prove的同义替换来确定答案为supriority。不过该单词在录音中读的很重，只要会拼写，还是不太容易错过的。\n第33题答案：personality\n对应原文：In some cases one person simply dislikes the other, on the basis that the\npersonality\nof one is in some way incompatible with that of the other person\n答案解析：听到In some cases这一承上启下的连接词，意识到录音来到第33题，空前词differences in在原文中并没有很明显的同义替换，不过我们仍然可以根据词性以及重读，锁定personality。\n第34题答案：structural\n对应原文：\nSome conflicts arise when people are more interested in promoting themselves and their team than in the company as a whole.\nThese conflicts are called\n‘\nstructural’\n答案解析：这道题有个小技巧。在雅思听力中，当空上要填某一具体名称，类型或者前后有引号的时候，答案前通常都会有called作为提示，大家可以注意一下。\n第35题答案：absence\n对应原文：Conflict obviously affects the individuals concerned – the situation is likely to be very stressful for victims, resulting in their\nabsence\nfrom work, possibly for months.\n答案解析：根据stress与stressful的同义替换定位到这句话，空前词cause与resulting in对应，由此确定答案为absence。\n第36题答案：confidence\n对应原文：\nCEOs – has uncovered some of the reasons why they may treat colleagues badly.\nMany CEOs combine two opposing characteristics:\nconfidence\n答案解析：听到CEOs意识到答案即将到来，空前词both与combine two… 对应，由此确定答案为confidence。\n第37题答案：visions\n对应原文：And it’s particularly difficult to\ntackle\nthe situation where colleagues, managers and board members are all trying to achieve their own\nvisions\n答案解析：这道题没有明显的定位词，空前词different在原文中也没有很明显的对应。基础好的同学可以根据句义锁定visions。而基础不太好的同学，则可以根据词性和重读进行筛选。\n第38题答案：democratic\n对应原文：Interestingly, though, a company with a more\ndemocratic\nbusiness model, can suffer more, when uncertainty about who to report to leads to conflicting demands.\n答案解析：听到小标题之后，还有一两句话才到答案对应的内容。不过空前词more并没有任何改变，可以很轻易锁定democratic为正确答案。剩下的问题就主要是拼写了。\n第39题答案：respect\n对应原文：\nA good manager, at any level, will make efforts to earn the\nrespect\nof the people they work with, particularly those who report to them\n答案解析：根据manager与bosses的对应定位到这句话，空前词gain与earn同义替换，根据修饰关系确定答案为respect。\n第40题答案：mediator\n对应原文：However, if one of the parties in a conflict sees human resources as simply a mouthpiece for the chief\nexecutive\n, then an external\nmediator\nmight be able to help\n答案解析：根据outside与external的同义替换定位到这句话，通过词性与重读筛选出human resources, moutpiece, chief executive, 以及mediator。前三者填上去语义都不合适（chief executive还是这一小段的主题词），通过排除法确定答案为mediator。"

Enjoying your new job?\nYou’re working at the library, aren’t you?\nSUSIE:\nYes. I started when the library re-opened a month ago. It’s great.\nPAUL:\nActually Carol and I have been meaning to join for a while.\nSUSIE:\nOh, you should. It doesn’t cost anything, and the new library has all sorts of facilities.\nIt’s not just a place where you borrow books.\nFor\ninstance\n, there’s an area with comfortable seats where you can sit and read the magazines they have there.\nSome people spend the whole morning there.\nPAUL:\nMmm. Wish I had that amount of time to spend!\nSUSIE:\nYes, you must be pretty busy at present, with the children and everything?\nPAUL:\nWe are, yes. But we’re hoping to get away this summer.\nWe’re thinking of going to Greece.\nSUSIE:\nWell, we’ve got a much larger section of the library devoted to\ntravel (Q1)\nbooks now, so you should come and have a look.\nI can’t remember if there’s anything specifically on Greece, but I should think so.\nPAUL:\nOK. Now Carol’s organising a project for the history class she teaches at school – it’s about life in the town a hundred years ago.\nDo you have anything that might be useful?\nSUSIE:\nYes, actually we’ve now got a new section with materials on the\nhistory (Q2)\nof the town and surrounding region.\nPAUL:\nRight. I’ll tell her.\nYou can’t always find that sort of thing on the internet.\nNow in the old library there used to be a separate room with reference books.\nIt was a really nice quiet room.\nSUSIE:\nYes. We’ve put those books in the main part of the library now, but we do have a room called the community room.\nIt can be hired out for meetings.\nBut at other times people can use it to\nstudy (Q3)\n.\nPAUL:\nI might use that.\nIt’s hard to find anywhere quiet at home sometimes.\nSUSIE:\nI can’t remember how old your son and daughter are.\nWe’ve introduced a special section of fiction written specially for\nteenagers (Q4)\n, but they might be a bit young for that?\nPAUL:\nYes, they would be.\nSUSIE:\nWell, we do have lots of activities for younger children.\nPAUL:\nYes?\nSUSIE:\nFor example we have a Science Club.\nAt the next meeting, they’re going to be doing experiments with stuff that everyone has in the\nkitchen (Q5)\n– sugar and\nflour\nand so on.\nPAUL:\nThey might be interested, yes.\nSUSIE:\nAnd we have a competition for children called Reading Challenge.\nThat doesn’t begin until after the end of term.\nThey have to read six books, and they get a certificate if they manage it.\nPAUL:\nSo that gives them something to do while they’re on holiday, instead of getting bored.\nSUSIE:\nThat’s the idea. And there’s special activities for adults too.\nOn Friday we have a local author called Tanya Streep who’s going to be talking about her new novel. .\nIt’s called “Catch the Mouse” and she based the story on a\ncrime (Q6)\nthat actually took place here years ago.\nPAUL:\nRight. We’re not free on Friday, but I’ll look out for the book.\nSUSIE:\nNow this probably isn’t for you, but we do have IT support available for members.\nWe get quite a few older people coming along who are wanting to get up to speed with computer technology.\nIt’s on Tuesday mornings – they don’t need to make an\nappointment (Q7)\nor anything, they just turn up.\nPAUL:\nWell, my mother might be interested, I’ll let her know.\nSUSIE:\nOK. And there’s another service which you wouldn’t expect from a library,\nwhich is a free medical check-up.\nThe hospital arranges for someone to come along and measure the level of\nsugar (Q8)\nin your blood,\nand they check\ncholesterol\nlevels at the same time.\nPAUL:\nReally?\nSUSIE:\nYes, but that’s only for the over-60s, so you wouldn’t qualify.\nPAUL:\nOK, Well, I’ll tell my mother, she might be interested.\nSUSIE:\nWhat other information…\nWell, we do have a little shop with things like wall charts and greetings cards, and also\nstamps (Q9)\n,\nso you can post the cards straightaway, which is really useful.\nPAUL:\nYeah. Well, I’ll bring the children round at the weekend and we’ll join.\nOh, one more thing – I’ll be bringing the car, is there\nparking (Q10)\navailable?\nSUSIE:\nYes. and it’s free in the evening and at weekends.\nPAUL:\nPerfect.

I know what a pain it is when you forget that.\nDAVE:\nOK. so we can compare what we’ve read.\nThen we have to decide on a\nparticular\nproblem or need at our site.\nAnd then think about who we’re going to interview to get more information.\nNATALIE:\nOK. So who’d that be?\nThe people who work there (Q22)\n?\nAnd\npresumably\nsome of the tourists too?\nDAVE:\nYes, both those groups.\nSo we’ll have to go to the sites to do that, I suppose.\nBut we might also do some of our interviewing away from the sites –\nwe could even contact some people here in the city, like administrators involved in overseeing tourism (Q23)\n.\nNATALIE:\nOK. So we’ll need to think about our interview questions and fix times and places for the meetings.\nIt’s all going to take a lot of time.\nDAVE:\nMmm. And if we can, we should ask our interviewees if they can bring along some\nnumerical\ndata that we can add to support our findings.\nNATALIE:\nAnd photographs?\nDAVE:\nI think we have plenty of those already.\nBut Dr Baker also said we have to establish with our interviewees whether we can identify them in our case study, or whether they want to be\nanonymous (Q24)\n.\nNATALIE:\nOh, I wouldn’t have thought of that.\nOK, once we’ve got all this information, I suppose we have to analyse it.\nDAVE:\nYes, put it all together and choose what’s relevant to the problem we’re focusing on, and\nanalyse that carefully to find out if we can identify any trends or regularities there (Q25)\n.\nThat’s the main thing at this stage, rather than concentrating on details or lots of facts.\nNATALIE:\nOK. And then once we’ve analysed that, what next?\nDAVE:\nWell, then we need to think about what we do with the data we’ve selected to make it as clear as possible to our readers.\nThings like graphs, or tables, or charts…\nNATALIE:\nRight.\nDAVE:\nThen the case study itself is mostly quite standard; we begin by presenting the problem, and giving some background, then go through the main sections, but\nthe thing that surprised me is that in a normal report we’d end with some suggestions to deal with the problem or need we\nidentified.\nBut in a case study we end up with a question or a series of questions to our readers.\nAnd they decide what ought to be done (Q26)\n.\nNATALIE:\nOh, I hadn’t realised that.\nNATALIE:\nSo basically, the problem we’re addressing in our case study of the Horton Castle site is why so few tourists are visiting it.\nAnd we’ll find out more from our interviews, but I did find one report on the internet that suggested that one reason might be because as far as transport goes, access is difficult.\nDAVE:\nI read that too, but that report was actually written ten years ago, when the road there was really bad, but that’s been improved now.\nAnd I think there’s plenty of\nfascinating\nstuff there for a really good day out.\nBut you’d never realise it from the castle website – maybe that’s the problem\n(Q27)\n.\nNATALIE:\nYes, it’s really dry and boring.\nDAVE:\nI read somewhere a suggestion that what the castle needs is a visitor centre.\nSo we could have a look for some information about that on the internet.\nWhat would we need to know?\nNATALIE:\nWell, who’d use it for a start?\nIt’d be good to know what categories the visitors fell into too, like school parties or retired people, but I think we’d have to talk to staff to get that information.\nDAVE:\nOK. And as we’re thinking of suggesting a visitor centre we’d also have to look at\npotential\nproblems.\nI mean, obviously it wouldn’t be cheap to set up.\nNATALIE:\nNo, but it could be a really good investment.\nAnd as it’s on a historical site it’d need to get special planning permission, I expect.\nThat might be hard (Q28)\n.\nDAVE:\nRight, especially as the only possible place for it would be at the entrance, and that’s right in front of the castle.\nNATALIE:\nMmm.\nDAVE:\nBut it could be a good thing for the town of Horton.\nAt present it’s a bit of a ghost town.\nOnce they’ve left school and got any skills or qualifications.\nThe young people all get out as fast as they can to get jobs in the city.\nAnd the only people left are children and those who’ve retired (Q29)\n.\nNATALIE:\nRight. Something else we could investigate would be the\npotential\ndamage that tourists might cause to the castle site, I mean their environmental impact.\nAt present the tourists can just\nwander\nround wherever they want,\nbut if numbers increase, there might have to be some\nrestrictions, like sticking to marked ways.\nAnd there’d need to be guides and wardens around to make sure these were enforced (Q30)\n.\nDAVE:\nYes, we could look at that too.

So who’d that be?\nThe people who work there?\nAnd\npresumably\nsome of the tourists too\n答案解析：听到上文interview与这句话中的who意识到答案即将到来，原文中提到的第一种人是现场工作人员，由此锁定E为正确答案。\n第23题答案：H\n对应原文：we could even contact some people here in the city, like administrators involved in overseeing tourism\n答案解析：虽然23题与visitors并列，但两者距离较远，很容易让人产生答案已经过了的误解。不过只要大家耐心等待，无论是根据amdministrators，还是overseeing tourism都可以确定H为正确答案。\n第24题答案：B\n对应原文：But Dr Baker also said we have to establish with our interviewees whether we can identify them in our case study, or whether they want to be\nanonymous\n答案解析：这道题的难点主要在于anonymous一词，如果大家知道它是匿名的意思，就可以很轻易的锁定B选项。\n第25题答案：A\n对应原文：analyse that carefully to find out if we can identify any trends or regularities there\n答案解析：空前词identify全词出现，根据trends和regularities很容易确定A选项patterns为答案。\n第26题答案：F\n对应原文：\nthe thing that surprised me is that in a normal report we’d end with some suggestions to deal with the problem or need we\nidentified.\nBut in a case study we end up with a question or a series of questions to our readers.\nAnd they decide what ought to be done\n答案解析：这道题需要稍微结合一下上下文。原文中先提到，一般的报告中要以解决方案结尾，但在案例研究中则要以问题结尾。也就是说，目前他们所做的案例研究不能以解决方案结尾，由此确定F为正确答案。\n第27题答案：A\n对应原文：But you’d never realise it from the castle website – maybe that’s the problem\n答案解析：录音中提到城堡的网站有问题，人们在上面感受不到它的魅力。由此确定A选项（宣传）为正确答案。B选项错在现在路已经修好了，而C选项则跟原文意思相反。\n第28题答案：C\n对应原文：\nAnd as it’s on a historical site it’d need to get special planning permission, I expect.\nThat might be hard\n答案解析：special planning permission与C选项dealing with planning restrictions同义替换，由此确定答案。录音中确实提到资金需求比较大，但强调这会是一项很好的投资，因此排除A，而B选项则完全没有提到。\n第29题答案：B\n对应原文：\nThe young people all get out as fast as they can to get jobs in the city.\nAnd the only people left are children and those who’ve retired\n答案解析：录音中提到，年轻人因为在城市中能够找到工作，都在逃离Horton镇，留下的都是孩子或者老年人。即很少有成年劳动力，因此确定B为正确答案。A选项和C选项都属于过度推测，在录音中找不到直接的对应。\n第30题答案：B\n对应原文：\nbut if numbers increase, there might have to be some\nrestrictions, like sticking to marked ways.\nAnd there’d need to be guides and wardens around to make sure these were enforced\n答案解析：录音中提到的解决方案是确保游客按照规定路线行进，由此确定B为正确答案。A选项和C选项都没有提到。"

And have you had any experience of leading cycle trips?\nMARGARET: Yes, I’ve led several bike tours in\nAfrica (Q3)\n.\nThe trip to India that I had arranged to lead next month has now been cancelled, so when I saw you were advertising for tour leaders, I decided to apply.\nBOB: OK. Now we normally have two or three leaders on a trip, depending on the size of the group.\nSome tours are for very experienced cyclists, but we’ve got a tour coming up soon in Spain, which is proving so popular we need an additional leader.\nIt’s a cycling holiday for families. Would that suit you?\nMARGARET: It certainly would.

You’re quite a long way from where I live, so I’ll drive over on Monday.\nShould I bring anything to the interview?\nBOB: We’ll have your application form, of course, but we’ll need to see any certificates you’ve got that are relevant, in cycling, first aid, or whatever.\nMARGARET: OK.\nBOB: And at the interview we’d like to find out about your experience of being a tour guide.\nSo could you prepare a ten-minute\ntalk (Q10)\nabout that please?\nYou don’t need slides or any complicated equipment — just some notes.\nMARGARET: Right.

What are you going to talk about?\nKATIE:\nIt’s about film adaptations of Shakespeare’s plays.\nI’ve got very interested in all the different approaches that film directors take.\nJOE:\nUhuh.\nKATIE:\nSo I thought I’d start with Giannetti, who’s a professor of film and literature.\nAnd in one of his books he came up with a\nstraightforward\nclassification (Q21)\nof film adaptations based on how faithful they are to the original plays and novels.\nJOE:\nRight.\nKATIE:\nI’ve already made some notes on that, so I just need to sort those out before the presentation.\nI thought that next I’d ask the class to come up with the\nworst (Q22)\nexamples of Shakespeare adaptations that they’ve seen, and to say why.\nThat should be more fun than having their favourite versions.\nJOE:\nYes, I can certainly think of a couple!\nKATIE:\nRight. Next I want to talk about Rachel Malchow.\nI came across something on the internet about her work on film adaptations, and I was thinking of showing some film clips to illustrate her ideas.\nJOE:\nWill you have enough time, though? Both to prepare and during the presentation?\nAfter all, I doubt if you’ll be able to find all the clips you want.\nKATIE:\nHmm. Perhaps you’re right.\nOK, well, I’d better do some\nslides (Q23)\ninstead, saying how various films relate to what she says.\nThat should encourage discussion.\nJOE:\nMmm.\nKATIE:\nNext I want to say something about how plays may be chosen for\nadaptation\nbecause they’re concerned with\nissues (Q24)\nof the time when the film is made.\nJOE:\nYou mean things like\npatriotism\n, or the role of governments?\nKATIE:\nExactly. It’s quite tricky, but I’ve got a few ideas I’d like to discuss.\nKATIE:\nAnd finally I want to talk about a few adaptations that I think illustrate a range of approaches, and make some comments on them.\nDo you know the Japanese film Ran?\nJOE:\nI haven’t seen it. It was based on Shakespeare’s King Lear, wasn’t it?\nKATIE:\nThat’s right.\nIt was a very loose\nadaptation\n, using the same situation and story, but moving it to 16th century Japan instead of 16th century Britain (Q25)\n.\nSo for example the king’s daughters become sons, because in Japanese culture at that time, women couldn’t succeed to the throne.\nJOE:\nOK. I hope you’re going to talk about the 1993 film of Much Ado About Nothing.\nI think that’s one of the best Shakespeare films.\nIt really brings the play to life, doesn’t it?\nKATIE:\nYes, I agree.\nAnd I think filming it in Italy, where the play is set, makes you see what life was like at the time of the play (Q26)\n.\nJOE:\nAbsolutely. Right, what’s next?\nKATIE:\nEr, next.\nI thought Romeo & Juliet, the 1996 film, which moves the action into the present day (Q27)\n.\nJOE:\nYes, it worked really well, I thought — changing the two feuding families in the original to two competing business empires, even though they’re speaking in the English of the original play.\nKATIE:\nYou’d expect it would sound really\nbizarre\n, but I found I soon got used to it.\nJOE:\nMe too.\nKATIE:\nThen I thought I’d include a real Hollywood film, one that’s intended to appeal to a mass commercial audience.\nJOE:\nThere must be quite a number of those.\nKATIE:\nYes，\nbut I’ve picked the 1996 film of\nHamlet\n.\nIt included every line of the text，but it’s more like a typical action hero movie (Q28)\n— there are loads of special effects, but no unifying\ninterpretation\nof the play.\nJOE:\nAll show and no\nsubstance\n.\nKATIE:\nExactly.\nThen there’s Prospero’s Books, based on The Tempest.\nThat was really\ninnovative\n, from a stylistic point of view\n.\nJOE:\nDidn’t it include dance and singing and\nanimation\nas well as live actors\n(Q29)\n.?\nKATIE:\nYes, it did. I also want to mention Looking for Richard.\nDid you ever see it?\nJOE:\nNo. But I’ve read about it.\nIt was a blend of a\ndocumentary\nwith a few scenes from Richard III, wasn’t it (Q30)\n?\nKATIE:\nThat’s right. It’s more a way of looking into how people nowadays connect with the\nplaywright\n— the play is really just the starting point.\nAnd that’ll be where I finish.\nJOE:\nWell, it sounds as though it’ll be very interesting.\n剑桥雅思12 Test8 Section3雅思听力答案\n21. classification\n22. worst\n23. slides\n24. issues\n25.

雅思听力高频词汇\n剑桥雅思12Test8Section4听力答案解析 Noise in cities\n剑桥雅思12 test8 section4\n雅思听力\n原文\nThis lecture will be about the science of acoustics, the study of sound, in relation to urban environments such as cities.\nAs an\nacoustic\nengineer myself, I think this is an area where we’re likely to see great changes.\nIn the past, researching urban soundscapes was simple.\nWe measured levels of sound in decibels, so I used to take my sound meter and I measured the noise somewhere, and then I might ask a sample of people to say at what level the sound became\nannoying\n.\nWith data like this,\nacoustic\nengineers have been able to build up what we call noise maps, maps of the sound environment.\nBut actually these aren’t a lot of use.\nWhat they do show is that the highest noise levels are generally on roads — well, that’s not really very surprising.\nBut there’s quite a lot going on that these maps don’t show, because they can’t capture the complex way that sound varies over time.\nSo they ignore important issues such as the noise someone might hear from the open windows or\ngardens (Q31)\nof their neighbours, and this sort of noise can be quite significant in summer.\nWe don’t have any databases on this sort of information.\nAs well as that, these records of sound levels take no account of the fact that people vary in their perceptions of noise — so someone like me with years of working in acoustics might be very different from you in that regard.\nBut anyway, even though these noise maps are fairly\ncrude\n, they’ve been useful in providing information and raising awareness that noise matters, we need to deal with it and so it’s a\npolitical (Q32)\nmatter.\nAnd that’s important – we need rules and regulations because noise can cause all sorts of problems.\nThose of you who are city-dwellers know that things go on 24 hours a day, so city-dwellers often suffer from\ninterrupted\nsleep.\nIt’s also known that noise can lead to a rise in levels of stress, due to physical changes in the body affecting the\ncomposition\nof the blood.\nAnd there are other problems as well, for\ninstance\nif schoolchildren don’t have a quiet place to\nstudy\n, their\nwork (Q33)\nwill suffer.\nNow, one problem with decibel measurement is that it doesn’t\ndifferentiate\nbetween different types of noise.\nSome types of sounds that most people would probably think of as nice and relaxing might well score quite highly in decibel levels – think of the sound made by a\nfountain (Q34)\nin a town square, for example.\nThat’s not necessarily something that we’d want to control or reduce.\nSo maybe researchers should consider these sorts of sounds in urban design.\nThis is going to be tricky because just measuring decibel levels isn’t going to help us here.\nInstead, many researchers are using\nsocial (Q35)\nscience techniques, studying people’s emotional response to sound by using questionnaires and so on.\nSo what exactly do people want to hear in an urban environment?\nSome recent interdisciplinary research has come out with results that at first sight seem\ncontradictory\n– a city needs to have a sense of activity so it needs to be\nlively (Q36)\nwith sounds like the\nclack\nof high heels on a pavement or the hiss of a coffee machine, but these mustn’t be too\nintrusive\n, because at the same time we need to be able to relax.\nOne of the major problems in achieving this will be getting architects and town planners to use the research.\nApart from studying the basics of acoustics, these people receive very little\ntraining (Q37)\nin this area.\nBut in fact they should be regarding sound as an opportunity to add to the experience of urban living,\nwhereas\nat present they tend to see it as something to be avoided or reduced as far as possible, or something that’s just a job for engineers like the street\ndrainage\nsystem.\nWhat’s needed is for noise in cities to be regarded as an\naesthetic\nquality, as something that has the qualities of an art form.\nIf we acknowledge this, then we urgently need to know what governs it and how designers can work with it.\nWe need to develop a complex understanding of many factors.\nWhat is the relationship between sound and\nculture (Q38)\n?\nWhat can we learn from disciplines such as\npsychology\nabout the way that sound interacts with human development and social relationships, and the way that sound affects our thought and feelings?\nCan we learn anything from physics about the\nnature (Q39)\nof sound itself?\nToday’s powerful technologies can also help us.\nTo show us their ideas and help us to imagine the effect their buildings will have, architects and town planners already use virtual reality – but these programs are\nsilent (Q40)\n.\nIn the future such programs could use realistic sounds, meaning that soundscapes could be explored before being built.\nSo hopefully, using the best technology we can lay our hands on, the city of the future will be a pleasure to the ears as well as the eyes.\n剑桥雅思12 Test8 Section4雅思听力答案\n31. garden(s)\n32. political\n33. work/study\n34. fountain\n35. social\n36. lively\n37. training\n38. culture\n39.

I wanted to find out about cookery classes. I believe there are some one-day classes for tourists?\nOFFICIAL:\nWell, they’re open to everyone, but tourists are always welcome. OK, let me give you some details of what’s available. There are several classes. One very popular one is at the Food Studio.\nWOMAN:\nOK.\nOFFICIAL:\nThey focus on seasonal products, and as well as teaching you how to cook them, they also show you how to\nchoose (Q1)\nthem.\nWOMAN:\nRight, that sounds good. How big are the classes?\nOFFICIAL:\nI’m not sure exactly, but they’ll be quite small.\nWOMAN:\nAnd could I get a\nprivate (Q2)\nlesson there?\nOFFICIAL:\nI think so … let me check, yes, they do offer those. Though in fact most of the people who attend the classes find it’s a nice way of getting to know one another.\nWOMAN:\nI suppose it must be, yes.\nOFFICIAL:\nAnd this company has a special deal for clients where they offer a discount of\n20 percent (Q3)\nif you return for a further class.\nWOMAN:\nOK. But you said there were several classes?\nOFFICIAL:\nThat’s right. Another one you might be interested in is Bond’s Cookery School. They’re quite new, they just opened six months ago, but I’ve heard good things about them. They concentrate on teaching you to prepare\nhealthy (Q4)\nfood, and they have quite a lot of specialist staff.\nWOMAN:\nSo is that food for people on a diet and things like that? I don’t know if I’d be interested in that.\nOFFICIAL:\nWell, I don’t think they particularly focus on low calorie diets or weight loss. It’s more to do with recipes that look at specific needs, like including ingredients that will help build up your\nbones (Q5)\nand make them stronger, that sort of thing.\nWOMAN:\nI see. Well, I might be interested, I’m not sure. Do they have a website I could check?\nOFFICIAL:\nYes, just key in the name of the school – it’ll come up. And if you want to know more about them, every Thursday evening they have a\nlecture (Q6)\nat the school. It’s free and you don’t need to book or anything, just turn up at 7.30. And that might give you an idea of whether you want to go to an actual class.\nOFFICIAL:\nOK, there’s one more place you might be interested in. That’s got a rather strange name, it’s called The\nArretsa (Q7)\nCentre – that’s spelled A-R-R-E-T-S-A.\nWOMAN:\nOK.\nOFFICIAL:\nThey’ve got a very good reputation. They do a bit of meat and fish cookery but they mostly specialise in\nvegetarian (Q8)\ndishes.\nWOMAN:\nRight. That’s certainly an area I’d like to learn more about. I’ve got lots of friends who don’t eat meat. In fact, I think I might have seen that school today. Is it just by the\nmarket (Q9)\n?\nOFFICIAL:\nThat’s right. So they don’t have any problem getting their ingredients. They’re right next door. And they also offer a special two-hour course in how to use a\nknife (Q10)\n. They cover all the different skills – buying them, sharpening, chopping techniques. It gets booked up quickly though so you’d need to check it was available.\nWOMAN:\nRight, well thank you very much.

My name’s Phil Sutton, and I’m chairman of the Highways Committee. We’ve called this meeting to inform members of the public about the new regulations for traffic and parking we’re proposing for Granford. I’ll start by summarising these changes before we open the meeting to questions.\nSo, why do we need to make these changes to traffic systems in Granford? Well, we’re very aware that traffic is becoming an increasing problem. It’s been especially noticeable with the increase in heavy traffic while they’ve been building the new hospital.\nBut it’s the overall rise in the volume of traffic of all kinds that’s concerning us (Q11)\n. To date there’s not been any increase in traffic accidents, but that’s not something we want to see happen, obviously.\nWe recently carried out a survey of local residents, and their responses were interesting.\nPeople were very concerned about the lack of visibility on some roads due to cars parked along the sides of the roads (Q12)\n. We’d expected complaints about the congestion near the school when parents are dropping off their children or picking them up, but this wasn’t top of the list, and nor were noise and fumes from trucks and lorries, though they were mentioned by some people.\nWe think these new traffic regulations would make a lot of difference. But we still have a long way to go. We’ve managed to keep our proposals within budget, just, so they can be covered by the Council.\nBut, of course, it’s no good introducing new regulations if we don’t have a wav of making sure that everyone obeys them (Q13)\n, and that’s an area we’re still working on with the help of representatives from the police force.\nOK, so this slide shows a map of the central area of Granford, with the High Street in the middle and School Road on the right. Now, we already have a set of traffic lights in the High Street at the junction with Station Road,\nbut we’re planning to have another set at the other end, at the School Road junction (Q14)\n, to regulate the flow of traffic along the High Street.\nWe’ve decided we definitely need a pedestrian crossing. We considered putting this on School Road, just outside the school, but in the end we decided that could lead to a lot of traffic congestion\nso we decided to locate it on the High Street, crossing the road in front of the supermarket (Q15)\n. That’s a very busy area, so it should help things there.\nWe’re proposing some changes to parking.\nAt present, parking isn’t allowed on the High Street outside the library, but we’re going to change that, and allow parking there(Q16)\n, but not at the other end of the High Street near School Road.\nThere’ll be a new ‘No Parking’ sign on School Road, just by the entrance to the school (Q17)\n, forbidding parking for 25 metres. This should improve visibility for drivers and pedestrians, especially on the bend just to the north of the school.\nAs far as disabled drivers are concerned, at present they have parking outside the supermarket, but lorries also use those spaces, s\no we’ve got two new disabled parking spaces on the side road up towards the bank (Q18)\n. It’s not ideal, but probably better than the present arrangement.\nWe also plan to widen the pavement on School Road.\nWe think we can manage to get an extra half-metre on the bend just before you get to the school, on the same side of the road (Q19)\n.\nFinally,\nwe’ve introduced new restrictions on loading and unloading for the supermarket, so lorries will only be allowed to stop there before 8 am. That’s the supermarket on School Road (Q20)\n– we kept to the existing arrangements with the High Street supermarket.\nOK. So that’s about it. Now, would anyone …\n剑桥雅思13 Test1 Section2雅思听力答案\n11.

Were you thinking of something to do with seeds?\nJACK:\nThat’s right. I thought we could look at seed germination – how a seed begins to grow.\nEMMA:\nOK. Any particular reason? I know you’re hoping to work in plant science eventually…\nJACK:\nYeah, but practically everything we do is going to feed into that. No,\nthere’s an optional module on seed structure and function in the third year that I might do, so I thought it might be useful for that (Q21)\n. If I choose that option, I don’t have to do a dissertation module.\nEMMA:\nGood idea.\nJACK:\nWell, I thought for this experiment we could look at the relationship between seed size and the way the seeds are planted. So, we could plant different sized seeds in different ways, and see which grow best.\nEMMA:\nOK.\nWe’d need to allow time for the seeds to come up.\nJACK:\nThat should be fine if we start now. A lot of the other possible experiments need quite a bit longer (Q22)\n.\nEMMA:\nSo that’d make it a good one to choose. And I don’t suppose it’d need much equipment; we’re not doing chemical analysis or anything. Though that’s not really an issue, we’ve got plenty of equipment in the laboratory.\nJACK:\nYeah. We need to have a word with the tutor if we’re going to go ahead with it though. I’m sure our aim’s OK. It’s not very ambitious but the assignment’s only ten percent of our final mark, isn’t it?\nBut we need to be sure we’re the only ones doing it (Q23)\n.\nEMMA:\nYeah, it’s only five percent actually, but it’d be a bit boring if everyone was doing it.\nJACK:\nDid you read that book on seed germination on our reading list?\nEMMA:\nThe one by Graves? I looked through it for my last experiment, though it wasn’t all that relevant there. It would be for this experiment, though.\nI found it quite hard to follow – lots about the theory, which I hadn’t expected (Q24)\n.\nJACK:\nYes, I’d been hoping for something more practical. It does include references to the recent findings on genetically-modified seeds, though.\nEMMA:\nYes, that was interesting.\nJACK:\nI read an article about seed germination by Lee Hall.\nEMMA:\nAbout seeds that lie in the ground for ages and only germinate after a fire?\nJACK:\nThat’s the one. I knew a bit about it already, but not about this research.\nHis analysis of figures comparing the times of the fires and the proportion of seeds that germinated was done in a lot of detail – very impressive (Q25)\n.\nEMMA:\nWas that the article with the illustrations of early stages of plant development? They were very clear.\nJACK:\nI think those diagrams were in another article.\nEMMA:\nAnyway, shall we have a look at the procedure for our experiment? We’ll need to get going with it quite soon.\nJACK:\nRight. So the first thing we have to do is find our seeds. I think vegetable seeds would be best. And obviously they mustn’t all be the same size.\nSo how many sorts do we need? About four different ones (Q26)\n?\nEMMA:\nI think that would be enough. There’ll be quite a large number of seeds for each one.\nJACK:\nThen, for each seed we need to find out how much it weighs (Q27)\n, and also measure its dimensions, and we need to keep a careful record of all that.\nEMMA:\nThat’ll be quite time-consuming.\nAnd we also need to decide how deep we’re going to plant the seeds (Q28)\n– right on the surface, a few millimetres down, or several centimetres.\nJACK:\nOK. So then we get planting.\nDo you think we can plant several seeds together in the same plant pot?\nEMMA:\nNo, I think we need a different one for each seed (Q29)\n.\nJACK:\nRight. And we’ll need to label them – we can use different coloured labels. Then we wait for the seeds to germinate – I reckon that’ll be about three weeks, depending on what the weather’s like.\nThen we see if our plants have come up. and write down how tall they’ve grown (Q30)\n.\nEMMA:\nThen all we have to do is look at our numbers, and see if there’s any relation between them.\nJACK:\nThat’s right.

Today we’re going to be looking at animals in urban environments and I’m going to be telling you about some research on how they’re affected by these environments.\nNow, in evolutionary terms, urban environments represent huge upheavals, the sorts of massive changes that usually happen over millions of years. And we used to think that only a few species could adapt to this new environment. One species which is well known as being highly adaptable is the\ncrow (Q31)\n, and there’ve been various studies about how they manage to learn new skills. Another successful species is the pigeon, because they’re able to perch on ledges on the walls of city buildings, just like they once perched on\ncliffs (Q32)\nby the sea.\nBut in fact, we’re now finding that these early immigrants were just the start of a more general movement of animals into cities, and of adaptation by these animals to city life. And one thing that researchers are finding especially interesting is the\nspeed (Q33)\nwith which they’re doing this – we’re not talking about gradual evolution here – these animals are changing fast.\nLet me tell you about some of the studies that have been carried out in this area. So, in the University of Minnesota, a biologist called Emilie Snell-Rood and her colleagues looked at specimens of urbanised small mammals such as mice and gophers that had been collected in Minnesota, and that are now kept in museums there. And she looked at specimens that had been collected over the last hundred years, which is a very short time in evolutionary terms. And she found that during that time, these small mammals had experienced a jump in\nbrain (Q34)\nsize when compared to rural mammals. Now, we can’t be sure this means they’re more intelligent, but since the sizes of other parts of the body didn’t change, it does suggest that something cognitive was going on. And Snell-Rood thinks that this change might reflect the cognitive demands of adjusting to city life – having to look in different places to find\nfood (Q35)\n, for example, and coping with a whole new set of dangers.\nThen over in Germany at the Max Planck Institute, there’s another biologist called Catarina Miranda who’s done some experiments with blackbirds living in urban and rural areas. And she’s been looking not at their anatomy but at their\nbehaviour (Q36)\n. So as you might expect, she’s found that the urban blackbirds tend to be quite bold – they’re prepared to face up to a lot of threats that would frighten away their country counterparts. But there’s one type of situation that does seem to frighten the urban blackbirds, and that’s anything\nnew (Q37)\n– anything they haven’t experienced before. And if you think about it, that’s quite sensible for a bird living in the city.\nJonathan Atwell, in Indiana University, is looking at how a range of animals respond to urban environments. He’s found that when they’re under\nstress (Q38)\n, their endocrine systems react by reducing the amount of hormones such as corticosterone into their blood. It’s a sensible- seeming adaptation. A rat that gets scared every time a subway train rolls past won’t be very successful.\nThere’s just one more study I’d like to mention which is by Sarah Parian and her team, and they’ve been looking at how squirrels communicate in an urban environment, and they’ve found that a routine part of their communication is carried out by waving their\ntails (Q39)\n. You do also see this in the country, but it’s much more prevalent in cities, possibly because it’s effective in a noisy environment.\nSo what are the long-term implications of this? One possibility is that we may see completely new species developing in cities. But on the other hand, it’s possible that not all of these adaptations will be\npermanent (Q40)\n. Once the animal’s got accustomed to its new environment, it may no longer need the features it’s developed.\nSo, now we’ve had a look …\n剑桥雅思13 Test1 Section4雅思听力答案\n31. crow\n32. cliffs\n33. speed\n34. brain(s)\n35. food\n36. behaviour(s)/behavior(s)\n37. new\n38. stress\n39. tail(s)\n40. permanent"

Er… I want to find out about joining the club.\nJIM:\nRight. I can help you there. I’m the club secretary and my name’s Jim Hunter.\nWOMAN:\nOh, hi Jim.\nJIM:\nSo, are you interested in membership for yourself?\nWOMAN:\nThat’s right.\nJIM:\nOK. Well there are basically two types of adult membership. If you’re pretty serious about cycling, there’s the Full membership. That costs 260 dollars and that covers you not just for ordinary cycling but also for\nraces (Q1)\nboth here in the city and also in other parts of Australia.\nWOMAN:\nRight. Well, I’m not really up to that standard. I was more interested in just joining a group to do some cycling in my free time.\nJIM:\nSure. That’s why most people join. So, in that case you’d be better with the Recreational membership. That’s 108 dollars if you’re over 19, and 95 dollars if you’re under.\nWOMAN:\nI’m 25.\nJIM:\nOK. It’s paid quarterly, and you can upgrade it later to the Full membership if you want to, of course. Now both types of membership include the club fee of 20 dollars. They also provide\ninsurance (Q2)\nin case you have an accident, though we hope you won’t need that, of course.\nWOMAN:\nNo. OK, well, I’ll go with the Recreational membership, I think. And that allows me to join in the club activities, and so on?\nJIM:\nThat’s right. And once you’re a member of the club, you’re also permitted to wear our kit when you’re out cycling. It’s green and white.\nWOMAN:\nYes, I’ve seen cyclists wearing it. So, can I buy that at the club?\nJIM:\nNo, it’s made to order by a company in Brisbane. You can find them online: they’re called\nJerriz. That’s J-E-R-R-l-Z (Q3)\n. You can use your membership number to put in an order on their website.\nWOMAN:\nOK. Now, can you tell me a bit about the rides I can do?\nJIM:\nSure. So we have training rides pretty well every morning, and they’re a really good way of improving your cycling skills as well as your general level of fitness, but they’re different levels. Level A is pretty fast – you’re looking at about 30 or 35 kilometres an hour. If you can do about\n25 (Q4)\nkilometres an hour, you’d probably be level B, and then level C are the novices, who stay at about 15 kilometres per hour.\nWOMAN:\nRight. Well I reckon I’d be level B. So, when are the sessions for that level?\nJIM:\nThere are a couple each week. They’re both early morning sessions. There’s one on Tuesdays, and for that one you meet at 5.30 am. and the meeting point’s the\nstadium (Q5)\n– do you know where that is?\nWOMAN:\nYes, it’s quite near my home, in fact. OK, and how about the other one?\nJIM:\nThat’s on Thursdays. It starts at the same time, but they meet at the main gate to the\npark (Q6)\n.\nWOMAN:\nIs that the one just past the shopping mall?\nJIM:\nThat’s it.\nWOMAN:\nSo how long are the rides?\nJIM:\nThey’re about an hour and a half. So, if you have a job it’s easy to fit in before you go to work. And the members often ao somewhere for\ncoffee (Q7)\nafterwards, so it’s quite a social event.\nWOMAN:\nOK. That sounds good. I’ve only just moved to the city so I don’t actually know many people yet.\nJIM:\nWell, it’s a great way to meet people.\nWOMAN:\nAnd does each ride have a\nleader (Q8)\n?\nJIM:\nSometimes, but not always. But you don’t really need one; the group members on the ride support one another, anyway.\nWOMAN:\nHow would we know where to go?\nJIM:\nIf you check the club website, you’ll see that the\nroute\n(Q9)\nfor each ride is clearly marked. So you can just print that out and take it along with you. It’s similar from one week to another, but it’s not always exactly the same.\nWOMAN:\nAnd what do I need to bring?\nJIM:\nWell, bring a bottle of water, and your phone. You shouldn’t use it while you’re cycling, but have it with you.\nWOMAN:\nRight.\nJIM:\nAnd in winter, it’s well before sunrise when we set out, so you need to make sure your bike’s got\nlights (Q10)\n.\nWOMAN:\nThat’s OK. Well, thanks Jim. I’d definitely like to join. So what’s the best way of going about it?\nJIM: You can …\n剑桥雅思13 Test2 Section1雅思听力答案\n1. races\n2. insurance\n3.

They also provide\ninsurance\nin case you have an accident\n答案解析：同样是考察并列，这次原文用also来替换and，也是Section4十分常见的考察方式。\n第3题答案：Jerriz\n对应原文：You can find them online: they’re called\nJerriz. That’s J-E-R-R-l-Z\n答案解析：本来是毫无难度的姓名拼写，但录音中z的读音发生了改变，需要大家具有一定的临场应变能力。\n第4题答案：25/twenty-five\n对应原文：Level A is pretty fast – you’re looking at about 30 or 35 kilometres an hour.

It starts at the same time, but they meet at the main gate to the\npark\n答案解析：听到Thursdays意识到答案即将到来，跟上一题一样，空上应该填一个地点，因此锁定park。\n第7题答案：coffee\n对应原文： And the members often ao somewhere for\ncoffee\nafterwards, so it’s quite a social event.\n答案解析：这道题的难点主要在于没有明显的定位词，只能根据问答节奏来确定答案所在句子。不过原文中coffee读的偏重，而且也能从空前词have推测出空上应该填某种食物、饮料或娱乐方式，还算是给人留了一条活路。\n第8题答案：leader\n对应原文：And does each ride have a\nleader\n答案解析：采用他人更正的方式，由女性提出猜测，再有男性给予肯定。\n第9题答案：route\n对应原文： If you check the club website, you’ll see that the\nroute\nfor each ride is clearly marked\n答案解析：这道题很容易找到答案所在位置，但因为route一词在听力中不常出现，一些同学可能会反应不过来。\n第10题答案：lights\n对应原文：in winter, it’s well before sunrise when we set out, so you need to make sure your bike’s got\nlights\n答案解析：同样是定位很容易，但因为出现弱读现象，比较考验大家的听音辨音能力。"

OK, so this meeting is for new staff and staff who haven’t been involved with our volunteering projects yet. So basically, the idea is that we allow staff to give up some of their work time to help on various charity projects to benefit the local community. We’ve been doing this for the last five years and it’s been very successful.\nParticipating doesn’t necessarily involve a huge time commitment.\nThe company will pay for eight hours of your time (Q11)\n. That can be used over one or two days all at once, or spread over several months throughout the year. There are some staff who enjoy volunteering so much they also give up their own free time for a couple of hours every week. It’s completely up to you. Obviously, many people will have family commitments and aren’t as available as other members of staff.\nFeedback from staff has been overwhelmingly positive. Because they felt they were doing something really useful,\nnearly everyone agreed that volunteering made them feel more motivated at work (Q12)\n. They also liked building relationships with the people in the local community and felt valued by them. One or two people also said it was a good thing to have on their CVs.\nOne particularly successful project last year was the Get Working Project. This was aimed at helping unemployed people in the area get back to work.\nOur staff were able to help them improve their telephone skills, such as writing down messages and speaking with confidence to potential customers, which they had found quite difficult (Q13)\n. This is something many employers look for in job applicants – and something we all do without even thinking about, every day at work.\nWe’ve got an exciting new project starting this year. Up until now, we’ve mainly focused on projects to do with education and training. And we’ll continue with our reading project in schools and our work with local charities.\nBut we’ve also agreed to help out on a conservation project in Redfern Park (Q14)\n. So if any of you fancy being outside and getting your hands dirty, this is the project for you.\nI also want to mention the annual Digital Inclusion Day, which is coming up next month. The aim of this is to help older people keep up with technology.\nAnd this year, instead of hosting the event in our own training facility, we’re using the ICT suite at Hill College (Q15)\n, as it can hold far more people.\nWe’ve invited over 60 people from the Silver Age Community Centre to take part, so we’ll need a lot of volunteers to help with this event.\nIf you’re interested in taking part, please go to the volunteering section of our website and complete the relevant form (Q16)\n. We won’t be providing any training for this but you’ll be paired with an experienced volunteer if you’ve never done it before. By the way, don’t forget to tell your manager about any volunteering activities you decide to do.\nThe participants on the Digital Inclusion Day really benefited. The majority were in their seventies, though some were younger and a few were even in their nineties! Quite a few owned both a computer and a\nmobile phone, but these tended to be outdated models (Q17)\n. They generally knew how to do simple things, like send texts, but weren’t aware of recent developments in mobile phone technology.\nA few were keen to learn but most were quite dismissive at first – they couldn’t see the point of updating their skills (Q18)\n. But that soon changed.\nThe feedback was very positive. The really encouraging thing was that p\narticipants all said they felt much more confident about using social media to keep in touch with their grandchildren (Q19)\n, who prefer this form of communication to phoning or sending emails.\nA lot of them also said playing online games would help them make new friends and keep their brains active (Q20)\n. They weren’t that impressed with being able to order their groceries online, as they liked going out to the shops, but some said it would come in handy if they were ill or the weather was really bad. One thing they asked about was using tablets for things like reading newspapers – some people had been given tablets as presents but had never used them, so that’s something we’ll make sure we include this time …\n剑桥雅思13 Test2 Section2雅思听力答案\n11.

But that soon changed.\n答案解析：录音中提到，一些人一开始就很热情，但大多数不怎么感兴趣。但这一态度很快就改变了。E选项intially对应at first，little interest对应dismissive，由此锁定答案。\n第19题答案：B\n对应原文：Participants all said they felt much more confident about using social media to keep in touch with their grandchildren\n答案解析：这道题的答案出现的稍微有些突然，不过只要注意力足够集中，还是很容易识别出keep in touch与communication的同义替换，进而确定B为正确答案。\n第20题答案：D\n对应原文：A lot of them also said playing online games would help them make new friends and keep their brains active\n答案解析：原文提到，许多人也说，玩网络游戏帮助他们交到新朋友，保持大脑活跃，即认为玩网络游戏有用，由此确定D为正确答案。"

And I’m really struggling. I chose the topic because I didn’t know much about it and wanted to learn more, but now I’ve read so much about it, in a way there’s too much to say -I could talk for much longer than the twenty minutes I’ve been allocated.\nShould I assume the other students don’t know much, and give them a kind of general introduction, or should I try and make them share my fascination with a particular aspect (Q21)\n?\nTUTOR:\nYou could do either, but you’ll need to have it clear in your own mind.\nRUSS:\nThen I think I’ll give an overview.\nTUTOR:\nOK. Now, one way of approaching this is to work through developments in chronological order.\nRUSS:\nUh-huh.\nTUTOR:\nOn the other hand, you could talk about the numerous ways that nanotechnology is being applied.\nRUSS:\nYou mean things like thin films on camera displays to make them water-repellent, and additives to make motorcycle helmets stronger and lighter.\nTUTOR:\nExactly.\nOr another way would be to focus on its impact in one particular area, say medicine, or space exploration (Q22)\n.\nRUSS:\nThat would make it easier to focus. Perhaps I should do that.\nTUTOR:\nI think that would be a good idea.\nRUSS:\nRight, How important is it to include slides in the presentation?\nTUTOR:\nThey aren’t essential, by any means. And there’s a danger of tailoring what you say to fit whatever slides you can find.\nWhile it can be good to include slides, you could end up spending too long looking for suitable ones. You might find it better to leave them out (Q23)\n.\nRUSS:\nI see. Another thing I was wondering about was how to start. I know presentations often begin with ‘First I’m going to talk about this, and then I’ll talk about that’, but I thought about asking the audience what they know about nanotechnology.\nTUTOR:\nThat would be fine if you had an hour or two for the presentation, but you might find that you can’t do anything with the answers you get, and it simply eats into the short time that’s available.\nRUSS:\nSo,\nmaybe I should mention a particular way that nanotechnology is used, to focus people’s attention (Q24)\n.\nTUTOR:\nThat sounds sensible.\nRUSS:\nWhat do you think I should do next? I really have to plan the presentation today and tomorrow.\nTUTOR:\nWell, initially I think you should ignore all the notes you’ve made, take a small piece of paper, and\nwrite a single short sentence that ties together the whole presentation (Q25)\n: it can be something as simple as ‘Nanotechnology is already improving our lives’. Then start planning the content around that. You can always modify that sentence later, if you need to.\nRUSS:\nOK.\nTUTOR:\nOK, now let’s think about actually giving the presentation. You’ve only given one before, if I remember correctly, about an experiment you’d been involved in.\nRUSS:\nThat’s right. It was pretty rubbish!\nTUTOR:\nLet’s say it was better in some respects than in others.\nWith regard to the structure. I felt that you ended rather abruptly, without rounding it off (Q26)\n. Be careful not to do that in next week’s presentation.\nRUSS:\nOK.\nTUTOR:\nAnd\nyou made very little eve contact with the audience, because you were looking down at your notes most of the time. You need to be looking at the audience and only occasionally glancing at your notes (Q27)\n.\nRUSS:\nMmm.\nTUTOR:\nYour body language was a little odd. Every time you showed a slide, you turned your back on the audience so you could look at it – you should have been looking at your laptop. And you kept scratching your head, so\nI found myself wondering when you were next going to do that, instead of listening to what you were saying (Q28)\n!\nRUSS:\nOh dear. What did you think of the language? I knew that not everyone was familiar with the subject, so I tried to make it as simple as I could.\nTUTOR:\nYes, that came across.\nYou used a few words that are specific to the field, but you always explained what they meant, so the audience wouldn’t have had any difficulty understanding (Q29)\n.\nRUSS:\nUh-huh.\nTUTOR:\nI must say the handouts you prepared were well thought out. They were a good summary of your presentation (Q30)\n, which people would be able to refer to later on. So well done on that.\nRUSS:\nThank you.\nTUTOR:\nWell, I hope that helps you with next week’s presentation.\nRUSS:\nYes, it will. Thanks a lot.\nTUTOR:\nI’ll look forward to seeing a big improvement, then.\n剑桥雅思13 Test2 Section3雅思听力答案\n21. B\n22. A\n23. C\n24. C\n25. A\n26. A\n27. C\n28. D\n29. G\n30. B"

Episodic memories allow us to mentally travel back in time to an event from the past. Episodic memories include various details about these events, for example, when an event happened and other information such as the\nlocation (Q31)\n. To help understand this concept, try to remember the last time you ate dinner at a restaurant. The ability to remember where you ate, who you were with and the items you ordered are all features of an episodic memory.\nEpisodic memory is distinct from another type of memory called semantic memory. This is the type of factual memory that we have in common with everyone else – that is your general knowledge of the\nworld (Q32)\n. To build upon a previous example, remembering where you parked your car is an example of episodic memory, but your understanding of what a car is and how an engine works are examples of semantic memory. Unlike episodic memory, semantic memory isn’t dependent on recalling\npersonal (Q33)\nexperiences.\nEpisodic memory can be thought of as a process with several different steps of memory processing: encoding, consolidation and retrieval.\nThe initial step is called encoding. This involves the process of receiving and registering information, which is necessary for creating memories of information or events that you experience. The degree to which you can successfully encode information depends on the level of\nattention (Q34)\nyou give to an event while it’s actually happening. Being distracted can make effective encoding very difficult. Encoding of episodic memories is also influenced by how you process the event. For example, if you were introduced to someone called Charlie. you might make the connection that your uncle has the same\nname (Q35)\n. Future recollection of Charlie’s name is much easier if you have a strategy to help you encode it.\nMemory consolidation, the next step in forming an episodic memory, is the process by which memories of encoded information are strengthened, stabilised and stored to facilitate later retrieval. Consolidation is most effective when the information being stored can be linked to an existing\nnetwork (Q36)\nof information. Consolidation makes it possible for you to store memories for later retrieval indefinitely. Forming strong memories depends on the\nfrequency (Q37)\nwith which you try to retrieve them. Memories can fade or become harder to retrieve if they aren’t used very often.\nThe last step in forming episodic memories is called retrieval, which is the conscious recollection of encoded information. Retrieving information from episodic memory depends upon semantic, olfactory, auditory and visual factors. These help episodic memory retrieval by acting as a prompt. For example, when recalling where you parked your car you may use the\ncolour (Q38)\nof a sign close to where you parked. You actually have to mentally travel back to the moment you parked.\nThere are a wide range of neurological diseases and conditions that can affect episodic memory. These range from Alzheimer’s to schizophrenia to autism. An impairment of episodic memory can have a profound effect on individuals’ lives. For example, the symptoms of schizophrenia can be reasonably well controlled by medication; however, patients’ episodic memory may still be impaired and so they are often unable to return to university or work. Recent studies have shown that computer-assisted games designed to keep the\nbrain (Q39)\nactive can help improve their episodic memory.\nEpisodic memories can help people connect with others, for instance by sharing intimate details about their past: something individuals with autism often have problems with. This may be caused by an absence of a sense of\nself (Q40)\n. This is essential for the storage of episodic memory, and has been found to be impaired in children with autism. Research has shown that treatments that improve memory may also have a positive impact on children’s social development.\n剑桥雅思13 Test2 Section4雅思听力答案\n31. location\n32. world\n33. personal\n34. attention\n35. name\n36. network\n37. frequency\n38. colour/color\n39. brain\n40. self"

This is Matt Brooks. Alex White gave me your number. He said you’d be able to give me some advice about moving to Banford.\nLINDA:\nYes, Alex did mention you. How can I help?\nMATT:\nWell, first of all – which area to live in?\nLINDA:\nWell, I live in Dalton, which is a really nice suburb – not too expensive, and there’s a nice park. Example\nMATT:\nSounds good. Do you know how much it would be to rent a two bedroom flat there?\nLINDA:\nYeah, you should be able to get something reasonable for\n850 (Q1)\npounds per month. That’s what people typically pay. You certainly wouldn’t want to pay more than 900 pounds. That doesn’t include bills or anything.\nMATT:\nNo. That sounds alright. I’ll definitely have a look there. Are the transport links easy from where you live?\nLINDA:\nWell, I’m very lucky. I work in the city centre so I don’t have to use public transport. I go by\nbike (Q2)\n.\nMATT:\nOh, I wish I could do that. Is it safe to cycle around the city?\nLINDA:\nYes, it’s fine. And it keeps me fit. Anyway, driving to work in the city centre would be a nightmare because there’s hardly any\nparking\n(Q3)\n. And the traffic during the rush hour can be bad.\nMATT:\nI’d be working from home but I’d have to go to London one or two days a week.\nLINDA:\nOh, that’s perfect. Getting to London is no problem. There’s a fast train every\n30 (Q4)\nminutes which only takes 45 minutes.\nMATT:\nThat’s good.\nLINDA:\nYeah, the train service isn’t bad during the week. And they run quite late at night. It’s\nweekends (Q5)\nthat are a problem. They’re always doing engineering work and you have to take a bus to Hadham and pick up the train there, which is really slow. But other than that, Banford’s a great place to live. I’ve never been happier.\nLINDA:\nThere are some nice restaurants in the city centre and a brand new\ncinema (Q6)\nwhich has only been open a couple of months. There’s a good arts centre too. Q6\nMATT:\nSounds like Banford’s got it all.\nLINDA:\nYes! We’re really lucky. There are lots of really good aspects to living here. The schools are good and the\nhospital (Q7)\nhere is one of the best in the country. Everyone I know who’s been there’s had a positive experience. Oh, I can give you the name of my\ndentist (Q8)\ntoo in Bridge Street, if you’re interested. I’ve been going to him for years and I’ve never had any problems.\nMATT:\nOh, OK. Thanks!\nLINDA:\nI’ll find his number and send it to you.\nMATT:\nThanks, that would be really helpful.\nLINDA:\nAre you planning to visit Banford soon?\nMATT:\nYes. My wife and I are both coming next week. We want to make some appointments with estate agents.\nLINDA:\nI could meet you if you like and show you around.\nMATT:\nAre you sure? We’d really appreciate that.\nLINDA:\nEither a Tuesday or Thursday is good for me. after 5.30.\nMATT:\nThursday’s (Q9)\npreferable – Tuesday I need to get home before 6 pm.\nLINDA:\nOK. Great. Let me know which train you’re catching and I’ll meet you in the\ncafé (Q10)\noutside. You can’t miss it. It’s opposite the station and next to the museum. Q10\nMATT:\nBrilliant.

Many people are put off by the idea of having to fit a visit to the gym into their busy day – you often have to go very early or late as some gyms can get very crowded.\nBut with regular training you’ll see a big difference in a relatively short space of time (Q11)\n.\nRunning has become incredibly popular in recent years. That’s probably got a lot to do with the fact that\nit’s a very accessible form of exercise – anyone can run – even if you can only run a few metres to begin with\n(Q12)\n. But make sure you get the right shoes – it’s worth investing in a high quality pair and they don’t come cheap. Another great thing about running is that you can do it at any time of day or night – the only thing that may stop you is snow and ice.\nSwimming is another really good way to build fitness. What attracts many people is that\nyou can swim in an indoor pool at any time of year (Q13)\n. On the other hand, it can be quite boring or solitary – it’s hard to chat to people while you’re swimming lengths.\nCycling has become almost as popular as running in recent years. That’s probably because as well as improving their fitness,\nmany people say being out in the fresh air in a park or in the countryside can be fun (Q14)\n, provided the conditions are right, of course – only fanatics go out in the wind and rain!\nYoga is a good choice for those of you looking for exercise which focuses on developing both a healthy mind and body. It’s a good way of building strength and with the right instructor,\nthere’s less chance of hurting yourself than with other more active sports (Q15)\n. But don’t expect to find it easy – it can be surprisingly challenging, especially for people who aren’t very flexible.\nGetting a personal trainer is a good way to start your fitness programme. Obviously there can be significant costs involved.\nBut if you’ve got someone there to encourage you and help you achieve your goals, you’re less likely to give up (Q16)\n. Make sure you get someone with a recognised qualification, though, or you could do yourself permanent damage.\nWhatever you do, don’t join a gym unless you’re sure you’ll make good use of it. So many people waste lots of money by signing up for membership and then hardly ever go. What happens to their good intentions? I don’t think people suddenly stop caring about improving their fitness, or decide they have more important things to do.\nI think people lose interest when they don’t think they’re making enough progress (Q17)\n. That’s when they give up hope and stop believing they’ll ever achieve their goals. Also,\nwhat people sometimes don’t realise when they start is that it takes a lot of determination and hard work to keep training week after week (Q18)\nand lots of people don’t have that kind of commitment.\nOne thing you can do to help yourself is to set manageable goals –\nbe realistic and don’t push yourself too far (Q19)\n. Some people advise writing goals down, but I think it’s better to have a flexible approach.\nGive yourself a really nice treat every time you reach one of your goals (Q20)\n. And don’t get too upset if you experience setbacks – it’s a journey – there are bound to be difficulties along the way.\n剑桥雅思13 Test3 Section2雅思听力答案\n11. F\n12. D\n13. A\n14. B\n15. C\n16. G\n17-18.

You wanted to see me about your textile design project.\nJIM:\nThat’s right. I’ve been looking at how a range of natural dyes can be used to colour fabrics like cotton and wool.\nTUTOR:\nWhy did you choose that topic?\nJIM:\nWell, I got a lot of useful ideas from the museum, you know, at that exhibition of textiles. But I’ve always been interested in anything to do with colour.\nYears ago, I went to a carpet shop with my parents when we were on holiday in Turkey, and I remember all the amazing colours (Q21)\n.\nTUTOR:\nThey might not all have been natural dyes.\nJIM:\nMaybe not, but for the project I decided to follow it up. And I found a great book about a botanic garden in California that specialises in plants used for dyes.\nTUTOR:\nOK. So, in your project, you had to include a practical investigation.\nJIM:\nYeah. At first I couldn’t decide on my variables. I was going to just look at one type of fibre for example, like cotton …\nTUTOR:\n… and see how different types of dyes affected it?\nJIM:\nYes.\nThen I decided to include others as well, so I looked at cotton and wool and nylon (Q22)\n.\nTUTOR:\nWith just one type of dye?\nJIM:\nVarious types, including some that weren’t natural, for comparison.\nTUTOR:\nOK.\nJIM:\nSo, I did the experiments last week. I used some ready-made natural dyes, I found a website which supplied them, they came in just a few days, but I also made some of my own.\nTUTOR:\nThat must have taken quite a bit of time.\nJIM:\nYes, I’d thought it’d just be a matter of a teaspoon or so of dye, and actually that wasn’t the case at all.\nLike I was using one vegetable, beetroot, for a red dye, and I had to chop up a whole pile of it (Q23)\n. So it all took longer than I’d expected.\nTUTOR:\nOne possibility is to use food colourings.\nJIM:\nI did use one. That was a yellow dye, an artificial one.\nTUTOR:\nTartrazine?\nJIM:\nYeah. I used it on cotton first. It came out a great colour,\nbut when I rinsed the material, the colour just washed away (Q24)\n. I’d been going to try it out on nylon, but I abandoned that idea.\nTUTOR:\nWere you worried about health issues?\nJIM:\nI’d thought if it’s a legal food colouring, it must be safe.\nTUTOR:\nWell, it can occasionally cause allergic reactions, I believe.\nTUTOR:\nSo what natural dyes did you look at?\nJIM:\nWell, one was turmeric. The colour’s great, it’s a really strong yellow. It’s generally used in dishes like curry.\nTUTOR:\nIt’s meant to be quite good for your health when eaten, but you might find\nit’s not permanent when it’s used as a dye – a few washes, and it’s gone (Q25)\n.\nJIM:\nRight. I used beetroot as a dye for wool. When I chop up beetroot to eat I always end up with bright red hands,\nbut the wool ended up just a sort of watery cream shade (Q26)\n. Disappointing.\nTUTOR:\nThere’s a natural dye called Tyrian purple. Have you heard of that?\nJIM:\nYes. It comes from a shellfish, and it was worn in ancient times but only by important people as\nit was so rare. I didn’t use it.\nTUTOR:\nIt fell out of use centuries ago (Q27)\n. though one researcher managed to get hold of some recently. But that shade of purple can be produced by chemical dyes nowadays. Did you use any black dyes?\nJIM:\nLogwood. That was quite complicated. I had to prepare the fabric so the dye would take.\nTUTOR:\nI hope you were careful to wear gloves.\nJIM:\nYes. I know the danger with that dye.\nTUTOR:\nGood.\nIt can be extremely dangerous if it’s ingested (Q28)\n. Now, presumably you had a look at an insect-based dye? Like cochineal, for example?\nJIM:\nYes. I didn’t actually make that, I didn’t have time to start crushing up insects to get the red colour and anyway they’re not available here, but I managed to get the dye quite easily from a website.\nBut it cost a fortune (Q29)\n. I can see why it’s generally just used in cooking, and in small quantities.\nTUTOR:\nYes, it’s very effective, but that’s precisely why it’s not used as a dye.\nJIM:\nI also read about using metal oxide. Apparently you can allow iron to rust while it’s in contact with the fabric, and that colours it.\nTUTOR:\nYes, that works well for dying cotton. But you have to be careful as\nthe metal can actually affect the fabric (Q30)\nand so you can’t expect to get a lot of wear out of fabrics treated in this way. And the colours are quite subtle, not everyone likes them. Anyway, it looks as if you’ve done a lot of work …\n剑桥雅思13 Test3 Section3雅思听力答案\n21. C\n22. A\n23. A\n24. B\n25. C\n26. F\n27. H\n28. D\n29.

Today, I’d like us to have a look at another reptile – the lizard – and in particular, at some studies that have been done on a particular type of lizard whose Latin name is tiliqua rugosa. This is commonly known as the sleepy lizard, because it’s quite slow in its movements and spends quite a lot of its time dozing under rocks or lying in the sun.\nI’ll start with a general description. Sleepy lizards live in Western and South Australia, where they’re quite common. Unlike European lizards, which are mostly small, green and fast-moving, sleepy lizards are brown, but what’s particularly distinctive about them is the colour of their\ntongue (Q31)\n, which is dark blue, in contrast with the lining of their mouth which is bright pink. And they’re much bigger than most European lizards. They have quite a varied diet, including insects and even small animals, but they mostly eat\nplants (Q32)\nof varying kinds.\nEven though they’re quite large and powerful, with strong jaws that can crush beetles and snail shells, they still have quite a few predators. Large birds like cassowaries were one of the main ones in the past, but nowadays they’re more likely to be caught and killed by\nsnakes (Q33)\n. Actually, another threat to their survival isn’t a predator at all, but is man-made – quite a large number of sleepy lizards are killed by cars when they’re trying to cross highways.\nOne study carried out by Michael Freake at Flinders University investigated the methods of navigation of these lizards. Though they move slowly, they can travel quite long distances. And he found that even if they were taken some distance away from their home territory, they could usually find their way back home as long as they could see the\nsky (Q34)\n– they didn’t need any other landmarks on the around.\nObservations of these lizards in the wild have also revealed that their mating habits are quite unusual. Unlike most animals, it seems that they’re relatively monogamous, returning to the same\npartner (Q35)\nyear after year. And the male and female also stay together for a long time, both before and after the birth of their young.\nIt’s quite interesting to think about the possible reasons for this. It could be that it’s to do with protecting their young – you’d expect them to have a much better chance of survival if they have both parents around. But in fact observers have noted that once the babies have hatched out of their eggs, they have hardly any\ncontact (Q36)\nwith their parents. So, there’s not really any evidence to support that idea.\nAnother suggestion’s based on the observation that male lizards in monogamous relationships tend to be bigger and stronger than other males. So maybe the male lizards stay around so they can give the female lizards\nprotection (Q37)\nfrom other males. But again, we’re not really sure.\nFinally, I’d like to mention another study that involved collecting data by tracking the lizards. I was actually involved in this myself. So we caught some lizards in the wild and we developed a tiny GPS system that would allow us to track them, and we fixed this onto their\ntails (Q38)\n. Then we set the lizards free again, and we were able to track them for twelve days and gather data, not just about their location, but even about how many\nsteps (Q39)\nthey took during this period.\nOne surprising thing we discovered from this is that there were far fewer meetings between lizards than we expected – it seems that they were actually trying to avoid one another. So why would that be? Well, again we have no clear evidence, but one hypothesis is that male lizards can cause quite serious\ninjuries (Q40)\nto one another, so maybe this avoidance is a way of preventing this – of self-preservation if you like. But we need to collect a lot more data before we can be sure of any of this.\n剑桥雅思13 Test3 Section4雅思听力答案\n31. tongue(s)\n32. plants\n33. snakes\n34. sky\n35. partner(s)\n36. contact\n37. protection\n38. tail(s)\n39. steps\n40. injury/injuries"

It’s Martha Clines here. James White gave me your number. I hope you don’t mind me calling you.\nALEX:\nOf course not. How are you, Martha?\nMARTHA:\nGood thanks. I’m ringing because I need a bit of advice.\nALEX:\nOh yeah. What about?\nMARTHA:\nThe training you did at JPNW a few years ago. I’m applying for the same thing.\nALEX:\nOh right. Yes, I did mine in 2014. Best thing I ever did. I’m still working there. Example\nMARTHA:\nReally? What are you doing?\nALEX:\nWell, now I work in the customer services department but I did my initial training in\nFinance (Q1)\n. I stayed there for the first two years and then moved to where I am now.\nMARTHA:\nThat’s the same department I’m applying for. Did you enjoy it?\nALEX:\nI was pretty nervous to begin with. I didn’t do well in my exams at school and I was really worried because I failed\nMaths (Q2)\n. But it didn’t actually matter because I did lots of courses on the job.\nMARTHA:\nDid you get a diploma at the end of your trainee period? I’m hoping to do the one in\nbusiness (Q3)\nskills.\nALEX:\nYes. That sounds good. I took the one on IT skills but I wish I’d done that one instead.\nMARTHA:\nOK, that’s good to know. What about the other trainees? How did you get on with them?\nALEX:\nThere were about 20 of us who started at the same time and we were all around the same age -I was 18 and there was only one person younger than me. who was\n17 (Q4)\n. The rest were between 18 and 20. I made some good friends.\nMARTHA:\nI’ve heard lots of good things about the training at JPNW. It seems like there are a lot of opportunities there.\nALEX:\nYeah, definitely. Because of its size you can work in loads of different areas within the organisation.\nMARTHA:\nWhat about pay? I know you get a lower minimum wage than regular employees.\nALEX:\nThat’s right – which isn’t great. But you get the same number of days’\nholiday (Q5)\nas everyone else. And the pay goes up massively if they offer you a job at the end of the training period.\nMARTHA:\nYeah, but I’m not doing it for the money – it’s the experience I think will be really useful. Everyone says by the end of the year you gain so much confidence.\nALEX:\nYou’re right. That’s the most useful part about it. There’s a lot of variety too. You’re given lots of different things to do. I enjoyed it all – I didn’t even mind the studying.\nMARTHA:\nDo you have to spend any time in\ncollege (Q6)\n?\nALEX:\nYes, one day each month. So you get lots of support from both your tutor and your manager.\nMARTHA:\nThat’s good. And the company is easy to get to, isn’t it?\nALEX:\nYes, it’s very close to the train station so the\nlocation’s (Q7)\na real advantage.\nALEX:\nHave you got a date for your interview yet?\nMARTHA:\nYes, it’s on the 23rd of this month.\nALEX:\nSo long as you’re well prepared there’s nothing to worry about. Everyone’s very friendly.\nMARTHA:\nI am not sure what I should wear. What do you think?\nALEX:\nNothing too casual – like\njeans (Q8)\n, for example. If you’ve got a nice jacket, wear that with a skirt or trousers.\nMARTHA:\nOK. Thanks. Any other tips?\nALEX:\nErm, well I know it’s really obvious but arrive in plenty of time. They hate people who are\nlate (Q9)\n. So make sure you know exactly where you have to get to. And one other useful piece of advice my manager told me before I had the interview for this job – is to\nsmile (Q10)\n. Even if you feel terrified. It makes people respond better to you.\nMARTHA:\nI’ll have to practise doing that in the mirror!\nALEX:\nYeah – well, good luck. Let me know if you need any more information.\nMARTHA:\nThanks very much.\n剑桥雅思13 Test4 Section1雅思听力答案\n1. Finance\n2.

I’m hoping to do the one in\nbusiness\nskills.\n答案解析：录音中表示，Alex希望拿到商业技能方面的证书。题干中只是用虚拟语气替换了I am hoping这一说法，再加上skills原词出现，很容易锁定business。\n第4题答案：17/seventeen\n对应原文：I was 18 and there was only one person younger than me. who was\n17\n答案解析：录音中设置了18这一个干扰项，但因为题干中问的是youngest，因此排除18，选17。\n第5题答案：holiday(s)/vacation(s)\n对应原文：But you get the same number of days’\nholiday\nas everyone else\n答案解析：根据问答节奏定位到这句话，same原词出现，amount被替换成number，整体结构没有任何变化，由修饰关系确定答案为holiday。\n第6题答案：college\n对应原文：\nMARTHA:\nDo you have to spend any time in\ncollege\n?\nALEX:\nYes, one day each month.\n答案解析：Martha先给出建议，然后Alex再给予肯定，并提到题干中的提示词。这种题目在剑10之后越来越常见，以考察大家的短期记忆能力为主。\n第7题答案：location\n对应原文：Yes, it’s very close to the train station so the\nlocation’s\na real advantage.\n答案解析：录音中提到，公司离火车站很近，所以位置算是个优势。题干用convenient替换real advantage，由此锁定location。\n第8题答案：jeans\n对应原文：Nothing too casual – like\njeans\n, for example.\n答案解析：从题干可以推测空上应该填某种衣物，而且是否定的。虽然后面也提到了jacket, skirt和trousers，但这些都是推荐衣物，只有jeans符合要求。\n第9题答案：late\n对应原文：well I know it’s really obvious but arrive in plenty of time. They hate people who are\nlate\n答案解析：录音中提到，他们很讨厌人迟到。即不要迟到，因此锁定late为正确答案。\n第10题答案：smile\n对应原文：And one other useful piece of advice my manager told me before I had the interview for this job – is to\nsmile\n答案解析：另外一项有用的建议是要微笑，由此确定smile为正确答案。"

My name’s Annie. I hope you enjoyed the bus trip from the airport – we’ve certainly got plenty of snow today! Well, you’ve come to New Zealand’s premier snow and ski centre, and we’ve a whole load of activities for you during your week here.\nMost visitors come here for the cross-country skiing, where you’re on fairly flat ground for most of the time, rather than going down steep mountainsides.\nThere are marked trails, but you can also leave these and go off on your own and that’s an experience not to be missed (Q11)\n. You can go at your own speed – it’s great aerobic exercise if you really push yourself, or if you prefer you can just glide gently along and enjoy the beautiful scenery.\nThis afternoon, you’ll be going on a dog-sled trip. You may have seen our dogs on TV recently racing in the winter sled festival.\nIf you want, you can have your own team for the afternoon and learn how to drive them (Q12)\n, following behind our leader on the trail. Or if you’d prefer, you can just sit back in the sled and enjoy the ride as a passenger.\nAt the weekend, we have the team relay event, and you’re all welcome to join in. We have a local school coming along, and a lot of the teachers are taking part too. Participation rather than winning is the main focus, and\nthere’s a medal for everyone who takes part (Q13)\n. Participants are in teams of two to four, and each team must complete four laps of the course.\nFor your final expedition, you’ll head off to Mount Frenner wearing a pair of special snow shoes which allow you to walk on top of the snow. This is an areawhere miners once searched for gold, though there are very few traces of their work left now. When the snow melts in summer, the mountain slopes are carpeted in flowers and plants.\nIt’s a long ascent. though not too steep, and walkers generally take a couple of days to get to the summit and return (Q14)\n.\nYou’ll spend the night in our hut half-way up the mountain. That’s included in your package for the stay.\nIt’s got cooking facilities, firewood and water for drinking (Q15)\n. For washing, we recommend you use melted snow, though, to conserve supplies. We can take your luggage up on our snowmobile for you for just ten dollars a person. The hut has cooking facilities so you can make a hot meal in the evening and morning, but you need to take your own food.\nThe weather on Mount Frenner can be very stormy.\nIn that case, stay in the hut – generally the storms don’t last long (Q16)\n. Don’t stress about getting back here to the centre in time to catch the airport bus – they’ll probably not be running anyway. We do have an emergency locator beacon in the hut but only use that if it’s a real emergency, like if someone’s ill or injured.\nNow, let me tell you something about the different ski trails you can follow during your stay here. Highland Trail’s directly accessible from where we are now.\nThis trail’s been designed to give first-timers an experience they’ll enjoy regardless of their age or skill, but it’s also ideal for experts to practise their technique (Q17)\n.\nThen there’s Pine Trail… if you’re nervous about skiing, leave this one to the experts! You follow a steep valley looking right down on the river below – scary!\nBut if you’ve fully mastered the techniques needed for hills, it’s great fun (Q18)\n.\nStony Trail’s a good choice once you’ve got a general idea of the basics. There are one or two tricky sections, but nothing too challenging.\nThere’s a shelter half-way where you can sit and take a break and enjoy the afternoon sunshine (Q19)\n.\nAnd finally, Loser’s Trail. This starts off following a gentle river valley but the last part is quite exposed so the snow conditions can be challenging – if it’s snowing or windy,\ncheck with us before you set out to make sure the trail’s open that day (Q20)\n.\nRight, so now if you’d like to follow me, we’ll get started …\n剑桥雅思13 Test4 Section2雅思听力答案\n11.

What did you learn from doing the project about your own shopping habits?\nJACK:\nWell, I’ve always had to check labels for traces of peanuts in everything I eat because of my allergy. But beyond that\nI’ve never really been concerned enough to check how healthy a product is (Q21)\n.\nALICE:\nThis project has actually taught me to read the labels much more carefully.\nI tended to believe claims on packaging like ‘low in fat’. But I now realise that the ‘healthy’ yoghurt I’ve bought for years is full of sugar and that it’s actually quite high in calories (Q22)\n.\nJACK:\nReady meals are the worst… comparing the labels on supermarket pizzas was a real eye-opener. Did you have any idea how many calories they contain? I was amazed.\nALICE:\nYes, because\nunless you read the label really carefully, you wouldn’t know that the nutritional values given are for half a pizza (Q23)\n.\nJACK:\nWhen most people eat the whole pizza. Not exactly transparent is it?\nALICE:\nNot at all. But I expect it won’t stop you from buying pizza?\nJACK:\nProbably not, no! I thought comparing the different labelling systems used by food manufacturers was interesting. I think the kind of labelling system used makes a big difference.\nALICE:\nWhich one did you prefer?\nJACK:\nI liked the traditional daily value system best – the one which tells you what proportion of your required daily intake of each ingredient the product contains.\nI’m not sure it’s the easiest for people to use but at least you get the full story (Q24)\n. I like to know all the ingredients in a product – not just how much fat, salt and sugar they contain.\nALICE:\nBut it’s good supermarkets have been making an effort to provide reliable information for customers.\nJACK:\nYes. There just needs to be more consistency between labelling systems used by different supermarkets, in terms of portion sizes, etc.\nALICE:\nMmm. The labels on the different brands of chicken flavour crisps were quite revealing too, weren’t they?\nJACK:\nYeah.\nI don’t understand how they can get away with calling them chicken flavour when they only contain artificial additives\n.\nALICE:\nI know.\nI’d at least have expected them to contain a small percentage of real chicken (Q25)\n.\nJACK:\nAbsolutely.\nALICE:\nI think having nutritional food labeling has been a good idea, don’t you? I think it will change people’s behaviour and stop mothers, in particular, buying the wrong things.\nJACK:\nBut didn’t that study kind of prove the opposite? People didn’t necessarily stop buying unhealthy products.\nALICE:\nThey only said that might be the case.\nThose findings weren’t that conclusive (Q26)\nand it was quite a small-scale study. I think more research has to be done.\nJACK:\nYes, I think you’re probably right.\nJACK:\nWhat do you think of the traffic-light system?\nALICE:\nI think supermarkets like the idea of having a colour-coded system – red, orange or green – for levels of fat, sugar and salt in a product.\nJACK:\nBut it’s not been adopted universally\n. And not on all products. Why do you suppose that is?\nALICE:\nPressure from the food manufacturers. Hardly surprising that some of them are opposed to flagging up how unhealthy their products are.\nJACK:\nI’d have thought it would have been compulsory. It seems ridiculous it isn’t (Q27)\n.\nALICE:\nI know.\nAnd what I couldn’t get over is the fact that it was brought in without enough consultation (Q28)\n– a lot of experts had deep reservations about it.\nJACK:\nThat is a bit weird. I suppose there’s an argument for doing the research now when consumers are familiar with this system.\nALICE:\nYeah, maybe.\nJACK:\nThe participants in the survey were quite positive about the traffic-light system.\nALICE:\nMmm. But I don’t think they targeted the right people. They should have focused on people with low literacy levels because these labels are designed to be accessible to them.\nJACK:\nYeah.\nBut it’s good to get feedback from all socio-economic groups (Q29)\n. And there wasn’t much variation in their responses.\nALICE:\nNo. But\nif they hadn’t interviewed participants face-to-face, they could have used a much bigger sample size (Q30)\n. I wonder why they chose that method?\nJACK:\nDunno. How were they selected? Did they volunteer or were they approached?\nALICE:\nI think they volunteered. The thing that wasn’t stated was how often they bought packaged food – all we know is how frequently they used the supermarket.\n剑桥雅思13 Test4 Section3雅思听力答案\n21. A\n22. A\n23. C\n24. C\n25. B\n26.

We think it was first drunk in the Arab world, but there’s hardly any documentary evidence of it before the 1500s, although of course that doesn’t mean that people didn’t know about it before then.\nHowever, there is evidence that coffee was originally gathered from bushes growing wild in Ethiopia, in the northeast of Africa. In the early sixteenth century, it was being bought by traders, and gradually its use as a drink spread throughout the Middle East. It’s also known that in 1522, in the Turkish city of Constantinople, which was the centre of the Ottoman Empire, the court physician approved its use as a medicine.\nBy the mid-1500s, coffee bushes were being cultivated in the Yemen and for the next hundred years this region produced most of the coffee drunk in Africa and the Arab world.\nWhat’s particularly interesting about coffee is its effect on social life. It was rarely drunk at home, but instead people went to coffee houses to drink it. These people, usually men, would meet to drink coffee and chat about issues of the day. But at the time, this chance to share ideas and opinions was seen as something that was potentially dangerous, and in 1623 the ruler of Constantinople demanded the\ndestruction (Q31)\nof all the coffee houses in the city. although after his death many new ones opened, and coffee consumption continued. In the seventeenth century, coffee drinking spread to Europe, and here too coffee shops became places where ordinary people, nearly always men, could meet to exchange ideas. Because of this, some people said that these places performed a similar function to\nuniversities (Q32)\n. The opportunity they provided for people to meet together outside their own homes and to discuss the topics of the day had an enormous impact on social life, and many social movements and\npolitical (Q33)\ndevelopments had their origins in coffee house discussions.\nIn the late 1600s, the Yemeni monopoly on coffee production broke down and coffee production started to spread around the world, helped by European colonisation. Europeans set up coffee plantations in Indonesia and the Caribbean and production of coffee in the colonies skyrocketed. Different types of coffee were produced in different areas, and it’s interesting that the names given to these different types, like Mocha or Java coffee, were often taken from the\nport (Q34)\nthey were shipped to Europe from. But if you look at the labour system in the different colonies, there were some significant differences.\nIn Brazil and the various Caribbean colonies, coffee was grown in huge plantations and the workers there were almost all\nslaves (Q35)\n. But this wasn’t the same in all colonies; for example in Java, which had been colonised by the Dutch, the peasants grew coffee and passed a proportion of this on to the Dutch, so it was used as a means of\ntaxation (Q36)\n. But whatever system was used, under the European powers of the eighteenth century, coffee production was very closely linked to colonisation. Coffee was grown in ever-increasing quantities to satisfy the growing demand from Europe, and it became nearly as important as\nsugar (Q37)\nproduction, which was grown under very similar conditions. However, coffee prices were not yet low enough for people to drink it regularly at home, so most coffee consumption still took place in public coffee houses and it still remained something of a luxury item. In Britain, however, a new drink was introduced from China, and started to become popular, gradually taking over from coffee, although at first it was so expensive that only the upper classes could afford it. This was\ntea (Q38)\n, and by the late 1700s it was being widely drunk. However, when the USA gained independence from Britain in 1776. they identified this drink with Britain, and coffee remained the preferred drink in the USA, as it still is today.\nSo, by the early nineteenth century, coffee was already being widely produced and consumed. But during this century, production boomed and coffee prices started to fall. This was partly because new types of\ntransportation (Q39)\nhad been developed which were cheaper and more efficient. So now, working people could afford to buy coffee – it wasn’t just a drink for the middle classes. And this was at a time when large parts of Europe were starting to work in industries. And sometimes this meant their work didn’t stop when it got dark: they might have to continue throughout the\nnight (Q40)\n. So, the use of coffee as a stimulant became important – it wasn’t just a drink people drank in the morning, for breakfast.\nThere were also changes in cultivation ……\n剑桥雅思13 Test4 Section4雅思听力答案\n31. destruction\n32. universities/university\n33. political\n34. port(s)\n35. slaves/slavery\n36. taxation\n37. sugar\n38. tea\n39. transportation\n40. night"

What can I do for you?\nLOUISE:\nI want to report a theft. I had some things stolen out of my bag yesterday.\nOFFICER:\nI’m sorry to hear that. Right, so I’ll need to take a few details. Can I start with your name?\nLOUISE:\nLouise Taylor.\nOFFICER:\nOK, thank you. And are you resident in the UK?\nLOUISE:\nNo, I’m actually\nCanadian (Q1)\n, though my mother was British.\nOFFICER:\nAnd your date of birth?\nLOUISE:\nDecember 14th, 1977.\nOFFICER:\nSo you’re just visiting this country?\nLOUISE:\nThat’s right. I come over most summers on business. I’m an interior designer and I come over to buy old\nfurniture (Q2)\n, antiques you know. There are some really lovely things around here, but you need to get out to the small towns. I’ve had a really good trip this year, until this happened.\nOFFICER:\nOK. So you’ve been here quite a while?\nLOUISE:\nYes, I’m here for two months. I go back next week.\nOFFICER:\nSo may I ask where you’re staying now?\nLOUISE:\nWell at present I’ve got a place at\nPark (Q3)\nApartments, that’s on King Street. I was staying at the Riverside Apartments on the same street, but the apartment there was only available for six weeks so I had to find another one.\nOFFICER:\nOK. And the apartment number?\nLOUISE:\nFifteen.\nLOUISE:\nRight.\nOFFICER:\nNow, I need to take some details of the theft. So you said you had some things stolen out of your bag?\nLOUISE:\nThat’s right.\nOFFICER:\nAnd were you actually carrying the bag when the theft took place?\nLOUISE:\nYes. I really can’t understand it. I had my backpack on. And I went into a supermarket to buy a few things and when I opened it up my wallet wasn’t there.\nOFFICER:\nAnd what did your wallet have in it?\nLOUISE:\nWell, fortunately I don’t keep my credit cards in that wallet – I keep them with my passport in an inside compartment in my backpack. But there was quite a bit of cash there … about £\n250 (Q4)\nsterling, I should think. I withdrew £300 from my account yesterday, but I did a bit of shopping, so I must have already spent about £50 of that.\nOFFICER:\nOK.\nLOUISE:\nAt first I thought, oh I must have left the wallet back in the apartment, but then I realised my\nphone (Q5)\nhad gone as well. It was only a week old, and that’s when I realised I’d been robbed. Anyway at least they didn’t take the keys to my rental car.\nOFFICER:\nYes. So you say the theft occurred yesterday?\nLOUISE:\nYes.\nOFFICER:\nSo that was\nSeptember the tenth (Q6)\n. And do you have any idea at all of where or when the things might possibly have been stolen?\nLOUISE:\nWell at first I couldn’t believe it because the bag had been on my back ever since I left the apartment after lunch. It’s just a small backpack, but I generally use it when I’m travelling because it seems safer than a handbag. Anyway, I met up with a friend, and we spent a couple of hours in the\nmuseum (Q7)\n. But I do remember that as we were leaving there, at about 4 o’clock, a group of young boys ran up to us, and they were really crowding round us, and they were asking us what\ntime (Q8)\nit was, then all of a sudden they ran off.\nOFFICER:\nCan you remember anything about them?\nLOUISE:\nThe one who did most of the talking was wearing a T-shirt with a picture of something … let’s see … a tiger.\nOFFICER:\nRight. Any idea of how old he might have been?\nLOUISE:\nAround twelve years old?\nOFFICER:\nAnd can you remember anything else about his appearance?\nLOUISE:\nNot much. He was quite thin …\nOFFICER:\nColour of hair?\nLOUISE:\nI do remember that – he was\nblond (Q9)\n. All the others were dark-haired.\nOFFICER:\nAnd any details of the others?\nLOUISE:\nNot really. They came and went so quickly.\nOFFICER:\nRight. So what I’m going to do now is give you a crime reference number so you can contact your insurance company. So this is ten digits:\n87954 82361 (Q10)\n.\nLOUISE:\nThank you. So should I…\n剑桥雅思14 Test1 Section1雅思听力答案\n1.

My name’s Janet Parker and I’m the human resources manager. We’re very happy to welcome you to your new apprenticeship. I hope that the next six months will be a positive and enjoyable experience for you.\nI’d like to start with some general advice about being an apprentice. Most of you have very little or no experience of working for a big organisation and the first week or so may be quite challenging. There will be a lot of new information to take in but don’t worry too much about trying to remember everything. The important thing is to\ncheck with someone if you’re not sure what to do (Q11)\n– you’ll find your supervisor is very approachable and won’t mind explaining things or helping you out. You’re here to learn so make the most of that opportunity. You’ll be spending time in different departments during your first week so make an effort to\ntalk to as many people as possible (Q12)\nabout their work – you’ll make some new friends and find out lots of useful information.\nAs well as having a supervisor, you’ll each be assigned a mentor. This person will be someone who’s recently completed an apprenticeship and you’ll meet with them on a weekly basis. Their role is to provide help and support throughout your apprenticeship. Of course, this doesn’t mean they’ll actually do any of your work for you – instead they’ll be asking you about\nwhat goals you’ve achieved so far (Q13)\n, as well as helping you to\nidentify any areas for improvement. You can also\ndiscuss your more long-term ambitions (Q14)\nwith them as well.\nNow I just want to run through a few company policies for our apprenticeship scheme with you… Most importantly, the internet. As part of your job you’ll be doing some research online so obviously you’ll have unlimited access for that but please\ndon’t use it for personal use (Q15)\n– you’ll have your own phones for that.\nSome of you have already asked me about flexible working. After your probationary three – month period – some of you will be eligible for this – but i\nt will depend on which department you’re in and what your personal circumstances are (Q16)\n. So please don’t assume you’ll automatically be permitted to do this.\nI want to make sure there’s no confusion about our holiday policy. Apart from any statutory public holidays\nwe ask that you don’t book any holidays until after your six-month apprenticeship has finished (Q17)\n. Time off should only be taken if you are unwell. Please speak to your supervisor if this is going to be a problem.\nYou’ll be expected to work a 40-hour week but there may be opportunities to do overtime during busy periods. Although you’re not required to do this,\nit can be a valuable experience – so we advise you to take it up if possible (Q18)\n. Obviously, we understand that people do have commitments outside work, so don’t worry if there are times when you are unavailable.\nAs you know, we don’t have a formal dress code here – you may wear casual clothes as long as they’re practical – and the only restriction for shoes we have Is on high heels for health and safety reasons.\nComfortable shoes like trainers are preferable (Q19)\n.\nThere’s a heavily subsidised canteen on site where you can get hot meals or salads cheaply. Snacks and drinks are also provided – so\nwe’ve decided to introduce a no packed lunch policy (Q20)\n. This is partly to encourage healthy eating at work and partly to stop people from eating at their workstation, which is unhygienic.\nOK moving on to …\n剑桥雅思14 Test1 Section2雅思听力答案\n11-12. AC\n13-14.

You should have done most of the reading now, so I’d like you to share your ideas, and talk about the structure of your presentation and what you need to do next.\nCARLA:\nOK Rob. I’m glad we chose quite a specific topic – cities built next to the sea. It made it much easier to find relevant information.\nROB:\nYeah. And cities are growing so quickly – I mean, we know that more than half the world’s population lives in cities now.\nCARLA:\nYeah, though that’s all cities, not just ones on the coast. But\nmost of the biggest cities are actually built by the sea (Q21)\n, I’d not realised that before.\nROB:\nNor me. And what’s more, a lot of them are built at places where rivers come out into the sea. But apparently this can be a problem.\nCARLA:\nWhy?\nROB:\nWell, as the city expands, agriculture and industry tend to spread further inland along the rivers, and so agriculture moves even further inland up the river. That’s not necessarily a problem, except it means\nmore and more pollutants are discharged into the rivers (Q22)\n.\nCARLA:\nSo these are brought downstream to the cities?\nROB:\nRight. Hmm. Did you read that article about Miami, on the east coast of the USA?\nCARLA:\nNO.\nROB:\nWell, apparently back in the 1950s they built channels to drain away the water in case of flooding.\nCARLA:\nSounds sensible.\nROB:\nYeah, they spent quite a lot of money on them.\nBut what they didn’t take into account was global warming (Q23)\n. So they built the drainage channels too close to sea level, and now sea levels are rising, they’re more or less useless. If there’s a lot of rain, the water can’t run away, there’s nowhere for it to go. The whole design was faulty.\nCARLA:\nSo what are the authorities doing about it now?\nROB:\nI don’t know. I did read that they’re aiming to stop disposing of waste water into the ocean over the next ten years.\nCARLA:\nBut that won’t help with flood prevention now, will it?\nROB:\nNo.\nReally they just need to find the money for something to replace the drainage channels (Q24\n), in order to protect against flooding now. But in the long term they need to consider the whole ecosystem.\nCARLA:\nRight. Really, though, coastal cities can’t deal with their problems on their own, can they? I mean, they’ve got to start acting together at an international level instead of just doing their own thing.\nROB:\nAbsolutely. The thing is, everyone knows what the problems are and environmentalists have a pretty good idea of what we should be doing about them,\nso they should be able to work together (Q25)\nto some extent. But it’s going to be a long time before countries come to a decision on what principles they’re prepared to abide by.\nCARLA:\nYes, if they ever do.\nCARLA:\nSo I think we’ve probably got enough for our presentation. It’s only fifteen minutes.\nROB:\nOK. So I suppose we’ll begin with some general historical background about why coastal cities were established. But\nwe don’t want to spend too long on that (Q26)\n, the other students will already know a bit about it. It’s all to do with communications and so on.\nCARLA:\nYes. We should mention some geographical factors, things like wetlands and river estuaries and coastal erosion and so on. We could have some maps of different cities with these features marked.\nROB:\nOn a handout you mean? Or\nsome slides everyone can see (Q27)\n?\nCARLA:\nYeah, that’d be better.\nROB:\nIt’d be good to go into past mistakes in a bit more detail. Did you read that case study of the problems there were in New Orleans with flooding a few years ago?\nCARLA:\nYes.\nWe could use that as the basis for that part of the talk (Q28)\n. I don’t think the other students will have read it, but they’ll remember hearing about the flooding at the time.\nROB:\nOK. So that’s probably enough background.\nCARLA:\nSo then we’ll go on to talk about what action’s being taken to deal with the problems of coastal cities.\nROB:\nOK. What else do we need to talk about? Maybe something on future risks, looking more at the long term, if populations continue to grow.\nCARLA:\nYeah. We’ll need to do a bit of work there, I haven’t got much information, have you?\nROB:\nNo.\nWe’ll need to look at some websites (Q29)\n. Shouldn’t take too long.\nCARLA:\nOK. And I think we should end by talking about international implications. Maybe\nwe could ask people in the audience (Q30)\n. We’ve got people from quite a lot of different places.\nROB:\nThat’d be interesting, if we have time, yes. So now shall we …\n剑桥雅思14 Test1 Section3雅思听力答案\n21. B\n22. A\n23. C\n24. B\n25. A\n26.

Demand is rising rapidly, because of the world’s increasing population and expanding\nindustry (Q31)\n. Burning fossil fuels, like gas, coal and oil, seriously damages the environment and they’ll eventually run out. For a number of years now, scientists have been working out how we can derive energy from renewable sources, such as the sun and wind, without causing pollution. Today I’ll outline marine renewable energy – also called ocean energy – which harnesses the movement of the oceans.\nMarine renewable energy can be divided into three main categories: wave energy, tidal energy and ocean thermal energy conversion, and I’ll say a few words about each one.\nFirst, wave energy. Numerous devices have been invented to harvest wave energy, with names such as Wave Dragon, the Penguin and Mighty Whale, and research is going on to try and come up with a really efficient method. This form of energy has plenty of potential, as the source is\nconstant (Q32)\n, and there’s no danger of waves coming to a standstill. Electricity can be generated using onshore systems, using a reservoir, or offshore systems. But the problem with ocean waves is that they’re erratic, with the wind making them travel in every\ndirection (Q33)\n. This adds to the difficulty of creating efficient technology: ideally all the waves would travel smoothly and regularly along the same straight line. Another drawback is that sand and other sediment on the ocean\nfloor (Q34)\nmight be stopped from flowing normally, which can lead to environmental problems.\nThe second category of marine energy that I’ll mention is tidal energy. One major advantage of using the tide, rather than waves, as a source of energy is that it’s\npredictable (Q35)\n: we know the exact times of high and low tides for years to come.\nFor tidal energy to be effective, the difference between high and low tides needs to be at least five metres, and this occurs naturally in only about forty places on Earth. But the right conditions can be created by constructing a tidal lagoon, an area of sea water separated from the sea.\nOne current plan is to create a tidal lagoon on the coast of Wales. This will be an area of water within a\nbay (Q36)\nat Swansea, sheltered by a U-shaped breakwater, or dam, built out from the coast. The breakwater will contain sixteen hydro turbines, and as the tide rises, water rushes through the breakwater, activating the turbines, which turn a generator to produce electricity. Then, for three hours as the tide goes out, the water is held back within the breakwater, increasing the difference in water level, until it’s several metres higher within the lagoon than in the open sea. Then, in order to release the stored water,\ngates (Q37)\nin the breakwater are opened. It pours powerfully out of the lagoon, driving the turbines in the breakwater in the opposite direction and again generating thousands of megawatts of electricity. As there are two high tides a day, this lagoon scheme would generate electricity four times a day, every day, for a total of around 14 hours in every 24 – and enough electricity for over 150,000 homes.\nThis system has quite a lot in its favour: unlike solar and wind energy it doesn’t depend on the weather; the turbines are operated without the need for\nfuel (Q38)\n, so it doesn’t create any greenhouse gas emissions; and very little maintenance is needed. It’s estimated that electricity generated in this way will be relatively cheap, and that manufacturing the components would create more than 2,000\njobs (Q39)\n, a big boost to the local economy.\nOn the other hand, there are fears that lagoons might harm both fish and birds, for example by disturbing\nmigration (Q40)\npatterns, and causing a build-up of silt, affecting local ecosystems.\nThere are other forms of tidal energy, but I’ll go on to the third category of marine energy: ocean thermal energy conversion. This depends on there being a big difference in temperature between surface water and the water a couple of kilometres below the surface, and this occurs in tropical coastal areas. The idea is to bring cold water up to the surface using a submerged pipe. The concept dates back to 1881, when …\n剑桥雅思14 Test1 Section4雅思听力答案\n31. industry\n32. constant\n33. direction\n34. floor\n35. predicatable\n36. bay\n37. gates\n38. fuel\n39. jobs\n40. migration"

Is it just a few days, or is it longer than that?\nJULIE:\nLonger. It’s been worse for the last couple of days, but it’s\nthree weeks (Q6)\nsince I first noticed it. It came on quite gradually though, so I kind of ignored it at first.\nCARL:\nAnd have you taken any medication yourself, or treated it in anyway?\nJULIE:\nYeah, I’ve been taking medication to deal with the pain, Tylenol, and that works OK for a few hours. But I don’t like to keep taking it.\nCARL:\nOK. And what about heat treatment? Have you tried applying heat at all?\nJULIE:\nNo, but I have been using ice on it for the last few days.\nCARL:\nAnd does that seem to help the pain at all?\nJULIE:\nA little, yes.\nCARL:\nGood.

The first building was a fort constructed in 914 AD for defence against Danish invaders by King Alfred the Great’s daughter, who ruled England at the time. In the following century, after the Normans conquered England, the land was given to a nobleman called Richard de Vere, and he built a castle there that stayed in the de Vere family for over four hundred years.\nHowever, when Queen Elizabeth I announced that she was going to visit the castle in 1576 it was beginning to look a bit run down, and it was decided that rather than repair the guest rooms,\nthey’d make a new house for her (Q11)\nout of wood next to the main hall. She stayed there for four nights and apparently it was very luxurious, but unfortunately it was destroyed a few years later by fire.\nIn the seventeenth century the castle belonged to the wealthy Fenys family, who enlarged it and made it more comfortable. However, by 1982 the Fenys family could no longer afford to maintain the castle, even though they received government support, and they put it on the market. It was eventually taken over by\na company who owned a number of amusement parks (Q12)\n, but when we get there I think you’ll see that they’ve managed to retain the original atmosphere of the castle.\nWhen you go inside, you’ll find that in the state rooms\nthere are life-like moving wax models dressed in costumes of different periods in the past (Q13)\n, which even carry on conversations together. As well as that, in every room there are booklets giving information about what the room was used for and the history of the objects and furniture it contains.\nThe castle park’s quite extensive. At one time sheep were kept there, and in the nineteenth century the owners had a little zoo with animals like rabbits and even a baby elephant. Nowadays the old zoo buildings are used for\npublic displays of paintings and sculpture (Q14)\n. The park also has some beautiful trees, though the oldest of all, which dated back 800 years, was sadly blown down in 1987.\nNow, you’re free to wander around on your own until 4.30, but then at the end of our visit we’ll all meet together at the bottom of the Great Staircase. We’ll then go on to the long gallery, where there’s a wonderful collection of photographs showing the family who owned the castle a hundred years ago having tea and cakes in the conservatory – and we’ll then take you to\nthe same place, where afternoon tea will be served to you (Q15)\n.\nNow if you can take a look at your plans you’ll see Branley Castle has four towers, joined together by a high wall, with the river on two sides.\nDon’t miss seeing the Great Hall. That’s near the river in the main tower, the biggest one, which was extended and redesigned in the eighteenth century.\nIf you want to get a good view of the whole castle, you can walk around the walls.\nThe starting point’s quite near the main entrance – walk straight down the path until you get to the south gate, and it’s just there (Q16)\n.

It was eventually taken over by a company who owned a number of amusement parks\n答案解析：虽然A，B选项都有提到，但它们并不是城堡的买家。Fenys family是原来的持所有者，而政府则提供资金支持。题干中sold to与taken over同义替换，因此确定答案为C。\n第13题答案：C\n对应原文：When you go inside, you’ll find that in the state rooms there are life-like moving wax models dressed in costumes of different periods in the past, which even carry on conversations together.\n答案解析：A选项中的experts，B选项中的actors和characters都属于无中生有，因此统统排除。C选项中models和moving为录音原词，historical figures对应different periods in the past，talking对应conversations，由此确定为正确答案。\n第14题答案：B\n对应原文：in the nineteenth century the owners had a little zoo with animals like rabbits and even a baby elephant. Nowadays the old zoo buildings are used for public displays of paintings and sculpture. The park also has some beautiful trees, though the oldest of all, which dated back 800 years, was sadly blown down in 1987.\n答案解析：A选项800年的古树在1987年的时候被吹倒了，而C选项的小型动物园则是19世纪的事情，因此统统排除。B选项art exhibition对应public displays of paintings and sculpture，由此确定为正确答案。\n第15题答案：A\n对应原文：at the end of our visit we’ll all meet together at the bottom of the Great Staircase. We’ll then go on to the long gallery, where there’s a wonderful collection of photographs showing the family who owned the castle a hundred years ago having tea and cakes in the conservatory – and we’ll then take you to the same place, where afternoon tea will be served to you\n答案解析：原文中说的是参观城堡主人的照片，既非见到他们真人，也非自己拍照片，因此排除B和C。而A选项的所有信息在原文中都可以找到对应，由此确定为正确答案。\n第16题答案：H\n对应原文：The starting point’s quite near the main entrance – walk straight down the path until you get to the south gate, and it’s just there\n答案解析：起始点位于主入口附近，沿着路往前走，直到到达south gate，因此确定答案为H。\n第17题答案：D\n对应原文：The quickest way to get there is to take the first left after the main entrance and follow the path past the bridge, then you’ll see it in front of you at the end\n答案解析：入口之后，第一个路口左拐，沿着路过去桥，弓箭展览就在你面前，由此确定D为正确答案。\n第18题答案：F\n对应原文：If you go from the main entrance in the direction of the south gate, but turn right before you get there instead of going through it, you’ll see it on your right past the first tower\n答案解析：从主入口朝着南门方向走去，在到达之前右转，经过第一座塔楼之后，Hunting birds display就在你右手边，由此确定F为正确答案。这道题比较坑的地方在于，大家需要根据图形特点，确定C选项所在位置为塔楼。\n第19题答案：A\n对应原文：traditional dancing on the outdoor stage. That’s right at the other side of the castle from the entrance, and over the bridge\n答案解析：传统舞蹈表演位于城堡入口的另一侧，需要过桥。由此确定A为正确答案。\n第20题答案：E\n对应原文： It’s actually inside one of the towers, but the way in is from the outside. Just take the first left after the main entrance, go down the path and take the first right\n答案解析：商店位于一座塔楼之中，但得从外面进去。进去主入口之后第一个路口左拐，沿着路走下去，再在随后的第一个路口右拐，由此确定E为正确答案。"

So it’s about a research project in North America?\nMARTIN:\nYes. But we thought we needed something general about woolly mammoths in our introduction, to establish that they were related to our modern elephant, and they lived thousands of years ago in the last ice age.\nROSIE:\nMaybe we could show a video clip of a cartoon about mammoths. But that’d be a bit childish. Or we could have a diagram,\nit could be a timeline to show when they lived, with illustrations (Q21)\n?\nMARTIN:\nOr we could just show a drawing of them walking in the ice? No, let’s go with your last suggestion.\nTUTOR:\nGood. Then you’re describing the discovery of the mammoth tooth on St Paul’s Island in Alaska, and why it was significant.\nMARTIN:\nYes. The tooth was found by a man called Russell Graham. He picked it up from under a rock in a cave. He knew it was special – for a start it was in really good condition, as if it had been just extracted from the animal’s jawbone. Anyway, they found it was 6,500 years old.\nTUTOR:\nSo why was that significant?\nROSE:\nWell\nthe mammoth bones previously found on the North American mainland were much less recent than that (Q22)\n. So this was really amazing.\nMARTIN:\nThen we’re making an animated diagram to show the geography of the area in prehistoric times. So originally, St Paul’s Island wasn’t an island, it was connected to the mainland, and mammoths and other animals like bears were able to roam around the whole area.\nROSE:\nThen the climate warmed up and the sea level began to rise, and the island got cut off from the mainland.\nSo those mammoths on the island couldn’t escape; they had to stay on the island (Q23)\n.\nMARTIN:\nAnd in fact the species survived there for thousands of years after they’d become extinct on the mainland.\nTUTOR:\nSo why do you think they died out on the mainland?\nROSIE:\nNo one’s sure.\nMARTIN:\nAnyway, next we’ll explain how Graham and his team identified the date when the mammoths became extinct on the island.\nThey concluded that the extinction happened 5.600 years ago, which is a very precise time for a prehistoric extinction (Q24)\n. It’s based on samples they took from mud at the bottom of a lake on the island. They analysed it to find out what had fallen in over time – bits of plants, volcanic ash and even DNA from the mammoths themselves. It’s standard procedure, but it took nearly two years to do.\nTUTOR:\nSo why don’t you quickly go through the main sections of your presentation and discuss what action’s needed for each part?\nMARTIN:\nOK. So for the introduction, we’re using a visual, so once we’ve prepared that we’re done.\nROSIE:\nI’m not sure.\nI think we need to write down all the ideas we want to include here (Q25)\n, not just rely on memory. How we begin the presentation is so important…\nMARTIN:\nYou’re right.\nROSIE:\nThe discovery of the mammoth tooth is probably the most dramatic part, but we don’t have that much information, only what we got from the online article. I thought maybe\nwe could get in touch with the researcher who led the team and ask him to tell us a bit more (Q26)\n.\nMARTIN:\nGreat idea. What about the section with the initial questions asked by the researchers? We’ve got a lot on that but we need to make it interesting.\nROSIE:\nWe could\nask the audience to suggest some questions about it and then see how many of them we can answer (Q27)\n. I don’t think it would take too long.\nTUTOR:\nYes that would add a bit of variety.\nMARTIN:\nThen the section on further research carried out on the island – analysing the mud in the lake. I wonder if we’ve actually got too much information here, should we cut some?\nROSIE:\nI don’t think so, but it’s all a bit muddled at present.\nMARTIN:\nYes,\nmaybe it would be better if it followed a chronological pattern (Q28)\n.\nROSIE:\nI think so. The findings and possible explanations section is just about ready, but we need to practise it\nso we’re sure it won’t overrun (Q29)\n.\nMARTIN:\nI think it should be OK, but yes, let’s make sure.\nTUTOR:\nIn the last section, relevance to the present day, you’ve got some good ideas but this is where you need to move away from the ideas of others and\ngive your own viewpoint (Q30)\n.\nMARTIN:\nOK, we’ll think about that.

Most ancient cultures had weather gods, and weather catastrophes, such as floods, played an important role in many creation myths. Generally, weather was attributed to the whims of the gods, as the wide range of weather gods in various cultures shows. For instance, there’s the Egyptian sun god Ra, and Thor, the Norse god of thunder and lightning. Many ancient civilisations developed rites such as\ndances (Q31)\nin order to make the weather gods look kindly on them.\nBut the weather was of daily importance: observing the skies and drawing the correct conclusions from these observations was really important, in fact their\nsurvival (Q32)\ndepended on it. It isn’t known when people first started to observe the skies, but at around 650 BC, the Babylonians produced the first short-range weather forecasts, based on their observations of\nclouds (Q33)\nand other phenomena. The Chinese also recognised weather patterns, and by 300 BC, astronomers had developed a calendar which divided the year into 24\nfestivals (Q34)\n, each associated with a different weather phenomenon.\nThe ancient Greeks were the first to develop a more scientific approach to explaining the weather. The work of the philosopher and scientist Aristotle, in the fourth century BC, is especially noteworthy, as his ideas held sway for nearly 2,000 years. In 340 BC, he wrote a book in which he attempted to account for the formation of rain, clouds, wind and storms. He also described celestial phenomena such as haloes – that is, bright circles of light around the sun, the moon and bright stars – and\ncomets (Q35)\n. . Many of his observations were surprisingly accurate. For example, he believed that heat could cause water to evaporate. But he also jumped to quite a few wrong conclusions, such as that winds are breathed out by the Earth. Errors like this were rectified from the Renaissance onwards.\nFor nearly 2,000 years, Aristotle’s work was accepted as the chief authority on weather theory. Alongside this, though, in the Middle Ages weather observations were passed on in the form of proverbs, such as ‘Red sky at night, shepherd’s delight; red\nsky (Q36)\nin the morning, shepherd’s warning’. Many of these are based on very good observations and are accurate, as contemporary meteorologists have discovered.\nFor centuries, any attempt to forecast the weather could only be based on personal observations, but in the fifteenth century scientists began to see the need for\ninstruments (Q37)\n. Until then, the only ones available were weather vanes – to determine the wind direction – and early versions of rain gauges. One of the first, invented in the fifteenth century, was a hygrometer, which measured humidity. This was one of many inventions that contributed to the development of weather forecasting.\nIn 1592, the Italian scientist and inventor Galileo developed the world’s first\nthermometer (Q38)\n. His student Torricelli later invented the barometer, which allowed people to measure atmospheric pressure. In 1648, the French philosopher Pascal proved that pressure decreases with altitude. This discovery was verified by English astronomer Halley in 1686; and Halley was also the first person to map trade winds.\nThis increasing ability to measure factors related to weather helped scientists to understand the atmosphere and its processes better, and they started collecting weather observation data systematically. In the eighteenth century, the scientist and politician Benjamin Franklin carried out work on electricity and lightning in particular, but he was also very interested in weather and studied it throughout most of his life. It was Franklin who discovered that\nstorms (Q39)\ngenerally travel from west to east.\nIn addition to new meteorological instruments, other developments contributed to our understanding of the atmosphere. People in different locations began to keep records, and in the mid-nineteenth century, the invention of the\ntelegraph (Q40)\nmade it possible for these records to be collated. This led, by the end of the nineteenth century, to the first weather services.\nIt was not until the early twentieth century that mathematics and physics became part of meteorology, and we’ll continue from that point next week.\n剑桥雅思14 Test2 Section4雅思听力答案\n31. dances\n32. survival\n33. clouds\n34. festivals\n35. comets\n36. sky\n37. instruments\n38. thermometer\n39. storms\n40. telegraph"

We can do a two-course meal with a number of different options.\nMAN: What sort of price are we looking at for that?\nANGELA: Well, I can send you a copy of the standard menu. That’s\n$45 (Q5)\nper person. Or you can have the special for $25 more.\nMAN: I think the standard should be OK, but yes, send me the menu.\nMAN: Now we’re also going to need accommodation on the Saturday night for some of the participants … I’m not sure how many, but probably about 25. So what do you charge for a room?\nANGELA: Well, for conference attendees we have a 25% reduction, so we can offer you rooms at\n$135 (Q6)\n. Normally a standard room’s $180.\nMAN: And does that include breakfast?\nANGELA: Sure. And of course, guests can also make use of all the other facilities at the hotel. So we’ve got a spa where you can get massages and facials and so on, and there’s a\npool (Q7)\nup on the roof for the use of guests.\nMAN: Great. Now what about transport links? The hotel’s downtown, isn’t it?\nANGELA: Yes, it’s about 12 kilometres from the\nairport (Q8)\n, but there’s a complimentary shuttle bus for guests. And it’s only about ten minutes’ walk from the central railway station.\nMAN: OK. Now, I don’t know Sydney very well, can you just give me an idea of the location of the hotel?\nANGELA: Well, it’s downtown on Wilby Street, that’s quite a small street, and it’s not very far from the\nsea (Q9)\n. And of course if the conference attendees want to go out on the Saturday evening there’s a huge choice of places to eat. Then if they want to make a night of it, they can go on to one of the\nclubs (Q10)\nin the area – there are a great many to choose from.\nMAN: OK. So if we go ahead with this, can you give me some information about how much …\n剑桥雅思14 Test3 Section1雅思听力答案\n1.

My name’s Lucy Crittenden, and I’m the Director of Operations for an organisation that arranges volunteering in this part of the country. I’m hoping I can persuade one or two of you to become volunteers yourselves. Let me start by briefly explaining what we mean by volunteering.\nVolunteers are teenagers and adults who choose to spend some time, unpaid, helping other people in some way. Most volunteers devote two or three hours to this every week, while a few do much more. The people they help may have physical or behavioural difficulties, for example.\nVolunteers can do all sorts of things, depending on their own abilities and interests. If they’re supporting a family that’s struggling, for example, they may be able to give them tips on cooking, or recommend how to plan their budget or how to shop sensibly on their income. They might even do\nsome painting or wallpapering (Q11)\n, perhaps alongside any members of the family who are able to do it. Or even do\nsome babysitting (Q12)\nso that parents can go out for a while.\nThe benefit from volunteering isn’t only for the people being helped. Volunteers also gain from it: they’re using their skills to cope with somebody’s mental or physical ill health, and\nvolunteering may be a valuable element of their CV when they’re applying for jobs (Q13)\n: employers usually look favourably on someone who’s given up time to help others. Significantly,\nmost volunteers feel that what they’re doing gives them a purpose in their lives (Q14)\n. And in my opinion, they’re lucky in that respect, as many people don’t have that feeling.\nNow I’d like to tell you what some of our volunteers have said about what they do, to give you an idea of the range of ways in which they can help people.\nHabib supports an elderly lady who’s beginning to show signs of dementia. Once a week they, along with other elderly people, go to the local community centre, where a group of people come in and sing. The songs\ntake the listeners back to their youth (Q15)\n, and for a little while they can forget the difficulties that they face now.\nOur volunteer Consuela is an amazing woman.\nShe has difficulty walking herself, but she doesn’t let that stop her\n. She helps a couple of people with similar difficulties, who had almost stopped walking altogether.\nBy using herself as an example. Consuela encourages them to walk more and more (Q16)\n.\nMinh visits a young man who lives alone and can’t leave his home on his own, so he hardly ever saw anyone. But together\nthey go out to the cinema, or to see friends (Q17)\nthe young man hadn’t been able to visit for a long time.\nTanya visits an elderly woman once a week. When the woman found out that Tanya is a professional dressmaker, she got interested. Tanya showed her some soft toys she’d made, and\nthe woman decided to try it herself (Q18)\n. And now she really enjoys it, and spends hours making toys. They’re not perhaps up to Tanya’s standard yet, but she gains a lot of pleasure from doing it.\nAlexei is a volunteer with a family that faces a number of difficulties. By calmly talking over possible solutions with family members, he’s helping them to realise that they aren’t helpless, and that\nthey can do something themselves to improve their situation (Q19)\n. This has been great for their self-esteem.\nAnd the last volunteer I’ll mention, though there are plenty more, is Juba. She volunteers with a teenage girl with learning difficulties, who wasn’t very good at talking to other people. Juba’s worked very patiently with her, and\nnow the girl is far better at expressing herself, and at understanding other people (Q20)\n.\nOK, I hope that’s given you an idea of what volunteering is all about. Now I’d like …\n剑桥雅思14 Test3 Section2雅思听力答案\n11-12. AE\n13-14. BE\n15. F\n16. A\n17. R\n18. G\n19. D\n20. C"

And now she really enjoys it, and spends hours making toys.\n答案解析：Tanya给老人展示了一些她自己制作的玩具，随后老人决定自己尝试一下，并彻底爱上了这件事情。即发展出新的爱好，由此确定G为正确答案。\n第19题答案：D\n对应原文：By calmly talking over possible solutions with family members, he’s helping them to realise that they aren’t helpless, and that they can do something themselves to improve their situation\n答案解析：Alexei则是跟家庭成员讨论可能的解决方案，让他们意识到他们能够自己做一些事情提升境遇。D选项independently与themselves同义替换，由此确定为正确答案。\n第20题答案：C\n对应原文： Juba’s worked very patiently with her, and now the girl is far better at expressing herself, and at understanding other people\n答案解析：Juba对女孩十分耐心，现在女孩更加擅长表达自己，也更加理解他人。选项中唯一跟这些内容沾边的就是C communications skills，由此确定它为正确答案。"

I’d like to talk it over with you.\nLIZZIE:\nGo ahead. You’d better start by giving me a bit of background.\nJOE:\nOK. Well the band has students in it from all years, so they’re aged 11 to 18, and there are about\n50 (Q21)\nof them altogether. It’s quite a popular activity within the school. I’ve never worked with a band of more than 20 before, and this is very different.\nLIZZIE:\nI can imagine.\nJOE:\nThey aren’t really good enough to enter national band competitions, but they’re in a\nregional (Q22)\none later in the term. Even if they don’t win, and I don’t expect them to, hopefully it’ll be an incentive for them to try and improve.\nLIZZIE:\nYes, hopefully.\nJOE:\nWell, now the town council’s organising a\ncarnival (Q23)\nin the summer, and the band has been asked to perform. If you ask me, they aren’t really up to it yet, and I need to get them functioning better as a band, and in a very short time.\nLIZZIE:\nHave you been doing anything with them? Apart from practising the music, I mean.\nJOE:\nI played a recording I came across, of a\ndrummer (Q24)\ntalking about how playing in a band had changed his life. I think it was an after-dinner speech. I thought it was pretty inspiring, because being in the band had stopped him from getting involved in crime. The students seemed to find it interesting, too.\nLIZZIE:\nThat’s good.\nJOE:\nI’m planning to show them that old\nfilm (Q25)\nfrom the 1940s ‘Strike Up the Band’, and talk about it with the students. What do you think?\nLIZZIE:\nGood idea. As it’s about a school band, it might make the students realise how much they can achieve if they work together.\nJOE:\nThat’s what I’ve got in mind. I’m hoping I can take some of the band to a\nparade (Q26)\nthat’s going to take place next month. A couple of marching bands will be performing, and the atmosphere should be quite exciting. It depends on whether I can persuade the school to hire a coach or two to take us there.\nLIZZIE:\nMmm. They sound like good ideas to me.\nJOE:\nThanks.\nJOE:\nCan I tell you about a few people in the band who I’m finding it quite difficult to cope with? I’m sure you’ll have some ideas about what I can do.\nLIZZIE:\nGo ahead.\nJOE:\nThere’s a flautist who says she loves playing in the band. We rehearse twice a week after school, but\nshe’s hardly ever there (Q27)\n. Then she looks for me the next day and gives me a very plausible reason – she says she had to help her mother, or she’s been ill, but to be honest, I don’t believe her.\nLIZZIE:\nOh dear! Any more students with difficulties?\nJOE:\nPlenty! There’s a trumpeter who thinks she’s the best musician in the band, though she certainly isn’t.\nShe’s always saying what she thinks other people should do (Q28)\n, which makes my job pretty difficult.\nLIZZIE:\nShe sounds a bit of a nightmare!\nJOE:\nYou can say that again. One of the trombonists has got an impressive sense of rhythm, and could be an excellent musician – except that\nhe has breathing difficulties, and he doesn’t really have enough breath for the trombone (Q29)\n. He’d be much better off playing percussion, for instance, but he refuses to give up. So he ends up only playing half the notes.\nLIZZIE:\nI suppose you have to admire his determination.\nJOE:\nMaybe. One of the percussionists isn’t too bad, but\nhe never seems to interact with other people, and he always rushes off as soon as the rehearsal ends (Q30)\n. I don’t know if there are family reasons, or what. But it isn’t good in a band, where people really need to feel they’re part of a group.\nLIZZIE:\nHmm.\nJOE:\nThere are others too, but at least that gives you an idea of what I’m up against. Do you have any thoughts about what I can do, Lizzie?\n剑桥雅思14 Test3 Section3雅思听力答案\n21. 50\n22. regional\n23. carnival\n24. drummer\n25. film\n26. parade\n27. D\n28. B\n29. E\n30. F"

These will be public performances, and the programme has just been finalised. The theme of the festival is links between the UK and Australia, and this is reflected in the music: each concert will feature both British and Australian composers. I’ll tell you briefly about the Australian music, as you probably won’t be familiar with that.\nThe first concert will include music by Liza Lim, who was born in Perth, Western Australia, in 1966. As a child, Lim originally learned to play the piano – like so many children – and also the\nviolin (Q31)\n, but when she was 11 her teachers encouraged her to start composing. She found this was her real strength, and she studied and later taught composition, both in Australia and in other countries. As a composer, she has received commissions from numerous orchestras, other performers and festivals in several countries.\nLiza Lim’s compositions are vibrant and full of\nenergy (Q32)\n, and she often explores Asian and Australian Aboriginal cultural sources, including the native instrument, the didgeridoo: this is featured in a work called The Compass. Her music is very expressive, so although it is\ncomplex (Q33)\n, it has the power of connecting with audiences and performers alike.\nIn the festival we’re going to give a semi-staged performance of The Oresteia. This is an\nopera (Q34)\nin seven parts, based on the trilogy of ancient Greek tragedies by Aeschylus. Lim composed this when she was in her mid-20s, and she also wrote the text, along with Barrie Kosky. It’s performed by six singers, a dancer, and an orchestra that, as well as standard orchestral instruments, includes electric guitar, and a traditional Turkish stringed instrument. Lim wrote that because the stories in the tragedies are not easy to tell, the sounds she creates are also\ndisturbing (Q35)\n, and they include breathing, sobbing, laughing and whistling. The work lasts around 75 minutes, and the rest of the concert will consist of orchestral works by the British composers Ralph Vaughan Williams and Frederick Delius.\nMoving on now to our second concert, this will begin with instrumental music by British composers – Benjamin Britten and Judith Weir. After the interval we’ll go to Australia for a piece by Ross Edwards: The Tower of Remoteness. According to Edwards, the inspiration for this piece came from nature, when he was sitting alone in the dry bed of a creek, overshadowed by the leaves of palm trees, listening to the birds and insects. The Tower of Remoteness is scored for piano and\nclarinet (Q36)\n. Edwards says he realised years after writing the piece that he had subconsciously modelled its opening phrase on a bird call.\nRoss Edwards was born in 1943 in Sydney, Australia, and studied at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and the universities of Adelaide and Sydney. He’s well known in Australia, and in fact he’s one of the country’s most performed composers. He’s written a wide range of music, from symphonies and concertos to some composed specifically for children. Edwards’s music has been described as being ‘deeply connected to Australia’, and it can be regarded as a celebration of the\ndiversity (Q37)\nof cultures that Australia can be proud of.\nThe last of the three Australian composers to be represented in our festival is Carl Vine. Born in 1954, Vine, like Liza Lim, comes from Perth, Western Australia. He took up the cornet at the age of five, switching to the piano five years later. However, he went to university to study\nphysics (Q38)\n, before changing to composition. After graduating he moved to Sydney and worked as a freelance pianist and composer. Before long he had become prominent in Australia as a composer for\ndance (Q39)\n, and in fact has written 25 scores of that type.\nIn our third concert, Vine will be represented by his music for the flag hand-over ceremony of the\nOlympics (Q40)\nheld in 1996. This seven-minute orchestral piece was of course heard by millions of people worldwide, and we’ll hear it alongside works written by British composers Edward Elgar and, more recently, Thomas Adès.\n剑桥雅思14 Test3 Section4雅思听力答案\n31. violin\n32. energy\n33. complex\n34. opera\n35. disturbing\n36. clarinet\n37. diversity\n38. physics\n39. dance\n40.

Andrew speaking. I’m the Events Manager.    Example\nSAM:\nGood morning, Andrew. My name’s Samantha. I’m arranging a party for my parents’ fiftieth wedding anniversary, and I’m ringing to ask about hiring a room some time next September. Also my parents and several of the guests will need accommodation.\nANDREW:\nOK, I’m sure we can help you with that. Will you be having a sit-down meal or a buffet?\nSAM:\nProbably a sit-down.\nANDREW:\nAnd do you know how many people there’ll be?\nSAM:\nAround eighty, I think.\nANDREW:\nWell we have two rooms that can hold that number. One is the Adelphi Room. That can seat\neighty-five (Q1)\n, or hold over a hundred if people are standing for a buffet.\nSAM:\nRight.\nANDREW:\nIf you have live music, there’s room for four or five musicians in the gallery overlooking the room. Our guests usually appreciate the fact that the music can be loud enough for dancing, but not too loud for conversation.\nSAM:\nYes, I really don’t like it when you can’t talk.\nANDREW:\nExactly. Now the Adelphi Room is at the back of the hotel, and there are French windows leading out onto the terrace. This has a beautiful display of pots of\nroses (Q2)\nat that time of the year.\nSAM:\nWhich direction does it face?\nANDREW:\nSouthwest, so that side of the hotel gets the sun in the afternoon and early evening.\nSAM:\nVery nice.\nANDREW:\nFrom the terrace you can see the area of\ntrees (Q3)\nwithin the grounds of the hotel, or you can stroll through there to the river – that’s on the far side, so it isn’t visible from the hotel.\nSAM:\nOK.\nANDREW:\nThen another option is the Carlton Room. This is a bit bigger – it can hold up to a hundred and ten people – and it has the advantage of a\nstage (Q4)\n, which is useful if you have any entertainment, or indeed a small band can fit onto it.\nSAM:\nAnd can you go outside from the room?\nANDREW:\nNo, the Carlton Room is on the first floor, but on one side the windows look out onto the lake.\nSAM:\nLovely. I think either of those rooms would be suitable.\nANDREW:\nCan I tell you about some of the options we offer in addition?\nSAM:\nPlease do.\nANDREW:\nAs well as a meal, you can have an MC, a Master of Ceremonies, who’ll be with you throughout the party.\nSAM:\nWhat exactly is the MC’s function? I suppose they make a\nspeech (Q5)\nduring the meal if we need one, do they?\nANDREW:\nThat’s right. All our MCs are trained as public speakers, so they can easily get people’s attention – many guests are glad to have someone who can make themselves heard above the chatter! And they’re also your\nsupport (Q6)\n– if anything goes wrong, the MC will deal with it, so you can relax.\nSAM:\nGreat! I’ll need to ask you about food, but something else that’s important is accommodation. You obviously have rooms in the hotel, but do you also have any other accommodation, like\ncabins (Q7)\n, for example?\nANDREW:\nYes, there are five in the grounds, all self-contained. They each sleep two to four people and have their own living room, bathroom and small kitchen.\nSAM:\nThat sounds perfect for what we’ll need.\nSAM:\nNow you have various facilities, don’t you? Are they all included in the price of hiring the room? The pool, for instance.\nANDREW:\nNormally you’d be able to use it, but\nit’ll be closed throughout September for refurbishment (Q8)\n, I’m afraid.\nThe gym will be available, though, at no extra charge (Q9)\n. That’s open all day, from six in the morning until midnight.\nSAM:\nRight.\nANDREW:\nAnd the tennis courts, but\nthere is a small additional payment for those (Q10)\n. We have four courts, and it’s worth booking in advance if you possibly can, as there can be quite a long waiting list for them!\nSAM:\nRight. Now could we discuss the food? This would be dinner, around seven o’clock…\n剑桥雅思14 Test4 Section1雅思听力答案\n1. 85\n2. roses\n3. trees\n4. stage\n5. speech\n6. support\n7. cabins\n8. C\n9. A\n10. B"

That can seat\neighty-five\n, or hold over a hundred if people are standing for a buffet.\n答案解析：设置了一个小小的干扰项，该房间能坐85人，但如果人们站着吃自助餐的话则能够容纳100人。题干中的限定条件为sit down to eat，因此锁定85。\n第2题答案：roses\n对应原文：There are French windows leading out onto the terrace. This has a beautiful display of pots of\nroses\nat that time of the year.\n答案解析：听到out和terrace意识到答案即将到来。从题干内容可以事先猜测出空上填的是某种景物，再加上pots的修饰，可以比较容易的锁定roses。\n第3题答案：trees\n对应原文：From the terrace you can see the area of\ntrees\nwithin the grounds of the hotel\n答案解析：同样是terrace提示大家答案即将到来，空前词a group of与the area of同义替换，根据修饰关系确定trees为正确答案。\n第4题答案：stage\n对应原文：it can hold up to a hundred and ten people – and it has the advantage of a\nstage\n答案解析：数字110提示大家答案即将到来。从题干内容可以猜测出空上大概要填某种设施，由此锁定stage。\n第5题答案：speech\n对应原文：What exactly is the MC’s function? I suppose they make a\nspeech\nduring the meal if we need one, do they?\n答案解析：听到房间名称意识到老烤鸭雅思答案即将到来，空前词make与give同义替换，由此确定speech为正确答案。当然，如果觉得这两个单词的同义替换有些不太明显的话，也可以根据重读和语义筛选出speech。\n第6题答案：support\n对应原文：And they’re also your\nsupport\n– if anything goes wrong, the MC will deal with it, so you can relax.\n答案解析：答案之前没有明显的提示词，只能听到if anything goes wrong之后再进行回想，比较考验大家的短期记忆能力。\n第7题答案：cabins\n对应原文：You obviously have rooms in the hotel, but do you also have any other accommodation, like\ncabins\n, for example?\n答案解析：考察并列关系，听到rooms和hotel意识到答案即将到来，also与or对应，accommodation不够具体，因此排除选择cabins。\n第8题答案：C\n对应原文：but it’ll be closed throughout September for refurbishment\n答案解析：户外游泳池正处于整修之中，因此整个九月都会关闭。由此确定答案为C。\n第9题答案：A\n对应原文：The gym will be available, though, at no extra charge. That’s open all day, from six in the morning until midnight.\n答案解析： 健身房目前开着，而且不用额外付费，因此确定答案为A（费用包含在房费里）。\n第10题答案：B\n对应原文：And the tennis courts, but there is a small additional payment for those\n答案解析：网球场需要另外付费。B选项extra charge与additional payment同义替换，由此确定为正确答案。"

I’m Jake Stevens and I’m your rep here at the hotel. I’m sure you’ll all have a great time here. So let me tell you a bit about what’s on offer. I’ll start by telling you about some of the excursions that are available for guests.\nOne thing you have to do while you’re here is go dolphin watching. On our boat trips, we pretty well guarantee you’ll see dolphins – if you don’t you can repeat the trip free of charge. We organise daily trips for just 35 euros. Unfortunately\nthere aren’t any places left for this afternoon’s trip (Q11)\n, but come and see me to book for later in the week.\nIf you’re energetic, I’d recommend our forest walk. It’s a guided walk of about seven kilometres. There’ll be a stop half way, and\nyou’ll be provided with a drink and sandwiches (Q12)\n. There’s some fairly steep climbs up the hills, so you need to be reasonably fit for this one, with good shoes, and bring a waterproof in case it rains. It’s just 25 euros all inclusive, and it’s every Wednesday.\nThen on Thursdays we organise a cycle trip, which will give you all the fun of biking without the effort. We’ll take you and your bike up to the top of Mount Larna, and leave you to bike back –\nit’s a 700-metre drop in just 20 kilometres (Q13)\nso this isn’t really for inexperienced cyclists as you’ll be going pretty fast. And if it’s a clear day, you’ll have fantastic views.\nOn our local craft tour you can find out about the traditional activities in the island. And the best thing about this trip is that\nit’s completely free (Q14)\n. You’ll be taken to a factory where jewellery is made, and also a ceramics centre. If you want, you can buy some of the products but that’s entirely up to you. The trip starts after lunch on Thursday, and you’ll return by 6 pm.\nIf you’re interested in astronomy you may already know that the island’s one of the best places in the world to observe the night sky. We can offer trips to the observatory on Friday for those who are interested. They cost 90 euros per person and you’ll be shown the huge telescopes and have a talk from an expert, who’ll explain all about how they work.\nAfterwards we’ll head down to Sunset Beach, where you can have a dip in the ocean (Q15)\nif you want before we head off back to the hotel.\nFinally, there’s horse riding. This is organised by the Equestrian Centre over near Playa Cortino and it’s a great experience if you’re a keen horseback rider, or\neven if you’ve never been on a horse before (Q16)\n. They take you down to the beach, and you can canter along the sand and through the waves. It costs 35 euros and it’s available every day.\nSo there’s plenty to do in the daytime, but what about night life?\nWell, the number one attraction’s called ‘Musical Favourites, . Guests enjoy a three-course meal and unlimited free drinks, and watch a fantastic show, starting with musicals set in Paris and then crossing the Atlantic to Las Vegas and finally Copacabana. At the end the\ncast members come down from the stage\n, still in their stunning costumes, and\nyou’ll have a chance to chat with them (Q17)\n. It’s hugely popular, so let me know now if you’re interested because\nit’s no good leaving it until the last minute (Q18)\n. It’s on Friday night. Tickets are just 50 euros each, but for an extra 10 euros you can have a table right by the stage.\nIf you’d like to go back in time, there’s the Castle Feast on Saturday evening. It’s held in a twelfth-century castle, and you eat in the great courtyard, with ladies in long gowns serving your food. You’re given a whole chicken each, which you eat in the medieval way,\nusing your hands instead of cutlery (Q19)\n, and you’re entertained by competitions where the horseback riders attempt to knock one another off their horses. Then you can watch the dancers in the ballroom and\njoin in as well if you want (Q20)\n. OK, so now if anyone …\n剑桥雅思14 Test4 Section2雅思听力答案\n11. G\n12. D\n13. A\n14. E\n15. F\n16. B\n17-18.

You said you wanted to talk about the course I’m taking on literature for children.\nSTEPHANIE:\nThat’s right. I’m thinking of doing it next year, but I’d like to find out more about it first.\nTREVOR:\nOK, well, as you probably know, it’s a one-year course. It’s divided into six modules, and you have to take all of them. One of the most interesting ones, for me, at least, was about the purpose of children’s literature.\nSTEPHANIE:\nYou mean, whether it should just entertain children or should be educational, as well.\nTREVOR:\nRight, and whether the teaching should be factual – giving them information about the world – or ethical, teaching them values. What’s fascinating is that\nthe writer isn’t necessarily conscious of the message they’re conveying (Q21)\n. For instance, a story might show a child who has a problem as a result of not doing what an adult has told them to do, implying that children should always obey adults.\nSTEPHANIE:\nI see what you mean.\nTREVOR:\nThat module made me realise how important stories are – they can have a significant effect on children as they grow up. Actually,\nit inspired me to have a go at it myself (Q22)\n, just for my own interest. I know I can’t compete with the really popular stories, like the Harry Potter books – they’re very good, and even young kids like my seven-year-old niece love reading them.\nSTEPHANIE:\nMm. I’m very interested in illustrations in stories. Is that covered in the course?\nTREVOR:\nYes, there’s a module on pictures, and how they’re sometimes central to the story.\nSTEPHANIE:\nThat’s good. I remember some frightening ones I saw as a child and I can still see them vividly in my mind, years later! Pictures can be so powerful, just as powerful as words. I’ve always enjoyed drawing, so\nthat’s the field I want to go into when I finish the course (Q23)\n. I bet that module will be really helpful.\nTREVOR:\nI’m sure it will. We also studied comics in that module, but I’m not convinced of their value, not compared with books. One of the great things about words is that you use your imagination, but with a comic you don’t have to.\nSTEPHANIE:\nBut children are so used to visual input – on TV, video games, and so on. There are plenty of kids who wouldn’t even try to read a book, so I think\ncomics can serve a really useful purpose (Q24)\n.\nTREVOR:\nYou mean, it’s better to read a comic than not to read at all? Yes, I suppose you’re right. I just think it’s sad when children don’t read books.\nSTEPHANIE:\nWhat about books for girls and books for boys? Does the course go into that?\nTREVOR:\nYes, there’s a module on it. For years, lots of stories, in English, at least, assumed that boys went out and did adventurous things and girls stayed at home and played with dolls. I was amazed\nhow many books were targeted at just one sex or the other (Q25)\n. Of course this reflects society as it is when the books are written.\nSTEPHANIE:\nThat’s true. So it sounds as though you think it’s a good course.\nTREVOR:\nDefinitely.\nTREVOR:\nHave you been reading lots of children’s stories, to help you decide whether to take the course?\nSTEPHANIE:\nYeah. I’ve gone as far back as the late seventeenth century, though I know there were earlier children’s stories.\nTREVOR:\nSo does that mean you’ve read Perrault’s fairy tales? Cinderella, The Sleeping Beauty, and so on.\nSTEPHANIE:\nYes. They must be important,\nbecause no stories of that type had been written before, these were the first (Q26)\n. Then there’s The Swiss Family Robinson.\nTREVOR:\nI haven’t read that.\nSTEPHANIE:\nThe English name makes it sound as though Robinson is the family’s surname, but a more accurate translation would be The Swiss Robinsons, because it’s about\na Swiss family who are shipwrecked, like Robinson Crusoe in the novel of a century earlier (Q27)\n.\nTREVOR:\nWell I never knew that!\nSTEPHANIE:\nHave you read Hoffmann’s The Nutcracker and the Mouse King?\nTREVOR:\nWasn’t that\nthe basis for Tchaikovsky’s ballet The Nutcracker (Q28)\n?\nSTEPHANIE:\nThat’s right. It has some quite bizarre elements.\nTREVOR:\nI hope you’ve read Oscar Wilde’s The Happy Prince. It’s probably my favourite children’s story of all time.\nSTEPHANIE:\nMine too!

It’s the study of ships, cargoes, shipping facilities, and other physical remains. I’ll give you an example, then go on to show how this type of research is being transformed by the use of the latest technology.\nAtlit-Yam was a village on the coast of the eastern Mediterranean, which seems to have been thriving until around 7,000 BC. The residents kept cattle, caught fish and stored grain. They had wells for fresh water, many of their houses were built around a courtyard and were constructed of stone. The village contained an impressive monument: seven half-tonne stones standing in a semicircle around a\nspring (Q31)\n, that might have been used for ceremonial purposes.\nAtlit-Yam may have been destroyed swiftly by a tsunami, or climate change may have caused glaciers to melt and sea levels to rise, flooding the village gradually. Whatever the cause, it now lies ten metres below the surface of the Mediterranean, buried under sand at the bottom of the sea. It’s been described as the largest and best preserved prehistoric settlement ever found on the seabed.\nFor marine archaeologists, Atlit-Yam is a treasure trove. Research on the buildings,\ntools (Q32)\nand the human remains has revealed how the bustling village once functioned, and even what diseases some of its residents suffered from. But of course this is only one small village, one window into a lost world. For a fuller picture, researchers need more sunken settlements, but the hard part is finding them.\nUnderwater research used to require divers to find shipwrecks or artefacts, but in the second half of the twentieth century, various types of underwater vehicles were developed, some controlled from a ship on the surface, and some of them autonomous, which means they don’t need to be operated by a person.\nAutonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, are used in the oil industry, for instance, to create\nmaps (Q33)\nof the seabed before rigs and pipelines are installed. To navigate they use sensors, such as compasses and sonar. Until relatively recently they were very expensive, and so\nheavy (Q34)\nthat they had to be launched from a large vessel with a winch.\nBut the latest AUVs are much easier to manoeuvre – they can be launched from the shore or a small ship. And they’re much cheaper, which makes them more accessible to research teams. They’re also very sophisticated. They can communicate with each other and, for example, work out the most efficient way to survey a site, or to find particular objects on the seabed.\nField tests show the approach can work. For example, in a trial in 2015, three AUVs searched for wrecks at Marzamemi, off the coast of Sicily. The site is the final resting place of an ancient Roman ship, which sank in the sixth century AD while ferrying prefabricated\nmarble (Q35)\nelements for the construction of an early church. The AUVs mapped the area in detail, finding other ships carrying columns of the same material.\nCreating an internet in the sea for AUVs to communicate is no easy matter. Wifi networks on land use electromagnetic waves, but in water these will only travel a few centimetres. Instead, a more complex mix of technologies is required. For short distances, AUVs can share data using\nlight (Q36)\n, while acoustic waves are used to communicate over long distances. But more creative solutions are also being developed, where an AUV working on the seabed offloads data to a second AUV, which then surfaces and beams the data home to the research team using a satellite.\nThere’s also a system that enables AUVs to share information from seabed scans, and other data. So if an AUV surveying the seabed finds an intriguing object, it can share the coordinates of the object – that is, its position – with a nearby AUV that carries superior\ncameras (Q37)\n, and arrange for that AUV to make a closer inspection of the object.\nMarine archaeologists are excited about the huge potential of these AUVs for their discipline. One site where they’re going to be deployed is the Gulf of Baratti, off the Italian coast. In 1974, a 2,000-year-old Roman vessel was discovered here, in 18 metres of water. When it sank, it was carrying\nmedical (Q38)\ngoods, in wooden or tin receptacles. Its cargo gives us insight into the treatments available all those years ago, including tablets that are thought to have been dissolved to form a cleansing liquid for the\neyes (Q39)\n.\nOther Roman ships went down nearby, taking their cargoes with them. Some held huge pots made of terracotta. Some were used for transporting cargoes of olive oil, and others held\nwine (Q40)\n. In many cases it’s only these containers that remain, while the wooden ships have been buried under silt on the seabed.\nAnother project that’s about to …\n剑桥雅思14 Test4 Section4雅思听力答案\n31. spring\n32. tools\n33. maps\n34. heavy\n35. marble\n36. light\n37. camera(s)\n38. medical\n39. eyes\n40. wine"

This is Amber – you said to phone if I wanted to get more information about the job agency you mentioned. Is now a good time?\nWILLIAM:\nOh. hi Amber. Yes. Fine. So the agency I was talking about is called Bankside – they’re based in Docklands -I can tell you the address now -497 Eastside\nAMBER:\nOK. thanks. So is there anyone in particular I should speak to there?\nWILLIAM:\nThe agent I always deal with is called Becky Jamieson.\nAMBER:\nLet me write that down —Becky….\nWILLIAM:\nJamieson J-A-M-L-E-S-O-N (Q1)\n.\nAMBER:\nDo you have her direct line?\nWILLIAM:\nYes, it’s in my contacts somewhere -right, here we are: 078 double 6, 510 triple 3. I wouldn’t call her until the\nafternoon (Q2)\nif I were you – she’s always really busy in the morning trying to fill last-minute vacancies. She’s really helpful and friendly so I’m sure it would be worth getting in touch with her for an informal chat.\nAMBER:\nIt’s mainly clerical and admin jobs they deal with, isn’t it?\nWILLIAM:\nThat’s right. I know you’re hoping to find a full-time job in the media eventually. but Becky mostly recruits temporary staff for the finance sector – which will look good on your CV – and generally pays better too\nAMBER:\nYeah – I’m just a bit worried because I don’t have much office experience.\nWILLIAM:\nI wouldn’t worry. They’ll probably start you as a receptionist, or something like that. So what’s important for that kind of job isn’t so much having business skills or knowing lots of different computer systems – it’s\ncommunication (Q3)\nthat really matters – so you’d be fine there. And you’ll pick up office skills really quickly on the job. It’s not that complicated\nAMBER:\nOK good. So how long do people generally need temporary staff for? It would be great if l could get something lasting at least a month\nWILLIAM:\nThat shouldn’t be too difficult. But you’re more likely to be offered something for a\nweek (Q4)\nat first, which might get extended. It’s unusual to be sent somewhere for just a day or two.\nAMBER:\nRight. I’ve heard the pay isn’t too bad – better than working in a shop or a restaurant.\nWILLIAM:\nOh yes – definitely. The hourly rate is about\n£10 (Q5)\n, 11 if you’re lucky.\nAMBER:\nThat’s pretty good. I was only expecting to get eight or nine pounds an hour.\nWILLIAM:\nDo you want me to tell you anything about the registration process?\nAMBER:\nYes. please. I know you have to have an interview.\nWILLIAM:\nThe interview usually takes about an hour and you should arrange that about a week in advance\nAMBER:\nI suppose I should dress smartly if it’s for office work – I can probably borrow a\nsuit (Q6)\nfrom Mum.\nWILLIAM:\nGood idea, It’s better to look too smart than too casual\nAMBER:\nWill I need to bring copies of my exam certificates or anything like that?\nWILLIAM:\nNo – they don’t need to see those, I don’t think.\nAMBER:\nWhat about my\npassport (Q7)\n?\nWILLIAM:\nOh yes – they will ask to see that.\nAMBER:\nОK.\nWILLIAM:\nI wouldn’t get stressed about the interview though. It’s just a chance for them to build a relationship with you – so they can try and match you to a job which you’ll like.So there are questions about\npersonality (Q8)\nthat they always ask candidates fairly basic ones. And they probably won’t ask anything too difficult like what your plans are for the future\nAMBER:\nHope not\nWILLIAM:\nAnyway, there are lots of benefits to using an agency – for example, the interview will be useful because they’ll give you\nfeedback (Q9)\non your performance so you can improve next time.\nAMBER:\nAnd they’ll have access to jobs which aren’t advertised.\nWILLIAM:\nExactly – most temporary jobs aren’t advertised.\nAMBER:\nAnd I expect finding a temporary job this way takes a lot less\ntime (Q10)\n– it’s much easier than ringing up individual companies.\nWILLIAM:\nYes indeed.

My name’s Erica Matthews, and I’m the owner of Matthews Island Holidays, a company set up by my parents. Thank you for coming to this presentation, in which I hope to interest you in what we have to offer. We’re a small, family-run company, and we believe in the importance of the personal touch, so we don’t aim to compete with other companies on the number of customers. What we do is build on our\nmany years’ experience – more than almost any other rail holiday company (Q11)\n– to ensure we provide perfect holidays in a small number of destinations, which we’ve got to know extremely well.\nI’ll start with our six-day Isle of Man holiday. This is a fascinating island in the Irish Sea, with Wales to the south, England to the east, Scotland to the north and Northern Ireland to the west. Our holiday starts in\nHeysham, where your tour manager will meet you (Q12)\n, then you’ll travel by ferry to the Isle of Man. Some people prefer to fly from Luton instead, and another popular option is to go by train to Liverpool and take a ferry from there.\nYou have five nights in the hotel, and the price covers five breakfasts and dinners, and\nlunch on the three days when there are organised trips (Q13)\n: day four is free, and most people have lunch in a café or restaurant in Douglas.\nThe price of the holiday includes the ferry to the Isle of Man, all travel on the island, the hotel, and the meals I’ve mentioned. Incidentally, we try to make booking our holidays as simple and fair as possible, so unlike with many companies, the price is the same whether you book six months in advance or at the last minute, and there’s no supplement for single rooms in hotels.\nIf you make a booking then need to change the start date, for example because of illness, you’re welcome to change to an alternative date or a different tour, for a small administrative fee (Q14)\n.\nOK, so what does the holiday consist of? Well, on day one you’ll arrive in time for a short introduction by your tour manager, followed by dinner in the hotel. The dining room looks out at the\nriver (Q15)\n, close to where it flows into the harbour, and there’s usually plenty of activity going on.\nOn day two you’ll take the coach to the small town of Peel, on the way calling in at the Tynwald Exhibition. The Isle of Man isn’t part of the United Kingdom, and it has its own parliament, called Tynwald. It’s claimed that this is the world’s oldest parliament that’s still functioning and that it dates back to 979. However, the earliest surviving reference to it is from\n1422 (Q16)\n, so perhaps it isn’t quite as old as it claims!\nDay three we have a trip to the mountain Snaefell. This begins with a leisurely ride along the promenade in Douglas in a horse-drawn tram. Then you board an electric train which takes you to the fishing village of Laxey. From there it’s an eight-kilometre ride in the Snaefell Mountain Railway to the\ntop (Q17)\n. Lunch will be in the café, giving you spectacular views of the island.\nDay four is free for you to explore, using the\npass (Q18)\nwhich we’ll give you. So you won’t have to pay for travel on local transport, or for entrance to the island’s heritage sites. Or you might just want to take it easy in Douglas and perhaps do a little light shopping.\nThe last full day, day five, is for some people the highlight of the holiday, with a ride on the\nsteam (Q19)\nrailway, from Douglas to Port Erin. After some time to explore, a coach will take you to the headland that overlooks the Calf of Man, a small island just off the coast. From there you continue to Castletown, which used to be the\ncapital (Q20)\nof the Isle of Man, and its mediaeval castle.\nAnd on day six it’s back to the ferry – or the airport, if you flew to the island-and time to go home.\nNow I’d like to tell you …\n剑桥雅思15 Test1 Part2雅思听力答案\n11.

What we do is build on our many years’ experience – more than almost any other rail holiday company – to ensure we provide perfect holidays in a small number of destinations, which we’ve got to know extremely well.\n答案解析：原文中提到，该公司拥有多年的运营经验，比大多数其他的公司都要多。A选项longer对应more than，most对应almost any other，由此确定为正确答案。B选项和C选项的描述都与原文相反。该公司的顾客数量并不比其他公司多，而且目的地也少。\n第12题答案：B\n对应原文： Our holiday starts in Heysham, where your tour manager will meet you, then you’ll travel by ferry to the Isle of Man.\n答案解析：这道题比较简单一些，只要大家注意到题目问的是在哪里跟tour manager见面，就可以轻易锁定B选项Heysham。\n第13题答案：A\n对应原文：You have five nights in the hotel, and the price covers five breakfasts and dinners, and lunch on the three days when there are organised trips: day four is free\n答案解析：部分同学可能会将后面的day four is free理解成第四天是免费的（实际意思为：第四天是自由活动），因此认为午餐数量应该是3+1，即4顿。这里我们老烤鸭雅思暂且不讨论歧义的问题，因为考试中也来不及思考，只是跟大家普及一下雅思听力中的一个常识。雅思听力以考察同义替换和干扰项为主，极少极少极少需要大家自己计算，因此听到three就是3，不需要多此一举再算上后面的内容。\n第14题答案：C\n对应原文：If you make a booking then need to change the start date, for example because of illness, you’re welcome to change to an alternative date or a different tour, for a small administrative fee\n答案解析：雅思听力中十分常见的考察某个项目是否需要付费。根据a small administrative fee与前文change the start date的对应即可确定C为正确答案。\n第15题答案：river\n对应原文：The dining room looks out at the\nriver\n, close to where it flows into the harbour, and there’s usually plenty of activity going on.\n答案解析：从题干可以猜测出空上应该填具体的景色。dining room提示大家答案即将到来，很容易锁定river。\n第16题答案：1422\n对应原文：However, the earliest surviving reference to it is from\n1422\n, so perhaps it isn’t quite as old as it claims!\n答案解析：根据空后not 979可以猜测出空上应该填一个具体的年份，由此锁定1422。\n第17题答案：top\n对应原文：Then you board an electric train which takes you to the fishing village of Laxey. From there it’s an eight-kilometre ride in the Snaefell Mountain Railway to the\ntop\n答案解析：这道题的题干并没有给出什么多余的信息，只知道空上应该填一个名词，而且能够跟后面的地名组成的搭配。因此我们在听到Laxey之后将注意力放在名词身上，最终锁定top。\n第18题答案：pass\n对应原文：Day four is free for you to explore, using the\npass\nwhich we’ll give you.\n答案解析：采用语序颠倒的手法。将空前提示词provide对应的give放在了答案之后，有点考验大家的短期记忆能力。\n第19题答案：steam\n对应原文：The last full day, day five, is for some people the highlight of the holiday, with a ride on the\nsteam\nrailway\n答案解析：空后词railway原词出现，根据修饰关系很容易锁定答案为steam。\n第20题答案：capital\n对应原文： From there you continue to Castletown, which used to be the\ncapital\nof the Isle of Man\n答案解析：空前提示词former在原文中被替换为used to，根据修饰关系锁定答案为capital。"

From what I’ve been reading a lot of the claims about how your position in the family determines certain personality traits are just stereotypes, with no robust evidence to support them.\nRUTH:\nOK, but that’s an interesting point – we could start by outlining what previous research has shown. There are studies going back over a hundred years.\nED:\nYeah-so we could just run through some of the typical traits. Like the consensus seems to be that oldest children are generally less well-adjusted because they never get over the arrival of a younger sibling.\nRUTH:\nRight, but on a positive note, some studies claimed that\nthey were thought to be good at nurturing-certainly in the past when people had large families they would have been expected to look after the younger ones (Q21)\n.\nED:\nThere isn’t such a clear picture for middle children – but one trait that a lot of the studies mention is that they are easier to get on with than older or younger siblings.\nRUTH:\nGenerally eager to please and helpful (Q22)\n– although that’s certainly not accurate as far as my family goes – my middle brother was a nightmare-always causing fights and envious of whatever I had.\nED:\nAs I said – none of this seems to relate to my own experience. I’m the youngest in my family and I don’t recognise myself in any of the studies I’ve read about. I’m supposed to have been\na sociable and confident child who made friends easily (Q23)\n– but I was actually terribly shy.\nRUTH:\nReally? That’s funny. There have been hundreds of studies on twins but mostly about nurture versus nature…\nED:\nThere was one on personality, which said that a twin is likely to be\nquite shy in social situations (Q24)\nbecause they always have their twin around to depend on for support.\nRUTH:\nMy cousins were like that when they were small-they were only interested in each other and found it hard to engage with other kids.\nED:\nThey’re fine now though. Only children have had a really bad press – a lot of studies have branded them as\nloners who think the world revolves around them (Q25)\nbecause they’ve never had to fight for their parents’ attention.\nRUTH:\nThat does seem a bit harsh. One category I hadn’t considered before was children with much older siblings – a couple of studies mentioned that these children\ngrow up more quickly and are expected to do basic things for themselves-like getting dressed (Q26)\n.\nED:\nI can see how that might be true – although I expect they’re sometimes the exact opposite-playing the baby role and clamouring for special treatment.\nRUTH:\nWhat was the problem with most of these studies, do you think?\nED:\nI think it was because in a lot of cases data was collected from only one sibling per family, who rated him or herself and his or her siblings at the same time.\nRUTH:\nMmm. Some of the old research into the relationship between birth order and academic achievement has been proved to be accurate though. Performances in intelligence tests decline slightly from the eldest child to his or her younger siblings. This has been proved in lots of recent studies.\nED:\nYes.\nAlthough what many of them didn’t take into consideration was family size (Q27)\n. The more siblings there are, the likelier the family is to have a low socio-economic status -which can also account for differences between siblings in academic performance.\nRUTH:\nThe oldest boy might be given more opportunities than his younger sisters, for example.\nED:\nExactly.\nRUTH:\nBut the main reason for the marginally higher academic performance of oldest children is quite surprising, I think. It’s not only that they benefit intellectually from extra attention at a young age – which is what I would have expected.\nIt’s that they benefit from being teachers for their younger siblings, by verbalising processes (Q28)\n.\nED:\nRight, and this gives them status and confidence, which again contribute, in a small way, to better performance. So would you say sibling rivalry has been a useful thing for you?\nRUTH:\nI think so-my younger brother was incredibly annoying and we fought a lot but l think this has made me a stronger person.\nI know how to defend myself (Q29)\n. We had some terrible arguments and I would have died rather than apologise to him-but\nwe had to put up with each other (Q30)\nand most of the time we co-existed amicably enough.\nED:\nYes, my situation was pretty similar. But I don’t think having two older brothers made me any less selfish -I was never prepared to let my brothers use any of my stuff…\nRUTH:\nThat’s perfectly normal, whereas…\n剑桥雅思15 Test1 Part3雅思听力答案\n21.

This article is from Laokaoya website. It’s not only that they benefit intellectually from extra attention at a young age – which is what I would have expected. It’s that they benefit from being teachers for their younger siblings, by verbalising processes\n答案解析：选项A，B，C在原文中都有完整提到，因此我们只能根据题干中的限定条件和录音的描述逻辑去寻找答案。Ruth说的第一句话即对应B选项，但她表示是这一现象的原因让她惊讶，而非现象本身，因此排除B。C选项对应第二句话，但开头就有否定，因此也排除。最终确定A为正确答案。\n第29题答案：B\n对应原文：this has made me a stronger person. I know how to defend myself\n答案解析：这道多选并没有设置什么干扰项。Ruth提到她跟兄弟姐妹的争执让她变得更加强大，知道该如何保护自己。B选项stand up for oneself与defend myself同义替换，由此确定为正确答案。\n第30题答案：D\n对应原文：but we had to put up with each other and most of the time we co-existed amicably enough.\n答案解析：但与此同时，他们又不得不互相忍受彼此。D选项tolerant与put up with each other同义替换，由此确定为正确答案。"

This is a very common tree here in Australia, where it’s also sometimes called the gum tree. First I’m going to talk about why it’s important, then I’m going to describe some problems it faces at present.\nRight, well the eucalyptus tree is an important tree for lots of reasons. For example, it gives\nshelter (Q31)\nto creatures like birds and bats, and these and other species also depend on it for food, particularly the nectar from its flowers. So it supports biodiversity. It’s useful to us humans too, because we can kill germs with a disinfectant made from\noil (Q32)\nextracted from eucalyptus leaves.\nThe eucalyptus grows all over Australia and the trees can live for up to four hundred years. So it’s alarming that all across the country, numbers of eucalyptus are falling because the trees are dying off prematurely. So what are the reasons for this?\nOne possible reason is disease. As far back as the 1970s the trees started getting a disease called Mundulla Yellows. The trees’ leaves would gradually turn yellow, then the tree would die. It wasn’t until 2004 that they found the cause of the problem was lime, or calcium hydroxide to give it its proper chemical name, which was being used in the construction of\nroads (Q33)\n. The lime was being washed away into the ground and affecting the roots of the eucalyptus trees nearby. What it was doing was preventing the trees from sucking up the iron they needed for healthy growth. When this was injected back into the affected trees, they immediately recovered.\nBut this problem only affected a relatively small number of trees. By 2000, huge numbers of eucalyptus were dying along Australia’s East Coast, of a disease known as Bell-miner Associated Die-back. The bell-miner is a bird, and the disease seems to be common where there are high populations of bell-miners. Again it’s the leaves of the trees that are affected What happens is that\ninsects (Q34)\nsettle on the leaves and eat their way round them, destroying them as they go, and at the same time they secrete a solution which has sugar in it. The bell miner birds really like this solution, and in order to get as much as possible, they keep away other creatures that might try to get it. So these birds and insects flourish at the expense of other species, and eventually so much damage is done to the leaves that the tree dies.\nBut experts say that trees can start looking sick before any sign of Bell-miner Associated Dieback. So it looks as if the problem might have another explanation. One possibility is that it’s to do with the huge bushfires that we have in Australia. A theory proposed over 40 years ago by ecologist William Jackson is that the frequency of bushfires in a particular region affects the type of vegetation that grows there. If there are very frequent bushfires in a region, this encourages\ngrass (Q35)\nto grow afterwards, while if the bushfires are rather less frequent, this results in the growth of eucalyptus forests.\nSo why is this? Why do fairly frequent bushfires actually support the growth of eucalyptus? Well, one reason is that the fire stops the growth of other species which would consume\nwater (Q36)\nneeded by eucalyptus trees. And there’s another reason. If these other quick-growing species of bushes and plants are allowed to proliferate, they harm the eucalyptus in another way, by affecting the composition of the\nsoil (Q37)\n, and removing nutrients from it. So some bushfires are actually essential for the eucalyptus to survive as long as they are not too frequent. In fact there’s evidence that Australia’s indigenous people practised regular burning of bush land for thousands of years before the arrival of the Europeans.\nBut since Europeans arrived on the continent, the number of bushfires has been strictly controlled. Now scientists believe that this reduced frequency of bushfires to low levels has led to what’s known as ‘\ndry (Q38)\nrainforest’, which seems an odd name as usually we associate tropical rainforest with wet conditions. And what’s special about this type of rainforest? Well, unlike tropical rainforest which is a rich ecosystem, this type of ecosystem is usually a\nsimple (Q39)\none. It has very thick, dense vegetation, but not much variety of species. The vegetation provides lots of shade, so one species that does find it ideal is the bell-miner bird, which builds its\nnests (Q40)\nin the undergrowth there. But again that’s not helpful for the eucalyptus tree.\n剑桥雅思15 Test1 Part4雅思听力答案\n31. shelter\n32. oil\n33. roads\n34. insects\n35. grass(es)\n36. water\n37. soil\n38. dry\n39. simple\n40. nest(s)"

For example, it gives\nshelter\nto creatures like birds and bats\n答案解析：听到小标题对应的important意识到答案即将到来，空前词provides与gives同义替换，根据修饰关系锁定答案为shelter。\n第32题答案：oil\n对应原文：It’s useful to us humans too, because we can kill germs with a disinfectant made from\noil\nextracted from eucalyptus leaves.\n答案解析：不少同学可能不太认识题干末尾的disinfectant（杀菌剂），因此没有意识到它的提示作用。不过只要我们听到前面的too，就可以知道31题已经结束，录音进入32题。随后再根据词性和重读筛选出oil。\n第33题答案：roads\n对应原文：the cause of the problem was lime, or calcium hydroxide to give it its proper chemical name, which was being used in the construction of\nroads\n答案解析：这道题的难点主要在于跟32题的答案相隔太远，很容易让人怀疑自己是不是一不小心漏过去了。不过只要足够耐心等到lime，就很容易发现construction和空前词making的同义替换，进而锁定roads。\n第34题答案：insects\n对应原文：Again it’s the leaves of the trees that are affected What happens is that\ninsects\nsettle on the leaves and eat their way round them\n答案解析：同样又是隔了很多句废话才到34题。虽然这道题的提示词不太明显，但题干老烤鸭雅思问的是“什么东西吃这种树的叶子”，很容易猜到答案可能是虫子。听到insects之后确认之前的猜想，直接写答案就好。\n第35题答案：grass(es)\n对应原文： If there are very frequent bushfires in a region, this encourages\ngrass\nto grow afterwards\n答案解析：听到frequent bushfires意识到答案即将到来，空前词growth与grow词性替换，锁定grass为答案。\n第36题答案：water\n对应原文：Why do fairly frequent bushfires actually support the growth of eucalyptus? Well, one reason is that the fire stops the growth of other species which would consume\nwater\nneeded by eucalyptus trees\n答案解析：听到growth of eucalyptus意识到答案即将到来，这道题的空前修饰词more在原文中并没有很明显的同义替换，我们只能根据词性筛选出water来。\n第37题答案：soil\n对应原文：And there’s another reason. If these other quick-growing species of bushes and plants are allowed to proliferate, they harm the eucalyptus in another way, by affecting the composition of the\nsoil\n, and removing nutrients from it.\n答案解析：跟上一道题的出题方式比较类似，空前修饰词quality of在原文中同样没有明显的同义替换，只能在锁定句子之后，根据词性进行筛选。\n第38题答案：dry\n对应原文：Now scientists believe that this reduced frequency of bushfires to low levels has led to what’s known as ‘\ndry\nrainforest’\n答案解析：在连续两道稍有难度的题目之后，38题就简单许多。直接根据rainforest即可确定dry为正确答案。\n第39题答案：simple\n对应原文：unlike tropical rainforest which is a rich ecosystem, this type of ecosystem is usually a\nsimple\none\n答案解析：根据与ecosystem的修饰关系可以锁定rich和simple这两个单词，前者有否定，因此排除，确定simple为答案。\n第40题答案：nest(s)\n对应原文：he vegetation provides lots of shade, so one species that does find it ideal is the bell-miner bird, which builds its\nnests\nin the undergrowth there\n答案解析：考察所有格的同义替换，将题干中的of the bell-miner替换为its。因为提示词较为短小，比较考验大家听音辨音的能力。"

You’re through to the tourist information office, Tim speaking. How can I help you?\nJEAN:\nOh hello. Could you give me some information about next month’s festival, please? My family and I will be staying in the town that week.\nTIM:\nOf course. Well it starts with a concert on the afternoon of the 17th.\nJEAN:\nOh I heard about that. The orchestra and singers come from the USA. don’t they?\nTIM:\nThey’re from Canada. They’re very popular over there. They’re going to perform a number of well-known pieces that will appeal to children as well as adults That sounds good. My whole family are interested in music.\nTIM:\nThe next day, the 18th, there’s a performance by a ballet company called\nEustatis (Q1)\nJEAN:\nSorry?\nTIM:\nThe name is spelt E-U-S-T-A-T–S. They appeared in last year’s festival, and went down very well. Again, their programme is designed for all ages.\nJEAN:\nGood. I expect we’ll go to that. I hope there’s going to be a play during the festival, a comedy, ideally\nTIM:\nYou’re in luck! On the 19th and 20th a local amateur group are performing one written by a member of the group. It’s called Jemima. That’ll be on in the town hall. They’ve already performed it two or three times. I haven’t seen it myself, but the\nreview (Q2)\nin the local paper was very good\nJEAN:\nAnd is it suitable for children?\nTIM:\nYes, in fact it’s aimed more at children than at adults, so both performances are in the afternoon.\nJEAN:\nAnd what about\ndance (Q3)\n? Will there be any performances?\nTIM:\nYes, also on the 20th, but in the evening. A professional company is putting on a show of modern pieces, with electronic music by young composers\nJEAN:\nUh-huh.\nTIM:\nThe show is about how people communicate, or fail to communicate, with each other, so it’s got the rather strange name,\nChat (Q4)\n.\nJEAN:\nI suppose that’s because that’s something we do both face to face and online.\nTIM:\nThat’s right.\nTIM:\nNow there are also some workshops and other activities. They’ll all take place at least once every day, so everyone who wants to take part will have a chance.\nJEAN:\nGood. We’re particularly interested in cookery – you don’t happen to have a cookery workshop, do you?\nTIM:\nWe certainly do. It’s going to focus on how to make food part of a\nhealthy (Q5)\nlifestyle, and it’ll show that even sweet things like cakes can contain much less sugar than they usually do.\nJEAN:\nThat might be worth going to. We’re trying to encourage our children to cook\nTIM:\nAnother workshop is just for children, and that’s on creating\nposters (Q6)\nto reflect the history of the town. The aim is to make children aware of how both the town and people’s lives have changed over the centuries. The results will be exhibited in the community centre. Then the other workshop is in toy-making, and that’s for adults only.\nJEAN:\nOh, why’s that?\nTIM:\nBecause it involves carpentry – participants will be making toys out of\nwood (Q7)\n, so there’ll be a lot of sharp chisels and other tools around.\nJEAN:\nIt makes sense to keep children away from it.\nTIM:\nExactly. Now let me tell you about some of the outdoor activities. There’ll be supervised wild swimming …\nJEAN:\nWild swimming? What’s that?\nTIM:\nIt just means swimming in natural waters, rather than a swimming pool.\nJEAN:\nOh OK. In a\nlake (Q8)\n, for instance.\nTIM:\nYes, there’s a beautiful one just outside the town, and that’ll be the venue for the swimming. There’ll be lifeguards on duty, so it’s suitable for all ages. And finally, there’ll be a walk in some nearby woods every day. The leader is an expert on\ninsects (Q9)\n. He’ll show some that live in the woods, and how important they are for the environment. So there are going to be all sorts of different things to do during the festival.\nJEAN:\nThere certainly are.\nTIM:\nIf you’d like to read about how the preparations for the festival are going, the festival organiser is keeping a\nblog (10\n). Just search online for the festival website, and you’ll find it.\nJEAN:\nWell, thank you very much for all the information.\nTIM:\nYou’re welcome. Goodbye.\nJEAN:\nGoodbye.\n剑桥雅思15 Test2 Part1雅思听力答案\n1. Eustatis\n2. review\n3. dance\n4. Chat\n5. healthy\n6. posters\n7. wood\n8. lake\n9. insects\n10. blog"

Over to you, Mark.\nMARK:\nThank you. I’m sure you’re all familiar with Minster Park. It’s been a feature of the city for well over a century and has been the responsibility of the city council for most of that time. What perhaps isn’t so well known is the origin of the park:\nunlike many public parks that started in private ownership, as the garden of a large house, for instance, Minster was some waste land, which people living nearby started planting with flowers in 1892 (Q11)\n. It was unclear who actually owned the land, and this wasn’t settled until 20 years later, when the council took possession of it.\nYou may have noticed the statue near one of the entrances. It’s of Diane Gosforth, who played a key role in the history of the park. Once the council had become the legal owner, it planned to sell the land for housing. Many local people wanted it to remain a place that everyone could go to, to enjoy the fresh air and natural environment – remember the park is in a densely populated residential area.\nDiane Gosforth was one of those people, and she organised petitions and demonstrations (Q12)\n, which eventually made the council change its mind about the future of the land.\nSoon after this the First World War broke out, in 1914, and most of the park was dug up and\nplanted with vegetables (Q13)\n, which were sold locally. At one stage the army considered taking it over for troop exercises and got as far as contacting the city council, then decided the park was too small to be of use. There were occasional public meetings during the war, in an area that had been retained as grass.\nAfter the war, the park was turned back more or less to how it had been before 1914, and continued almost unchanged until recently. Plans for transforming it. were drawn up at various times, most recently in 2013, though they were revised in 2015, before any work had started.\nThe changes finally got going in 2016 (Q14)\n, and were finished on schedule last year.\nOK, let me tell you about some of the changes that have been made – and some things that have been retained. If you look at this map, you’ll see the familiar outline of the park, with the river forming the northern boundary, and a gate in each of the other three walls. The statue of Diane Gosforth has been moved: it used to be close to the south gate, but\nit’s now immediately to the north of the lily pond, almost in the centre of the park (Q15)\n, which makes it much more visible.\nThere’s a new area of wooden sculptures, which are\non the river bank, where the path from the east gate makes a sharp bend (Q16)\n.\nThere are two areas that are particularly intended for children. The playground has been enlarged and improved, and that’s\nbetween the river and the path that leads from the pond to the river (Q17)\n.\nThen there’s a new maze, a circular series of paths, separated by low hedges. That’s\nnear the west gate -you go north from there towards the river and then turn left to reach it (Q18)\n.\nThere have been tennis courts in the park for many years, and they’ve been doubled, from four to eight. They’re still\nin the south-west corner of the park, where there’s a right-angle bend in the path (Q19)\n.\nSomething else I’d like to mention is the new fitness area. This is\nright next to the lily pond on the same side as the west gate (Q20)\n.\nNow, as you’re all gardeners, I’m sure you’ll like to hear about the plants that have been chosen for the park.\n剑桥雅思15 Test2 Part2雅思听力答案\n11.

But we’ll have some people to help us find the materials and set it up,remember-for the moment, we just need to plan it.\nCATHY:\nGood. So have you gathered who’s expected to come and see the display? Is it for the people studying English, or students from other departments? I’m not clear about lL.\nGRAHAM:\nNor me. That was how it used to be, but it didn’t attract many people, so this year it’s going to be part of an open day, to raise the university’s profile.\nIt’ll be publicised in the city, to encourage people to come and find out something of what goes on here (Q21)\n. And it’s included in the information that’s sent to\npeople who are considering applying to study here next year (Q22)\n.\nCATHY:\nPresumably some current students and lecturers will come?\nGRAHAM:\nI would imagine so, but we’ve been told to concentrate on the other categories of people.\nCATHY:\nRight. We don’t have ta cover the whole range of 19th-century literature, do we?\nGRAHAM:\nNo, it’s entirely up to us. I suggest just using Charles Dickens.\nCATHY:\nThat’s a good idea.\nMost people have heard of him, and have probably read some of his novels, or seen films based on them (Q23)\n, so that’s a good lead-in to life in his time.\nGRAHAM:\nExactly.\nAnd his novels show the awful conditions that most people had to live in. don’t they: he wanted to shock people into doing something about it (Q24)\n.\nCATHY:\nDid he do any campaigning, other than writing?\nGRAHAM:\nYes, he campaigned for education and other social reforms, and gave talks, but I’m inclined to ignore that and focus on the novels.\nCATHY:\nYes, I agree.\nCATHY:\nOK, so now shall we think about a topic linked to each novel?\nGRAHAM:\nYes. I’ve printed out a list of Dickens’s novels in the order they were published, in the hope you’d agree to focus on him!\nCATHY:\nYou’re lucky I did agree! Let’s have a look.OK, the first was The Pickwick Papers, published in 1836. It was very successful when it came out, wasn’t it, and was adapted for the theatre straight away.\nGRAHAM:\nThere’s an interesting point, though, that there’s\na character who keeps falling asleep, and that medical condition was named after the book-Pickwickian Syndrome (Q25)\n.\nCATHY:\nOh, so why don’t we use that as the topic, and include some quotations from the novel?\nGRAHAM:\nRight. Next is Oliver Twist. There’s a lot in the novel about poverty. But maybe something less obvious…\nCATHY:\nWell Oliver is taught how to steal, isn’t he? We could use that to illustrate the fact that\nvery few children went to school, particularly not poor children, so they learnt in other ways (Q26)\n.\nGRAHAM:\nGood idea. What’s next?\nCATHY:\nMaybe Nicholas Nickleby. Actually, he taught in a really cruel school, didn’t he?\nGRAHAM:\nThat’s right. But there’s also the\ncompany of touring actors that Nicholas joins. We could do something on theatres and other amusements of the time (Q27)\n. We don’t want only the bad things, do we?\nCATHY:\nOK.\nGRAHAM:\nWhat about Martin Chuzzlewit? He goes to the USA, doesn’t he?\nCATHY:\nYes, and\nDickens himself had been there a year before and drew on his experience there in the novel (Q28)\n.\nGRAHAM:\nI wonder, though … The main theme is selfishness, so we could do something on social justice? No, too general, let’s keep to your idea-I think it would work well.\nCATHY:\nHe wrote Bleak House next – that’s my favourite of his novels.\nGRAHAM:\nYes, mine too. His satire of the legal system is pretty powerful.\nCATHY:\nThat’s true, but think about Esther,\nthe heroine. As a child she lives with someone she doesn’t know is her aunt. who treats her very badly. Then she’s very happy living with her guardian, and he puts her in charge of the household. And at the end she gets married and her guardian gives her and her husband a house. where of course they’re very happy (Q29)\n.\nGRAHAM:\nYes, I like that.\nCATHY:\nWhat shall we take next? Litle Domit? Old Mr Dorrit has been in a debtors’ prison for years…\nGRAHAM:\nSo was Dickens’s father, wasn’t he?\nCATHY:\nThat’s right.\nGRAHAM:\nWhat about focusing on\nthe part when Mr Dorrit inherits a fortune, and he starts pretending he’s always been rich (Q30)\n?\nCATHY:\nGood idea.\nGRAHAM:\nOK, so next we need to think about what materials we want to illustrate each issue. That’s going to be quite hard.\n剑桥雅思15 Test2 Part3雅思听力答案\n21-22. BD\n23-24. BC\n25. G\n26. B\n27. D\n28. C\n29. H\n30. F"

We could do something on theatres and other amusements of the time\n答案解析：两名学生打算利用Nicholas Nickleby这部小说说明当时的剧院情况和其他娱乐项目。D选项entertainment与amusements同义替换，由此确定它为正确答案。\n第28题答案：C\n对应原文：Dickens himself had been there a year before and drew on his experience there in the novel\n答案解析：Martin Chuzzlewit这部小说中有狄更斯自己经历的影子，由此确定C为正确答案。\n第29题答案：H\n对应原文：As a child she lives with someone she doesn’t know is her aunt. who treats her very badly. Then she’s very happy living with her guardian, and he puts her in charge of the household. And at the end she gets married and her guardian gives her and her husband a house. where of course they’re very happy\n答案解析：录音中直接描述了Bleak house女主的人生经历，很容易锁定H为正确答案。\n第30题答案：F\n对应原文：What about focusing on the part when Mr Dorrit inherits a fortune, and he starts pretending he’s always been rich\n答案解析：虽然这句话听起来可能稍微有点绕，但题目还是比较简单的。无论是根据fortune还是rich都可以确定F wealth为正确答案。"

This is a dry and arid region, with unpredictable rainfall. Because of this, people in the area were unable to support themselves through agriculture and instead they used the forest as a means of providing themselves with an income, mainly by selling charcoal. However, this was not a sustainable way of living in the long term, as they were rapidly using up this resource.\nTo support agriculture in this dry region, the programme focused primarily on making use of existing water resources from the Limpopo River by setting up systems of\nirrigation (Q31)\n, which would provide a dependable water supply for crops and animals. The programme worked closely with the district government in order to find the best way of implementing this. The region already had one farmers’ association, and it was decided to set up two more of these. These associations planned and carried out activities including water management, livestock breeding and agriculture, and it was notable that in general,\nwomen (Q32)\nformed the majority of the workforce.\nIt was decided that in order to keep the crops safe from animals, both wild and domestic, special areas should be fenced off where the crops could be grown. The community was responsible for creating these fences, but the programme provided the necessary\nwire (Q33)\nfor making them.\nOnce the area had been fenced off, it could be cultivated. The land was dug, so that vegetables and cereals appropriate to the climate could be grown, and the programme provided the necessary\nseeds (Q34)\nfor this. The programme also provided pumps so that water could be brought from the river in pipes to the fields. However, the labour was all provided by local people, and they also provided and put up the\nposts (Q35)\nthat supported the fences around the fields.\nOnce the programme had been set up, its development was monitored carefully. The farmers were able to grow enough produce not just for their own needs, but also to sell. However, getting the produce to places where it could be marketed was sometimes a problem, as the farmers did not have access to\ntransport (Q36)\n, and this resulted in large amounts of produce, especially vegetables, being spoiled. This problem was discussed with the farmers’ associations and it was decided that in order to prevent food from being spoiled, the farmers needed to learn techniques for its\npreservation (Q37)\n.\nThere was also an additional initiative that had not been originally planned,but which became a central feature of the programme. This was when farmers started to dig holes for tanks in the fenced-off areas and to fill these with water and use them for breeding\nfish (Q38)\n– an important source of protein. After a time, another suggestion was made by local people which hadn’t been part of the programme’s original proposal, but which was also adopted later on. They decided to try setting up colonies of\nbees\n(Q39)\n, which would provide honey both for their own consumption and to sell.\nSo what lessons can be learned from this programme? First of all, it tells us that in dry, arid regions, if there is access to a reliable source of water, there is great potential for the development of agriculture. In Chicualacuala, there was a marked improvement in agricultural production, which improved food security and benefited local people by providing them with both food and income. However, it’s important to set realistic timelines for each phase of the programme, especially for its\ndesign (Q40)\n, as mistakes made at this stage may be hard to correct later on.\nThe programme demonstrates that sustainable development is possible in areas where …\n剑桥雅思15 Test2 Part4雅思听力答案\n31. irrigation\n32. women\n33. wire(s)\n34. seed(s)\n35. posts\n36. transport\n37. preservation\n38. fish(es)\n39. bees\n40. design"

The only thing is, you said they were in North London so it would be quite a long commute for me.\nSALLY:\nOK.\nSALLY:\nSo the second position might suit you better as far as the location goes; that’s for a warehouse assistant and that’s in South London.\nJOE:\nYes, that would be a lot closer.\nSALLY:\nAnd you’ve worked in a warehouse before, haven’t you?\nJOE:\nYes.\nSALLY:\nSo as far as the responsibilities for this position go, they want someone who can manage the stock, obviously, and also\ndeliveries (Q6)\n.\nJOE:\nThat should be OK. You’ve got to keep track of stuff, but I’ve always been quite good with numbers.\nSALLY:\nGood. That’s their first requirement. And they want someone who’s computer literate, which we know you are.\nJOE:\nSure.\nSALLY:\nThen they mention organisational skills. They want someone who’s well organised.\nJOE:\nYes, I think l am.\nSALLY:\nAnd\ntidy (Q7)\n?\nJOE:\nYes, they go together really, don’t they?\nSALLY:\nSure. Then the usual stuff; they want someone who can communicate well both orally and in writing.\nJOE:\nOK. And for the last warehouse job I had, one of the things | enjoyed most was being part of a\nteam (Q8)\n. I found that was really essential for the job.\nSALLY:\nExcellent. Yes, they do mention that they want someone who’s used to that, yes. Now when you were working in a warehouse last time, what sorts of items were you dealing with?\nJOE:\nIt was mostly bathroom and kitchen equipment, sinks and stoves and fridges.\nSALLY:\nSo you’re OK moving\nheavy (Q9)\nthings?\nJOE:\nSure. I’m quite strong, and I’ve had the training.\nSALLY:\nGood. Now as far as experience goes, they mention they want someone with a licence, and that you have experience of driving in London so you can cope with the traffic and so on.\nJOE:\nYes, no problem.\nSALLY:\nAnd you’ve got experience of warehouse work … and the final thing they mention is\ncustomer (Q10)\nservice. I think looking at your CV you’re OK there.\nJOE:\nRight. So what about pay? Can you tell me a bit more about that, please …\n剑桥雅思15 Test3 Part1雅思听力答案\n1. furniture\n2. meetings\n3. diary\n4. detail(s)\n5. 1/one year\n6. deliveries\n7. tidy\n8. team\n9. heavy\n10. customer"

For those of you that don’t already know – Street Play involves local residents closing off their street for a few hours so that children have a chance to play in the street safely. She started it in her own street, Beechwood Road, and the idea caught on, and there are now Street Play Schemes all over the city. So when did you actually start the scheme, Alice?\nALICE:\nWell, I first had the idea when my oldest child was still a toddler, so that’s about six years ago now – but it took at least two years of campaigning before we were actually able to make it happen.\nSo the scheme’s been up and running for three years now (Q11)\n. We’d love to be able to close our road for longer – for the whole weekend, from Saturday morning until Sunday evening, for example.\nAt the moment it’s just once a week (Q12)\n. But when we started it was only once a month. But we’re working on it.\nPRESENTER:\nSo what actually happens when Beechwood Road is closed?\nALICE:\nWe have\nvolunteer wardens, mostly parents but some elderly residents too, who block off our road at either end (Q13)\n. The council have provided special signs but there’s always a volunteer there to explain what’s happening to any motorists. Generally, they’re fine about it – we’ve only had to get the police involved once or twice.\nNow I should explain that the road isn’t completely closed to cars. But only residents’ cars are allowed. If people really need to get in or out of Beechwood Road, it’s not a problem-\nas long as they drive at under 20 kilometres per hour (Q14)\n. But most people just decide not to use their cars during this time, or they park in another street. The wardens are only there to stop through traffic.\nPRESENTER:\nSo can anyone apply to get involved in Street Play?\nALICE:\nAbsolutely -we want to include all kids\nin the city – especially those who live on busy roads (Q15)\n. It’s here that demand is greatest. Obviously, there isn’t such demand in wealthier areas where the children have access to parks or large gardens-or in the suburbs where there are usually more places for children to play outside.\nI’d recommend that anyone listening who likes the idea should just give it a go. We’ve been surprised by the positive reaction of residents all over the city. And that’s not just parents. There are always a few who complain but they’re a tiny minority. On the whole everyone is very supportive and say\nthey’re very happy to see children out on the street (Q16)\n– even if it does get quite noisy.\nThere have been so many benefits of Street Play for the kids. Parents really like the fact that the kids are getting fresh air instead of sitting staring at a computer screen, even if they’re not doing anything particularly energetic. And of course it’s great that kids can play with their friends outside without being supervised by their parents- but for me the biggest advantage is that kids\ndevelop confidence in themselves to be outside without their parents (Q17)\n. The other really fantastic thing is that children get\nto know the adults in the street – it’s like having a big extended family (Q18)\n.\nPRESENTER:\nIt certainly does have a lot of benefits. I want to move on now and ask you about a related project in King Street.\nALICE:\nRight.Well, this was an experiment I was involved in where local residents decided to try and reduce the traffic along King Street, which is the busiest main road in our area, by persuading people not to use their cars for one day. We thought about making people pay more for parking-but we decided that would be really unpopular-so instead we just stopped people from parking on King Street but left the other car parks open.\nIt was surprising how much of a difference all this made. As we’d predicted, air quality was significantly better but what I hadn’t expected was\nhow much quieter it would be (Q19)\n– even with the buses still running. Of course everyone said they felt safer but we were actually amazed that\nsales in the shops went up considerably that day (Q20)\n– we thought there’d be fewer people out shopping-not more.\nPRESENTER:\nThat’s really interesting so the fact that.\n剑桥雅思15 Test3 Part2雅思听力答案\n11.

But when we started it was only once a month. But we’re working on it.\n答案解析：目前是一周一次，刚开始的时候是一个月一次。因为题干中有now的限定，因此确定A为正确答案。\n第13题答案：C\n对应原文：We have volunteer wardens, mostly parents but some elderly residents too, who block off our road at either end. The council have provided special signs …  we’ve only had to get the police involved once or twice.\n答案解析：大多数情况都是由父母和老年人充当的志愿者来封锁道路。当地委员会只是提供了特殊的标志，而警察也只是偶尔一两次出现。由此答案应该为C。\n第14题答案：B\n对应原文：as long as they drive at under 20 kilometres per hour. This is from Laokaoya website. But most people just decide not to use their cars during this time, or they park in another street.\n答案解析：C选项在原文中完全没有对应。B选项对应under 20 kilometres per hour，而A选项则是不用车的情况，由此确定B为正确答案。\n第15题答案：C\n对应原文：we want to include all kids in the city – especially those who live on busy roads. It’s here that demand is greatest.\n答案解析：原文中明确指出，在繁忙道路附近的需求最大，由此确定C为正确答案。而富裕地区和郊外都不怎么需要这一方案。\n第16题答案：B\n对应原文：On the whole everyone is very supportive and say they’re very happy to see children out on the street\n答案解析：B选项与原文相比几乎没有进行什么替换。A选项错在many，而C选项则错在lack of noise。\n第17题答案：B\n对应原文：but for me the biggest advantage is that kids develop confidence in themselves to be outside without their parents\n答案解析：原文中其实提到了很多好处，但因为题干上有most important的限定，因此我们得听到the biggest advantage之后才能锁定答案。develop confidence in themselves与increased sense of independence对应，由此确定B为正确答案。\n第18题答案：D\n对应原文：the other really fantastic thing is that children get to know the adults in the street – it’s like having a big extended family\n答案解析：另外一项巨大的好处在于，孩子得以认识街区的其他成人，就像拥有一个大家庭一样。选项中与此描述最为接近的只有D，由此确定为正确答案。\n第19题答案：A\n对应原文： Of course everyone said they felt safer but we were actually amazed that sales in the shops went up considerably that day\n答案解析：B选项safety在原文中虽然也有提到，但并没有任何能够跟题干上surprise对应的地方，因此排除。A选项与sales in the shops went up对应，而且同一句话中也有amazed，由此确定它为正确答案。\n第20题答案：E\n对应原文：As we’d predicted, air quality was significantly better but what I hadn’t expected was how much quieter it would be\n答案解析：C选项空气污染的减少是意料之中的，而变得如此安静则是意料之外的，由此确定E，排除C。"

What’s it about?\nHAZEL:\nIt’s my first media studies assignment, and I’m not sure how to go about it. You must have done it last year.\nTOM:\nIs that the one comparing the coverage of a particular story in a range of newspapers?\nHAZEL:\nThat’s right.\nTOM:\nOh yes, I really enjoyed writing it.\nHAZEL:\nSo what sort of things do I need to compare?\nTOM:\nWell, there are several things. For example, there’s the question of which\npage (Q21)\nof the newspaper the item appears on.\nHAZEL:\nYou mean, because there’s a big difference between having it on the front page and the bottom of page ten, for instance?\nTOM:\nExactly. And that shows how important the editor thinks the story is. Then there’s the\nsize (Q22\n)\n– how many column inches the story is given, how many columns it spreads over.\nHAZEL:\nAnd I suppose that includes the headline\nTOM:\nIt certainly does. It’s all part of attracting the reader’s attention.\nHAZEL:\nWhat about\ngraphics (Q23)\n– whether there’s anything visual in addition to the text?\nTOM:\nYes, you need to consider those, too, because they can have a big effect on the reader’s understanding of the story – sometimes a bigger effect than the text itself. Then you’ll need to look at how the item is put together: what\nstructure (Q24)\nis it given? Bear in mind that not many people read beyond the first paragraph so what has the journalist put at the beginning? And if, say, there are conflicting opinions about something, does one appear near the end, where people probably won’t read it?\nHAZEL:\nAnd newspapers sometimes give wrong or misleading information, don’t they? Either deliberately or by accident. Should I be looking at that, too?\nTOM:\nYes, if you can. Compare what’s in different versions, and as far as possible, try and work out what’s true and what isn’t. And that relates to a very important point: what’s the writer’s\npurpose (Q25)\n, or at least the most important one, if they have several. It may seem to be to inform the public, but often it’s that they want to create fear, or controversy, or to make somebody look ridiculous\nHAZEL:\nGosh, I see what you mean. And I suppose the writer may make\nassumptions (Q26)\nabout the reader.\nTOM:\nThat’s right – about their knowledge of the subject, their attitudes, and their level of education, which means writing so that the readers understand without feeling patronised. All of that will make a difference to how the story is presented.\nHAZEL:\nDoes it matter what type of story I write about?\nTOM:\nNo – national or international politics, the arts … Anything, as long as it’s covered in two or three newspapers. Though of course it’ll be easier and more fun if it’s something you’re interested in and know something about.\nHAZEL:\nAnd on that basis a national news item would be worth analysing-I’m quite keen on politics,\nso I’ll try and find a suitable topic (Q27)\n. What did you choose for your analysis, Tom?\nTOM:\nI was interested in how newspapers express their opinions explicitly, so\nI wanted to compare editorials in different papers, but when I started looking, I couldn’t find two on the same topic (Q28)\nthat I felt like analysing.\nHAZEL:\nIn that case, I won’t even bother to look.\nTOM:\nSo in the end I chose a human interest story – a terribly emotional story about a young girl who was very ill, and lots of other people – mostly strangers – raised money so she could go abroad for treatment. Actually, I was surprised – some papers just wrote about how wonderful everyone was, but others considered the broader picture, like why treatment wasn’t available here.\nHAZEL:\nHmm,\nI usually find stories like that raise quite strong feelings in me! I’ll avoid that (Q29)\n.\nPerhaps I’ll choose an arts topic (Q30)\n, like different reviews of a film, or something about funding for the arts – I’ll think about that.\nTOM:\nYes, that might be interesting.\nHAZEL:\nOK, well thanks a lot for your help, Tom. It’s been really useful.\nTOM:\nYou’re welcome. Good luck with the assignment, Hazel.\n剑桥雅思15 Test3 Part3雅思听力答案\n21. page\n22. size\n23. graphic(s)\n24. structure\n25. purpose\n26. assumption(s)\n27.

Since water is essential for life, the earliest people lived near water and knew something about its cleansing properties – at least that it rinsed\nmud (Q31)\noff their hands.\nDuring the excavation of ancient Babylon, evidence was found that soapmaking was known as early as 2800 BC. Archaeologists discovered cylinders made of\nclay (Q32)\n, with inscriptions on them saying that fats were boiled with ashes. This is a method of making soap, though there’s no reference to the purpose of this material\nThe early Greeks bathed for aesthetic reasons and apparently didn’t use soap. Instead, they cleaned their bodies with blocks of sand, pumice and ashes, then anointed themselves with oil, and scraped off the oil and dirt with a\nmetal (Q33)\ninstrument known as a strigil. They also used oil mixed with ashes. Clothes were washed without soap in streams.\nThe ancient Germans and Gauls are also credited with discovering how to make a substance called ‘soap’, made of melted animal fat and ashes. They used this mixture to tint their\nhair (Q34)\nred.\nSoap got its name, according to an ancient Roman legend, from Mount Sapo, where animals were sacrificed, leaving deposits of animal fat. Rain washed these deposits, along with wood ashes, down into the clay soil along the River Tiber. Women found that this mixture greatly reduced the effort required to wash their clothes.\nAs Roman civilisation advanced, so did bathing. The first of the famous Roman\nbaths (Q35)\n, supplied with water from their aqueducts, was built around 312 BC. The baths were luxurious, and bathing became very popular. And by the second century AD, the Greek physician Galen recommended soap for both medicinal and cleansing purposes.\nAfter the fall of Rome in 467 AD and the resulting decline in bathing habits, much of Europe felt the impact of filth on public health. This lack of personal cleanliness and related unsanitary living conditions were major factors in the outbreaks of\ndisease (Q36)\nin the Middle Ages,and especially the Black Death of the 14th century.\nNevertheless, soapmaking became an established craft in Europe, and associations of soapmakers guarded their trade secrets closely. Vegetable and animal oils were used with ashes of plants, along with\nperfume (Q37)\n, apparently for the first time. Gradually more varieties of soap became available for shaving and shampooing, as well as bathing and laundering.\nA major step toward large-scale commercial soapmaking occurred in 1791, when a French chemist, Nicholas Leblanc, patented a process for turning\nsalt (Q38)\ninto soda ash, or sodium carbonate. Soda ash is the alkali obtained from ashes that combines with fat to form soap. The Leblanc process yielded quantities of good-quality, inexpensive soda ash.\nModern soapmaking was born some 20 years later, in the early 19th century, with the discovery by Michel Eugène Chevreul, another French chemist, of the chemical nature and relationship of fats, glycerine and fatty acids. His studies established the basis for both fat and soap chemistry, and soapmaking became a\nscience (Q39)\n. Further developments during the 19th century made it easier and cheaper to manufacture soap.\nUntil the 19th century, soap was regarded as a luxury item, and was heavily taxed in several countries. As it became more readily available, it became an everyday necessity, a development that was reinforced when the high\ntax (Q40)\nwas removed. Soap was then something ordinary people could afford, and cleanliness standards improved.\nWith this widespread use came the development of milder soaps for bathing and soaps for use in the washing machines that were available to consumers by the turn of the 20th century.\n剑桥雅思15 Test3 Part4雅思听力答案\n31. mud\n32. clay\n33. metal\n34. hair\n35. bath(s)\n36. disease(s)\n37. perfume\n38. salt\n39. science\n40. tax"

Archaeologists discovered cylinders made of\nclay\n答案解析：听到soap意识到答案即将到来。原文进行了小小的语序颠倒，将本来位于空后的cylinders放在了答案之前，一定程度上降低了题目难度。\n第33题答案：metal\n对应原文：Instead, they cleaned their bodies with blocks of sand, pumice and ashes, then anointed themselves with oil, and scraped off the oil and dirt with a\nmetal\ninstrument known as a strigil\n答案解析：从题干可以推测出空上应该填某种具体的材料，听到scrap意识到答案即将到来，根据事先猜测锁定metal。\n第34题答案：hair\n对应原文：discovering how to make a substance called ‘soap’, made of melted animal fat and ashes. They used this mixture to tint their\nhair\nred.\n答案解析：题干中的colour为动词形式，表示给什么染色的意思，在老烤鸭雅思原文中被替换为tint，根据修饰关系确定hair为正确答案。\n第35题答案：bath(s)\n对应原文：As Roman civilisation advanced, so did bathing. The first of the famous Roman\nbaths\n, supplied with water from their aqueducts, was built around 312 BC\n答案解析：这道题的难点有两个：一是Roman多次出现，容易让人惊慌不定。二是将312BC这一具体的年份放在了答案之后，比较考验大家的短期记忆能力。\n第36题答案：disease(s)\n对应原文：This lack of personal cleanliness and related unsanitary living conditions were major factors in the outbreaks of\ndisease\nin the Middle Ages\n答案解析：听到前文中的decline意识到答案即将到来，occurrence与outbreaks同义替换，根据修饰关系锁定disease。\n第37题答案：perfume\n对应原文： Vegetable and animal oils were used with ashes of plants, along with\nperfume\n, apparently for the first time.\n答案解析：一些同学可能会认为前面的vegetable, animal oils或者ashes也可以作为答案。但它们制成的是肥皂本身，而不是添加物。\n第38题答案：salt\n对应原文：a French chemist, Nicholas Leblanc, patented a process for turning\nsalt\ninto soda ash, or sodium carbonate.\n答案解析：从题干可以推测空上应该填某种原材料。听到Leblanc意识到答案即将到来，根据含义锁定salt。\n第39题答案：science\n对应原文：His studies established the basis for both fat and soap chemistry, and soapmaking became a\nscience\n答案解析：听到Chevreul意识到答案即将到来，turn into与became同义替换，由此确定science为正确答案。\n第40题答案：tax\n对应原文： it became an everyday necessity, a development that was reinforced when the high\ntax\nwas removed.\n答案解析：空前词no longer与removed同义替换，根据修饰关系，确定答案为tax。"

Do you mind if I ask you some questions about your journey today? We’re doing a customer satisfaction survey.\nSOPHIE:\nYes. OK. I’ve got about ten minutes before my train home leaves. I’m on a day trip.\nMAN:\nGreat.Thank you. So first of all, could you tell me your name?\nSOPHIE:\nIt’s Sophie Bird.\nMAN:\nThank you. And would you mind telling me what you do?\nSOPHIE:\nI’m a\njournalist (Q1)\n.\nMAN:\nOh really? That must be interesting.\nSOPHIE:\nYes. It is.\nMAN:\nSo was the reason for your visit here today work?\nSOPHIE:\nActually, it’s my day off. I came here to do some\nshopping (Q2)\n.\nMAN:\nOh right.\nSOPHIE:\nBut I do sometimes come here for work.\nMAN:\nOK. Now I’d like to ask some questions about your journey today, if that’s OK.\nSOPHIE:\nYes.No problem.\nMAN:\nRight, so can you tell me which station you’re travelling back to?\nSOPHIE:\nStaunfirth (Q3)\n, where I live.\nMAN:\nCan I just check the spelling? S-T-A-U-N-F-I-R-T-H?\nSOPHIE:\nThat’s right.\nMAN:\nAnd you travelled from there this morning?\nSOPHIE:\nYes.\nMAN:\nOK, good. Next, can l ask what kind of ticket you bought? I assume it wasn’t a season ticket, as you don’t travel every day.\nSOPHIE:\nThat’s right. No, I just got a normal\nreturn (Q4)\nticket. I don’t have a rail card so I didn’t get any discount. I keep meaning to get one because it’s a lot cheaper.\nMAN:\nYes – you’d have saved 20% on your ticket today. So you paid the full price for your ticket?\nSOPHIE:\nI paid\n£23.70 (Q5)\n.\nMAN:\nOK. Do you think that’s good value for money?\nSOPHIE:\nNot really. I think it’s too much for a journey that only takes 45 minutes.\nMAN:\nYes, that’s one of the main complaints we get. So, you didn’t buy your ticket in advance?\nSOPHIE:\nNo. I know it’s cheaper if you buy a week in advance but I didn’t know I was coming then.\nMAN:\nI know. You can’t always plan ahead. So, did you buy it this morning?\nSOPHIE:\nNo, it was yesterday.\nMAN:\nRight. And do you usually buy your tickets at the station?\nSOPHIE:\nWell, I do usually but the ticket office closes early and I hate using ticket machines. I think ticket offices should be open for longer hours, There’s always a queue for the machines and they’re often out of order.\nMAN:\nA lot of customers are saying the same thing.\nSOPHIE:\nSo to answer your question…l got an e-ticket\nonline (Q6)\n.\nMAN:\nOK. Thank you. Now I’d like to ask you about your satisfaction with your journey. So what would you say you were most satisfied with today?\nSOPHIE:\nWell, I like the wifi on the train. It’s improved a lot. It makes it easier for me to work if I want to.\nMAN:\nThat’s the first time today anyone’s mentioned that. It’s good to get some positive feedback on that.\nSOPHIE:\nMmm\nMAN:\nAnd, is there anything you weren’t satisfied with?\nSOPHIE:\nWell, normally, the trains run on time and are pretty reliable but today there was a\ndelay (Q7)\n; the train was about 15 minutes behind schedule.\nMAN:\nOK. I’ll put that down. Now I’d also like to ask about the facilities at this station. You’ve probably noticed that the whole station’s been upgraded. What are you most satisfied with?\nSOPHIE:\nI think the best thing is that they’ve improved the amount of\ninformation (Q8)\nabout train times etc. that’s given to passengers -it’s much clearer-before there was only one board and I couldn’t always see it properly-which was frustrating.\nMAN:\nThat’s good. And is there anything you’re not satisfied with?\nSOPHIE:\nLet’s see… I think things have generally improved a lot. The trains are much more modern and I like the new café. But one thing is that there aren’t enough places to sit down, especially on the\nplatforms (Q9)\n.\nMAN:\nOK – so I’ll put ‘seating’ down, shall I, as the thing you’re least satisfied with?\nSOPHIE:\nYes. OK\nMAN:\nCan I ask your opinion about some of the other facilities? We’d like feedback on whether people are satisfied, dissatisfied or neither satisfied nor dissatisfied.\nSOPHIE:\nОK.\nMAN:\nWhat about the\nparking (Q10)\nat the station?\nSOPHIE:\nWell to be honest, I don’t really have an opinion as I never use it.\nMAN:\nSo, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied for that then.\nSOPHIE:\nYes, I suppose so…\nMAN:\nOK, and what about…?\n剑桥雅思15 Test4 Part1雅思听力答案\n1. journalist\n2. shoppinig\n3.

So if you could. just take a look at the map I handed out, let’s begin with a general overview. So the basic arrangement of the park hasn’t changed -it still has two gates, north and south, and a lake in the middle.\nThe café continues to serve an assortment of drinks and snacks and is still in the same place,\nlooking out over the lake and next to the old museum (Q11)\n.\nWe’re hoping to change the location of the toilets, and bring them nearer to the centre of the park as they’re a bit out of the way at present,\nnear the adventure playground, in the corner of your map (Q12)\n.\nThe formal gardens have been replanted and should be at their best in a month or two. They used to be behind the old museum, but we’ve now used\nthe space near the south gate – between the park boundary and the path that goes past the lake towards the old museum (Q13)\n.\nWe have a new outdoor gym for adults and children, which is already proving very popular It’s\nby the glass houses, just to the right of the path from the south gate. You have to look for it as it’s a bit hidden in the trees (Q14)\n.\nOne very successful introduction has been our skateboard ramp. It’s in constant use during the evenings and holidays. It’s\nnear the old museum, at the end of a little path that leads off from the main path between the lake and the museum (Q15)\n.\nWe’ve also introduced a new area for wild flowers, to attract bees and butterflies. It’s\non a bend in the path that goes round the east side of the lake, just south of the adventure playground (Q16)\n.\nNow let me tell you a bit more about some of the changes to Croft Valley Park.\nOne of our most exciting developments has been the adventure playground. We were aware that we had nowhere for children to let off steam, and decided to use our available funds to set up a completely new facility in a large space to the north of the park. It’s open year-round, though it closes early in the winter months, and\nentrance is completely free (Q17)\n. Children can choose whatever activities they want to do, irrespective of their age, but\nwe do ask adults not to leave them on their own there (Q18)\n. There are plenty of seats where parents can relax and keep an eye on their children at the same time.\nLastly, the glass houses. A huge amount of work has been done on them to repair the\ndamage following the disastrous fire that recently destroyed their western side (Q19)\n. Over £80,000 was spent on replacing the glass walls and the metal supports, as well as the plants that had been destroyed, although unfortunately, the collection of tropical palm trees has proved too expensive to replace up to now. At present the glass houses are open from 10am to 3pm\nMondays to Thursdays, and it’s hoped to extend this to the weekend soon (Q20)\n. We’re grateful to all those who helped us by contributing their time and money to this achievement.\nThe gardens have…\n剑桥雅思15 Test4 Part2雅思听力答案\n11. D\n12. C\n13. G\n14. H\n15. A\n16. E\n17-18.

You have to look for it as it’s a bit hidden in the trees\n答案解析：户外健身器械位于玻璃房附近，由南门而来的道路右边。需要仔细找一下，因为它藏在树丛里。根据前面的描述，我们将目光锁定F和H，再根据trees确定H为答案。\n第15题答案：A\n对应原文：It’s near the old museum, at the end of a little path that leads off from the main path between the lake and the museum\n答案解析：滑道位于老博物馆附近，由主路分叉出来的小路尽头，由此确定A为正确答案。\n第16题答案：E\n对应原文：It’s on a bend in the path that goes round the east side of the lake, just south of the adventure playground\n答案解析：野花位于环湖小路的转弯处，冒险游乐区的南边。很容易确定E为正确答案。\n第17题答案：A\n对应原文：but we do ask adults not to leave them on their own there\n答案解析：原文中提到，家长不要留孩子一个人在那里，即孩子需要在家长的监管下玩耍，由此确定A为正确答案。\n第18题答案：D\n对应原文：It’s open year-round, though it closes early in the winter months, and entrance is completely free\n答案解析：该区域全年开放，冬天会关门的早一些，而且完全免费。即不需要付款，由此确定D为正确答案。\n第19题答案：A\n对应原文：At present the glass houses are open from 10am to 3pm Mondays to Thursdays, and it’s hoped to extend this to the weekend soon\n答案解析：目前玻璃房的开放时间是周一到周四早上10点到下午3点。希望很快能够在周末也开放。可见现在周末还处于关闭状态，因此确定A为正确答案。\n第20题答案：C\n对应原文：A huge amount of work has been done on them to repair the damage following the disastrous fire that recently destroyed their western side\n答案解析：一场大火摧毁了玻璃房的西侧。做了许多工作才将其修复。由此确定C为正确答案。"

Before we plan our presentation about refrigeration, let’s discuss what we’ve discovered so far\nJACK:\nFine, Annie. Though I have to admit I haven’t done much research yet.\nANNIE:\nNor me. But I found an interesting article about icehouses. I’d seen some 18th- and 19th-century ones here in the UK, so I knew they were often built in a shady area or underground, close to lakes that might freeze in the winter. Then blocks of ice could be cut and stored in the icehouse.\nBut I didn’t realise that insulating the blocks with straw or sawdust meant they didn’t melt for months (Q21)\n. The ancient Romans had refrigeration, too.\nJACK:\nI didn’t know that.\nANNIE:\nYes, pits were dug in the ground, and snow was imported from the mountains – even though they were at quite a distance. The snow was stored in the pits. Ice formed at the bottom of it.\nBoth the ice and the snow were then sold (Q22)\n. The ice cost more than the snow and my guess is that only the wealthy members of society could afford it\nJACK:\nI wouldn’t be surprised. I also came across an article about modern domestic fridges. Several different technologies are used, but they were too complex for me to understand\nANNIE:\nYou have to wonder what happens when people get rid of old ones.\nJACK:\nYou mean because the gases in them are harmful for the environment?\nANNIE:\nExactly. At least there are now plenty of organisations that will recycle most of the components safely, but of course\nsome people just dump old fridges in the countryside (Q23)\n.\nJACK:\nIt’s hard to see how they can be stopped unfortunately (Q23)\n. In the UK we get rid of three million a year altogether!.\nANNIE:\nThat sounds a lot, especially because fridges hardly ever break down.\nJACK:\nThat’s right. In this country we keep domestic fridges for 11 years on average, and a lot last for 20 or more.\nSo if you divide the cost by the number of years you can use a fridge, they’re not expensive, compared with some household appliances (Q24)\n.\nANNIE:\nTrue. I suppose manufacturers encourage people to spend more by making them different colours and designs. I’m sure when my parents bought their first fridge they had hardly any choice!\nJACK:\nYes, there’s been quite a change.\nJACK:\nRight, let’s make a list of topics to cover in our presentation, and decide who’s going to do more research on them. Then later, we can get together and plan the next step.\nANNIE:\nOK. How about starting with how useful refrigeration is, and\nthe range of goods that are refrigerated (Q25)\nnowadays?\nBecause of course it’s not just food and drinks.\nJACK:\nNo, I suppose flowers and medicines are refrigerated, too.\nANNIE:\nAnd computers.\nI could do that (Q25)\n, unless you particularly want to.\nJACK:\nNo, that’s fine by me.\nWhat about the effects of refrigeration on people’s health (Q26)?\nAfter all, some of the chemicals used in the 19th century were pretty harmful, but there have been lots of benefits too, like always having access to fresh food. Do you fancy dealing with that?\nANNIE:\nI’m not terribly keen, to be honest.\nJACK:\nNor me. My mind just goes blank when I read anything about chemicals.\nANNIE:\nOh, all right then, I’ll do you a favour (Q26)\n. But you owe me, Jack.\nOK.\nWhat about the effects on food producers (Q27)\n, like farmers in poorer countries being able to export their produce to developed countries? Something for you, maybe?\nJACK:\nI don’t mind. It should be quite interesting (Q27)\n.\nANNIE:\nI think we should also look at\nhow refrigeration has helped whole cities (Q28)\n– like Las Vegas, which couldn’t exist without refrigeration because it’s in the middle of a desert.\nJACK:\nRight. I had a quick look at an economics book in the library that’s got a chapter about this sort of thing. I could give you the title, if you want to do this section.\nANNIE:\nNot particularly, to be honest. I find economics books pretty heavy going, as a rule.\nJACK:\nOK,\nleave it to me, then (Q28)\n.\nANNIE:\nThanks.\nThen there’s transport\n, and the difference that refrigerated trucks have made.\nI wouldn’t mind having a go at that (Q29)\n.\nJACK:\nDon’t forget trains, too. I read something about milk and butter being transported in refrigerated railroad cars in the USA, right back in the 1840s.\nANNIE:\nI hadn’t thought of trains. Thanks.\nJACK:\nShall we have a separate section on\ndomestic fridges (Q30)\n? After all, they’re something everyone’s familiar with.\nANNIE:\nWhat about splitting it into two (Q30)\n? You could investigate 19th-and 20th-century fridges, and I’ll concentrate on what’s available these days, and how manufacturers differentiate their products from those of their competitors.\nJACK:\nOK,\nthat’d suit me (Q30)\n.\n剑桥雅思15 Test4 Part3雅思听力答案\n21.

My mind just goes blank when I read anything about chemicals.\nANNIE:\nOh, all right then, I’ll do you a favour. But you owe me, Jack.\n答案解析：一开始Jack和Annie表示都不想做这一部分。最后Annie让步，表示由自己来做，Jack欠自己一次。由此确定A为正确答案。\n第27题答案：B\n对应原文：JACK: I don’t mind. It should be quite interesting\n答案解析：这道题没有之前那么多的弯弯绕绕，Jack直接表示自己不介意做相关的东西，因此确定B为正确答案。\n第28题答案：B\n对应原文：\nANNIE:\nNot particularly, to be honest. I find economics books pretty heavy going, as a rule.\nJACK:\nOK, leave it to me, then\n答案解析：Annie表示自己对该部分不太感兴趣，觉得经济学的书很难懂。Jack相继表示把这部分留给他，因此确定B为正确答案。\n第29题答案：A\n对应原文：\nANNIE:\nThanks. Then there’s transport, and the difference that refrigerated trucks have made. I wouldn’t mind having a go at that\n答案解析：Annie直接表示自己不介意做这部分，由此确定A为正确答案。\n第30题答案：C\n对应原文：\nANNIE:\nWhat about splitting it into two? You could investigate 19th-and 20th-century fridges, and I’ll concentrate on what’s available these days, and how manufacturers differentiate their products from those of their competitors.\nJACK:\nOK,\nthat’d suit me\n答案解析：Annie提议家用冰箱分成两部分，每人各做一部分，Jack则表示了赞同。即两人都做，由此确定C为正确答案。"

I particularly looked at how ordinary lives were affected by changes that happened at that time. This was a time that saw the beginning of a new phenomenon: consumerism -where buying and selling goods became a major part of ordinary people’s lives.\nIn fact, it was in the 19th century that the quantity and quality of people’s possessions was used as an indication of the\nwealth (Q31)\nof the country. Before this, the vast majority of people had very few possessions, but all that was changed by the Industrial Revolution. This was the era from the mid-18th to the late 19th century, when improvements in how goods were made as well as in\ntechnology (Q32)\ntriggered massive social changes that transformed life for just about everybody in several key areas.\nFirst let’s look at manufacturing. When it comes to manufacturing, we tend to think of the Industrial Revolution in images of steam engines and coal. And it’s true that the Industrial Revolution couldn’t have taken place at all if it weren’t for these new sources of\npower (Q33)\n. They marked an important shift away from the traditional watermills and windmills that had dominated before this. The most advanced industry for much of the 19th century was\ntextiles (Q34)\n. This meant that fashionable fabrics, and lace and ribbons were made available to everyone\nBefore the Industrial Revolution, most people made goods to sell in small workshops, often in their own homes. But enormous new\nmachines (Q35)\nwere now being created that could produce the goods faster and on a larger scale, and these required a lot more space. So large factories were built, replacing the workshops, and forcing workers to travel to work. In fact. large numbers of people migrated from villages into towns as a result.\nAs well as manufacturing, there were new technologies in transport, contributing to the growth of consumerism. The horse-drawn stagecoaches and carts of the 18th century, which carried very few people and goods, and travelled slowly along poorly surfaced roads, were gradually replaced by the numerous canals that were constructed. These were particularly important for the transportation of goods. The canals gradually fell out of use, though, as railways were developed, becoming the main way of moving goods and people from one end of the country to the other. And the goods they moved weren’t just coal, iron, clothes, and so on – significantly, they included\nnewspapers (Q36)\n, which meant that thousands of people were not only more knowledgeable about what was going on in the country, but could also read about what was available in the shops. And that encouraged them to buy more. So faster forms of transport resulted in distribution becoming far more efficient -goods could now be sold all over the country, instead of just in the\nlocal (Q37)\nmarket.\nThe third main area that saw changes that contributed to consumerism was retailing, The number and quality of shops grew rapidly, and in particular, small shops suffered as customers flocked to the growing number of department stores – a form of retailing that was new in the 19th century. The entrepreneurs who opened these found new ways to stock them with goods, and to attract customers: for instance, improved\nlighting (Q38)\ninside greatly increased the visibility of the goods for sale. Another development that made goods more visible from outside resulted from the use of plate glass, which made it possible for\nwindows (Q39)\nto be much larger than previously. New ways of promoting goods were introduced, too. Previously, the focus had been on informing potential customers about the availability of goods; now there was an explosion in\nadvertising (Q40)\ntrying to persuade people to go shopping.\nFlanders claims that one of the great effects of the Industrial Revolution was that it created choice. All sorts of things that had previously been luxuries – from sugar to cutlery-became conveniences, and before long they’d turned into necessities: life without sugar or cutlery was unimaginable.Rather like mobile phones these days!\n剑桥雅思15 Test4 Part4雅思听力答案\n31. wealth\n32. technology\n33. power\n34. textile(s)\n35. machines\n36. newspapers\n37. local\n38. lighting\n39. windows\n40. advertising"

I wanted some information about the workshops in the school holidays.\nSARAH:\nSure.\nFATHER:\nI have two daughters who are interested. The younger one’s Lydia, she’s four – do you take children as young as that?\nSARAH:\nYes, our Tiny Engineers workshop is for four to five-year-olds.\nFATHER:\nWhat sorts of activities do they do?\nSARAH:\nAll sorts. For example, they work together to design a special cover that goes round an\negg (Q1)\n, so that when it’s inside they can drop it from a height and it doesn’t break. Well, sometimes it does break but that’s part of the fun!\nFATHER:\nRight. And Lydia loves building things. Is there any opportunity for her to do that?\nSARAH:\nWell, they have a competition to see who can make the highest\ntower (Q2)\n. You’d be amazed how high they can go.\nFATHER:\nRight.\nSARAH:\nBut they’re learning all the time as well as having fun. For example, one thing they do is to design and build a\ncar (Q3)\nthat’s attached to a balloon, and the force of the air in that actually powers the car and makes it move along. They go really fast too.\nFATHER:\nOK, well, all this sounds perfect.\nFATHER:\nNow Carly, that’s my older daughter, has just had her seventh birthday, so presumably she’d be in a different group?\nSARAH:\nYes, she’d be in the Junior Engineers. That’s for children from six to eight.\nFATHER:\nAnd do they do the same sorts of activities?\nSARAH:\nSome are the same, but a bit more advanced. So they work out how to build model vehicles, things like cars and trucks, but also how to construct\nanimals (Q4)\nusing the same sorts of material and technique, and then they learn how they can program them and make them move.\nFATHER:\nSo they learn a bit of coding?\nSARAH:\nThey do. They pick it up really quickly. We’re there to help if they need it, but they learn from one another too.\nFATHER:\nRight. And do they have competitions too?\nSARAH:\nYes, with the Junior Engineers, it’s to use recycled materials like card and wood to build a\nbridge (Q5)\n, and the longest one gets a prize.\nFATHER:\nThat sounds fun. I wouldn’t mind doing that myself!\nSARAH:\nThen they have something a bit different, this is which is to think up an idea for a five-minute\nmovie (Q6)\nand then film it, using special animation software. You’d be amazed what they come up with.\nFATHER:\nAnd of course, that’s something they can put on their phone and take home to show all their friends.\nSARAH:\nExactly. And then they also build a robot in the shape of a human, and they\ndecorate (Q7)\nit and program it so that it can move its arms and legs.\nFATHER:\nPerfect. So, is it the same price as the Tiny Engineers?\nSARAH:\nIt’s just a bit more: £50 for the five weeks\nFATHER:\nAnd are the classes on a Monday, too?\nSARAH:\nThey used to be, but we found it didn’t give our staff enough time to clear up after the first workshop, so we moved them to\nWednesdays (Q8)\n. The classes are held in the morning from ten to eleven.\nFATHER:\nOK. That’s better for me actually. And what about the location? Where exactly are the workshops held?\nSARAH:\nThey’re in building 10A – there’s a big sign on the door, you can’t miss it, and that’s in\nFradstone (Q9)\nIndustrial Estate.\nFATHER:\nSorry?\nSARAH:\nFradstone – that’s F-R-A-D-S-T-O-N-E\nFATHER:\nAnd that’s in Grasford, isn’t it?\nSARAH:\nYes, up past the station.\nFATHER:\nAnd will I have any\nparking (Q10)\nproblems there?\nSARAH:\nNo, there’s always plenty available. So would you like to enrol Lydia and Carly now?\nFATHER:\nOK\nSARAH:\nSo can I have your full name …\n剑桥雅思16 Test1 Part1雅思听力答案\n1. egg\n2. tower\n3. car\n4. animals\n5. bridge\n6. movie/film\n7. decorate\n8.

Thank you for choosing us for your two weeks of work experience. My name is Julia Simmons, and since the beginning of this year I’ve been the managing director.\nStevenson’s is quite an old company. Like me, the founder, Ronald Stevenson, went into the steel industry when he left school – that was in 1923.\nHe set up this company when he finished his apprenticeship, in 1926 (Q11)\n, although he actually started making plans two years earlier, in 1924. He was a very determined young man!\nStevenson’s long-term plan was to manufacture components for the machine tools industry although in fact that never came about – and for the automotive industry, that is, cars and lorries. However, there was a delay of five years before that happened, because shortly before the company went into production,\nStevenson was given the opportunity to make goods for hospitals and other players in the healthcare industry so that’s what we did for the first five years (Q12)\n.\nOver the years, we’ve expanded the premises considerably – we were lucky that the site is big enough, so\nmoving to a new location has never been necessary\n. However, the layout is far from ideal for modern machinery and production methods, so we\nintend to carry out major refurbishment of this site (Q13)\nover the next five years.\nI’d better give you some idea of what you’ll be doing during your two weeks with us, so you know what to expect.\nMost mornings you’ll have a presentation from one of the managers (Q14)\n, to learn about their department, starting this morning with research and development. And you’ll all spend some time in each department, observing what’s going on and talking to people – as long as you don’t stop them from doing their work altogether! In the past, a teacher from your school has come in at the end of each week to find out how the group were getting on, but your school isn’t able to arrange that this year.\nOK, now I’ll briefly help you to orientate yourselves around the site. As you can see, we’re in the reception area, which we try to make attractive and welcoming to visitors. There’s a corridor running left from here, and\nif you go along that. the door facing you at the end is the entrance to the coffee room. This looks out onto the main road on one side, and some trees on the other (Q15)\n, and that’ll be where you meet each morning.\nThe factory is the very big room on the far side of the site. Next to it is\nthe warehouse, which can be accessed by lorries going up the road to the turning area at the end. You can get to the warehouse by crossing to the far side of the courtyard, and then the door is on your right (Q16)\n.\nSomewhere you’ll be keen to find is the\nstaff canteen. This is right next to reception\n. I can confidently say that the food’s very good, but the view isn’t.\nThe windows on one side look onto a corridor and courtyard\n, which aren’t very attractive at all, and\non the other onto the access road (Q17)\n, which isn’t much better.\nYou’ll be using the meeting room quite often, and\nyou’ll find it by walking along the corridor to the left of the courtyard and continuing along it to the end. The meeting room is the last one on the right (Q18)\n, and I’m afraid there’s no natural daylight in the room.\nThen you’ll need to know where some of the offices are.\nThe human resources department is at the front of this building, so you head to the left along the corridor from reception, and it’s the second room you come to. It looks out onto the main road (Q19)\n.\nAnd finally, the boardroom, where you’ll be meeting sometimes. That has quite a pleasant view, as\nit looks out on to the trees. Go along the corridor past the courtyard, right to the end. The boardroom is on the left, next to the factory (Q20)\n.\nOK, now are there any questions before we…\n剑桥雅思16 Test1 Part2雅思听力答案\n11.

Next to it is the warehouse, which can be accessed by lorries going up the road to the turning area at the end. You can get to the warehouse by crossing to the far side of the courtyard, and then the door is on your right\n答案解析：原文中对仓库的位置其实进行了两种描述。其一：仓库位于工厂旁边。卡车沿着路往上走，在道路尽头的拐弯处就能到达。其二，仓库位于庭院的远端，门在右侧，无论根据哪一种都可以确定C为正确答案。\n第17题答案：G\n对应原文：This is right next to reception. The windows on one side look onto a corridor and courtyard, which aren’t very attractive at all, and on the other onto the access road\n答案解析：食堂位于recption旁边，一侧的窗户对着走廊和庭院，一次对着access raod，因此确定G为正确答案。\n第18题答案：B\n对应原文：you’ll find it by walking along the corridor to the left of the courtyard and continuing along it to the end. The meeting room is the last one on the right\n答案解析：这道题的难点在于，它没有从reception出发，而是直接指向了庭院的左侧走廊。会议室在走廊尽头的右手边，因此确定B为正确答案。\n第19题答案：I\n对应原文：The human resources department is at the front of this building, so you head to the left along the corridor from reception, and it’s the second room you come to. It looks out onto the main road\n答案解析：人力资源位于建筑物的前面。从reception出来往左走，遇到的第二间屋子就是。由此确定I为正确答案。\n第20题答案：A\n对应原文：it looks out on to the trees. Go along the corridor past the courtyard, right to the end. The boardroom is on the left, next to the factory\n答案解析：boardroom面朝树木。沿着走廊穿过庭院，一直到尽头。会议室在左手边，紧挨着工厂。因此确定A为正确答案。"

Like, they gave us the theme of birds to base our project on, and I’m not really all that interested in wildlife. But I’m starting to get into it. I’ve pretty well finished the introductory stage.\nJESS:\nSo have I.\nWhen they gave us all those handouts with details of books and websites to look at, I was really put off, but the more I read, the more interested I got (Q21)\n.\nTOM:\nMe too. I found I could research so many different aspects of birds in art – colour, movement, texture. So I was looking forward to the Bird Park visit.\nJESS:\nWhat a letdown! It poured with rain and we hardly saw a single bird.\nMuch less use than the trip to the Natural History Museum (Q22)\n.\nTOM:\nYeah. I liked all the stuff about evolution there. The workshop sessions with Dr Fletcher were good too, especially the brainstorming sessions.\nJESS:\nI missed those because I was ill. I wish we could’ve seen the projects last year’s students did.\nTOM:\nMm. I suppose they want us to do our own thing, not copy.\nJESS:\nHave you drafted your proposal yet?\nTOM:\nYes, but I haven’t handed it in. I need to amend some parts. I’ve realised the notes from my research are almost all just descriptions,\nI haven’t actually evaluated anything. So I’ll have to fix that (Q23)\n.\nJESS:\nOh, I didn’t know we had to do that. I’ll have to look at that too. Did you do a timeline for the project?\nTOM:\nYes, and a mind map.\nJESS:\nYeah, so did I. I quite enjoyed that. But it was hard having to explain the basis for my decisions in my action plan.\nTOM:\nWhat?\nJESS:\nYou know, give a rationale\nTOM:\nI didn’t realise we had to do that. OK. I can add it now. And I’ve done the video diary presentation, and worked out what I want my outcome to be in the project.\nJESS:\nSomeone told me\nit’s best not to be too precise about your actual outcome at this stage (Q24)\n, so you have more scope to explore your ideas later on. So I’m going to go back to my proposal to make it a bit more vague.\nTOM:\nReally? OK. I’ll change that too then.\nTOM:\nOne part of the project I’m unsure about is where we choose some paintings of birds and say what they mean to us. Like, I chose a painting of a falcon by Landseer. I like it because the bird’s standing there with his head turned to one side, but he seems to be staring straight at you. But I can’t just say it’s a bit scary, can I?\nJESS:\nYou could talk about the possible danger suggested by the bird’s look (Q25)\n.\nTOM:\nOh, OK.\nJESS:\nThere’s a picture of a fish hawk by Audubon I like. It’s swooping over the water with a fish in its talons, and with great black wings which take up most of the picture\nTOM:\nSo you could discuss it in relation to predators and food chains?\nJESS:\nWell actually I think\nI’ll concentrate on the impression of rapid motion it gives (Q26)\n.\nTOM:\nRight.\nJESS:\nDo you know that picture of a kingfisher by van Gogh – it’s perching on a reed growing near a stream\nTOM:\nYes it’s got these beautiful blue and red and black shades\nJESS:\nMm hm. I’ve actually chosen it because I saw a real kingfisher once\nwhen I was little. I was out walking with my grandfather (Q27)\n, and I’ve never forgotten it\nTOM:\nSo we can use a personal link?\nJESS:\nSure\nTOM:\nOK. There’s a portrait called William Wells, I can’t remember the artist but it’s a middle-aged man who’s just shot a bird. And his expression, and the way he’s holding the bird in his hand suggests he’s not sure about what he’s done.\nTo me it’s about how ambiguous people are in the way they exploit the natural world (Q28)\n.\nJESS:\nInteresting. There’s Gauguin’s picture Vairumati. He did it in Tahiti. It’s a woman with a white bird behind her that is eating a lizard, and what I’m interested in is what idea this bird refers to. Apparently,\nit’s a reference to the never-ending cycle of existence (Q29)\n.\nTOM:\nWow. I chose a portrait of a little boy. Giovanni de Medici.\nHe’s holding a tiny bird in one fist. I like the way he’s holding it carefully so he doesn’t hurt it (Q30)\n.\nJESS:\nAh right.\n剑桥雅思16 Test1 Part3雅思听力答案\n21-22. CE\n23-24. BE\n25. D\n26. C\n27. A\n28. H\n29. F\n30. G"

So I’ll have to fix that.\nJESS:\nOh, I didn’t know we had to do that. I’ll have to look at that too.\n答案解析：Tom表示自己的研究笔记都是描述，没有评价，需要修改。Jess说自己之前没有意识到还得这样做，也得看一下。因此确定E为正确答案。\n第25题答案：D\n对应原文：You could talk about the possible danger suggested by the bird’s look\n答案解析：对于Falcon，可以讨论下这种鸟类长相所体现的危险。D选项petential threat对应possible danger，由此确定为正确答案。\n第26题答案：C\n对应原文：Well actually I think I’ll concentrate on the impression of rapid motion it gives\n答案解析：Fish Hawk的相关内容则以它个人留下的快速印象为主。C选项fast movement对应rapid motion，由此确定它为正确答案。\n第27题答案：A\n对应原文：I saw a real kingfisher once when I was little. I was out walking with my grandfather\n答案解析：小时候跟爷爷散步的时候见过一只kingfisher。A选项childhood memory对应little，由此确定为正确答案。\n第28题答案：H\n对应原文：To me it’s about how ambiguous people are in the way they exploit the natural world\n答案解析：这句话听起来虽然有些难懂，但ambiguous与confused的同义替换十分明显，由此确定H为正确答案。\n第29题答案：F\n对应原文：Apparently, it’s a reference to the never-ending cycle of existence\n答案解析：F选项中continuity对应never-ending cycle，life对应existence，由此确定它为正确答案。\n第30题答案：G\n对应原文： He’s holding a tiny bird in one fist. I like the way he’s holding it carefully so he doesn’t hurt it\n答案解析：原文中指出“他如此小心的拿着小鸟，从而让自己不会伤害到它”。所有选项中与此相关的之后G自然保护，因此确定它为正确答案。"

Stoicism was founded in Ancient Greece by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC, but was practised by the likes of Epictetus, Cato, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius. Amazingly, we still have access to these ideas, despite the fact that the most famous Stoics never wrote anything down for\npublication (Q32)\n. Cato definitely didn’t. Marcus Aurelius never intended his\nMeditations\nto be anything but personal. Seneca’s letters were, well, letters and Epictetus’ thoughts come to us by way of a note-taking student.\nStoic principles were based on the idea that its followers could have an unshakable happiness in this life and the key to achieving this was virtue. The road to virtue, in turn, lay in understanding that destructive emotions, like anger and jealousy, are under our conscious control – they don’t have to control us, because we can learn to control them. In the words of Epictetus: “external events I cannot control, but the\nchoices (Q33)\nI make with regard to them. I do control”.\nThe modern day philosopher and writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb defines a Stoic as someone who has a different perspective on experiences which most of us would see as wholly\nnegative (Q34)\n; a Stoic “transforms fear into caution, pain into transformation, mistakes into initiation and desire into undertaking”. Using this definition as a model, we can see that throughout the centuries Stoicism has been practised in more recent history by kings, presidents, artists, writers and entrepreneurs.\nThe founding fathers of the United States were inspired by the philosophy. George Washington was introduced to Stoicism by his neighbours at age seventeen, and later. put on a\nplay (Q35)\nbased on the life of Cato to inspire his men. Thomas Jefferson kept a copy of Seneca beside his bed.\nWriters and artists have also been inspired by the stoics. Eugène Delacroix, the renowned French Romantic artist (known best for his painting\nLiberty Leading the People\n) was an ardent Stoic, referring to it as his “consoling religion”.\nThe economist Adam Smith’s theories on\ncapitalism (Q36)\nwere significantly influenced by the Stoicism that he studied as a schoolboy, under a teacher who had translated Marcus Aurelius works.\nToday’s political leaders are no different, with many finding their inspiration from the ancient texts. Former US president Bill Clinton rereads Marcus Aurelius every single year, and many have compared former President Obama’s calm leadership style to that of Cato. Wen Jiabao the former prime minister of China, claims that\nMeditations\nis one of two books he travels with and that he has read it more than one hundred times over the course of his life.\nStoicism had a profound influence on Albert Ellis. who invented Cognitive Behaviour Therapy which is used to help people manage their problems by changing the way that they think and behave. It’s most commonly used to treat\ndepression (Q37)\n. The idea is that we can take control of our lives by challenging the irrational beliefs that create our faulty thinking, symptoms and behaviours by using\nlogic (Q38)\ninstead\nStoicism has also become popular in the world of business. Stoic principles can build the resilience and state of mind required to overcome setbacks because Stoics teach turning obstacles into\nopportunity (Q39)\n. A lesson every business entrepreneur needs to learn.\nI would argue that studying Stoicism is as relevant today as it was 2,000 years ago, thanks to its brilliant insights into how to lead a good life. At the very root of the thinking, there is a very simple way of living -control what you can and accept what you can’t. This is not as easy as it sounds and will require considerable\npractice (Q40)\n– it can take a lifetime to master. The Stoics also believed the most important foundation for a good and happy life is not money, fame power or pleasure, but having a disciplined and principled character – something which seems to resonate with many people today.\n剑桥雅思16 Test1 Part4听力答案\n31. practical\n32. publication\n33. choices\n34. negative\n35. play\n37. capitalism\n37. depression\n38. logic\n39. opportunity\n40. practice/practise"

Can I help you?\nWOMAN:\nOh, hi. I saw your advertisement about copying pictures to disk and I’d like a bit more information about what you do.\nEMPLOYEE:\nSure. What would you like to know?\nWOMAN:\nWell, I’ve got a box full of old family photos that’s been up in the attic for years some of them must be 50 or 60 years old, and I’d like to get them converted to digital format.\nEMPLOYEE:\nSure, we can do that for you\nWOMAN:\nRight. And what about size? The photos are all sorts of sizes – are there any restrictions?\nEMPLOYEE:\nWell the maximum size of photo we can do with our normal service is 30 centimetres. And each picture must be at least 4 centimetres. that’s the minimum we can cope with.\nWOMAN:\nThat should be fine. And some of them are in a\nframe (Q1)\n– should I take them out before I send them?\nEMPLOYEE:\nYes please, we can’t copy them otherwise. And also the photos must all be separate, they mustn’t be stuck into an album.\nWOMAN:\nOK, that’s not a problem. So can you give me an idea of how much this will cost? I’ve got about 360 photos I think\nEMPLOYEE:\nWe charge £\n195 (Q2)\nfor 300 to 400 photos for the basic service.\nWOMAN:\nOK. And does that include the disk?\nEMPLOYEE:\nYes, one disk – but you can get extra ones for £5 each\nWOMAN:\nThat’s good. So do l need to pay when I send you the photos?\nEMPLOYEE:\nNo, we won’t need anything until we’ve actually copied the pictures. Then we’ll let you know how much it is. and once we’ve received the\npayment (Q3)\n, we’ll send the parcel off to you.\nWOMAN:\nRight.\nEMPLOYEE:\nIs there anything else you’d like to ask about our services?\nWOMAN:\nYes. I’ve roughly sorted out the photos into groups, according to what they’re about – so can you keep them in those groups when you copy them?\nEMPLOYEE:\nSure. We’ll save each group in a different folder on the disk and if you like, you can suggest a name for each folder\nWOMAN:\nSo I could have one called\n‘Grandparents’ (Q4)\nfor instance?\nEMPLOYEE:\nExactly.\nWOMAN:\nAnd do you do anything besides scan the photos? Like, can you make any improvements?\nEMPLOYEE:\nYes in the standard service each photo is checked, and we can sometimes touch up the\ncolour (Q5)\na bit, or improve the contrast – that can make a big difference\nWOMAN:\nOK. And some of the photos are actually quite fragile – they won’t get damaged in the process, will they?\nEMPLOYEE:\nNo, if any look particularly fragile, we’d do them by\nhand (Q6)\n. We do realise how precious these old photos can be.\nWOMAN:\nSure\nEMPLOYEE:\nAnd another thing is we can make changes to a photo if you want- so if you want to remove an object from a photo, or maybe alter the\nbackground (Q7)\n, we can do that.\nWOMAN:\nReally? I might be interested in that. I’ll have a look through the photos and see. Oh. and talking of fixing photos-I’ve got a few that aren’t properly in\nfocus (Q8)\n. Can you do anything to make that better?\nEMPLOYEE:\nNo. I’m afraid that’s one thing we can’t do.\nWOMAN:\nОК.\nEMPLOYEE:\nAny other information I can give you?\nWOMAN:\nEr… oh, how long will it all take?\nEMPLOYEE:\nWe aim to get the copying done in\nten days (Q9)\nWOMAN:\nFine, Right, well I’ll get the photos packed up in a box and post them off to you.\nEMPLOYEE:\nRight. If you’ve got a strong cardboard box, that’s best. We’ve found that\nplastic (Q10)\nones sometimes break in the post.\nWOMAN:\nOK. Right, thanks for your help.

I’d like to bring you up to date with changes in the school that will affect your children.\nAs you know, the school buildings date from various times: some from the 1970s, some from the last five years, and of course Dartfield House is over a century old. It was commissioned by a businessman, Neville Richards, and intended as his family home, but he died before it was completed.\nHis heir chose to sell it to the local council, who turned it into offices (Q11)\n. A later plan to convert it into a tourist information centre didn’t come about, through lack of money, and instead it formed the nucleus of this school when it opened 40 years ago\nThe school has grown as the local population has increased, and I can now give you some news about the lower school site, which is separated from the main site by a road. Planning permission has been granted for development of both sites. The lower school will move to new buildings that will be constructed on the main site.\nDevelopers will construct houses on the existing lower school site (Q12)\n. Work on the new school buildings should start within the next few months.\nA more imminent change concerns the catering facilities and the canteen. The canteen is always very busy throughout the lunch period – in fact it’s often full to capacity, because a lot of our pupils like the food that’s on offer there. But there’s only one serving point, so\nmost pupils have to wait a considerable time to be served (Q13)\n. This is obviously unsatisfactory, as they may have hardly finished their lunch before afternoon lessons start.\nSo we’ve had a new Food Hall built, and this will come into use next week. It’ll have several serving areas, and I’ll give you more details about those in a minute, but one thing we ask you to do, to help in the smooth running of the Food Hall, is to\ndiscuss with your children each morning which type of food they want to eat that day (Q14)\n, so they can go straight to the relevant serving point. There won’t be any junk food – everything on offer will be healthy – and there’s no change to the current system of paying for lunches by topping up your child’s electronic payment card online.\nYou may be wondering what will happen to the old canteen.\nWe’ll still have tables and chairs in there, and pupils can eat food from the Food Hall or lunch they’ve brought from home (Q15)\n. Eventually we may use part of the canteen for storage, but first we’ll see how many pupils go in there at lunchtime\nOK, back to the serving points in the Food Hall, which will all have side dishes, desserts and drinks on sale, as well as main courses.\nOne serving point we call\nWorld Adventures. This will serve a different country’s cuisine each day (Q16)\n, maybe Chinese one day and Lebanese the next. The menus will be planned for a week at a time, so pupils will know what’s going to be available the whole of that week.\nStreet Life is also international, with food from three particular cultures.\nWe’ll ask pupils to make suggestions (Q17)\n, so perhaps sometimes there’ll be food from Thailand, Ethiopia and Mexico, and then one of them will be replaced by Jamaican food for a week or two.\nThe Speedy Italian serving point will\ncater particularly for the many pupils who don’t eat meat or fish (Q18)\n: they can be sure that all the food served there is suitable for them. There’ll be plenty of variety, so they shouldn’t get bored with the food.\nOK, that’s all on the new Food Hall. Now after-school lessons. These are very popular with pupils, particularly swimming – in fact there’s a waiting list for lessons. Cycling is another favourite, and I’m delighted that dozens of pupils make use of the chance to learn to ride in off-road conditions. It means that more and more cycle to and from school every day. As you know, we have a well-equipped performance centre, and\nwe’re going to start drama classes (Q19)\nin there, too. Pupils will be able to join in just for fun or work up to taking part in a play-we hope to put on at least one a year. We already teach a number of pupils to use the sound and lighting systems in the centre. And a former pupil has given a magnificent grand piano to the school, so\na few pupils will be able to learn at the school instead of going to the local college (Q20)\n. as many of them do at the moment.\n剑桥雅思16 Test2 Part2雅思听力答案\n11.

A later plan to convert it into a tourist information centre didn’t come about\n答案解析：三个选项在原文中都有提到。商人想把它当作自己的家，但完成之前就去世了。随后它被卖给当地委员会作为自己的办公室。虽然有计划将它改造成游客信息中心，但并未实现。由此排除A和B，确定C为正确答案。\n第12题答案：B\n对应原文：The lower school will move to new buildings that will be constructed on the main site. Developers will construct houses on the existing lower school site\n答案解析：Lower school会搬到主校区新建成的建筑里，而其原址上老烤鸭雅思会建起新的房屋。A选项中的all属于无中生有，而C选项则错在了additional school buildings（是houses）。B选项new homes对应construct houses，由此确定为正确答案。\n第13题答案：A\n对应原文：But there’s only one serving point, so most pupils have to wait a considerable time to be served\n答案解析：这道题比较简单一些，B选项的changes和C选项的dissatisfaction均未提到。A选项long queuing times对应wait a considerable time，由此确定为正确答案。\n第14题答案：A\n对应原文：but one thing we ask you to do, to help in the smooth running of the Food Hall, is to discuss with your children each morning which type of food they want to eat that day, this article is from Laokaoya website, so they can go straight to the relevant serving point.\n答案解析：家长需要做的事情是提前跟自己的孩子商量好吃什么，以便他们可以直接前往相应的窗口，由此确定A为正确答案。B选项的money和C选项的healthy food在原文中也有提到，但并不是家长要做的。\n第15题答案：C\n对应原文：We’ll still have tables and chairs in there, and pupils can eat food from the Food Hall or lunch they’ve brought from home\n答案解析：老餐厅仍然会有桌子和椅子，学生可以在那里吃东西。由此确定C为答案。\n第16题答案：D\n对应原文：One serving point we call World Adventures. This will serve a different country’s cuisine each day\n答案解析：World Adventures每天提供不同国家的事物，即每天菜单都会变，由此确定D为正确答案。\n第17题答案：A\n对应原文：We’ll ask pupils to make suggestions\n答案解析：Street life会邀请学生提意见，选项中只有A能与此对应，由此确定为正确答案。\n第18题答案：B\n对应原文：The Speedy Italian serving point will cater particularly for the many pupils who don’t eat meat or fish\n答案解析：Speedy Italian专为那些不吃肉或者不吃鱼的学生服务，对应B选项only vegetarian food，由此确定它为正确答案。\n第19题答案：B\n对应原文：And a former pupil has given a magnificent grand piano to the school, so a few pupils will be able to learn at the school instead of going to the local college\n答案解析：这道题的关键在于题干中的new，A，D，E三个选项在原文中都有提到，但都是已经开设的课程。因此统统排除。piona这里有will表示未来，因此确定它为正确答案。\n第20题答案：C\n对应原文：As you know, we have a well-equipped performance centre, and we’re going to start drama classes in there\n答案解析：跟上一题类似，be going to表未来，由此确定C为正确答案。"

I’ve just read an article suggesting why we tend to forget most of our dreams soon after we wake up. I mean, most of my dreams aren’t that interesting anyway, but what it said was that if we remembered everything,\nwe might get mixed up about what actually happened and what we dreamed (Q21)\n. So it’s a sort of protection. I hadn’t heard that idea before. I’d always assumed that it was just that we didn’t have room in our memories for all that stuff.\nSUSIE:\nMe too. What do you think about the idea that our dreams may predict the future?\nLUKE:\nIt’s a belief that you get all over the world.\nSUSIE:\nYeah, lots of people have a story of it happening to them, but the explanation I’ve read is that\nfor each dream that comes true, we have thousands that don’t (Q22)\n, but we don’t notice those, we don’t even remember them. We just remember the ones where something in the real world, like a view or an action, happens to trigger a dream memory.\nLUKE:\nRight. So\nit’s just a coincidence really (Q22)\n. Something else I read about is what they call segmented sleeping. That’s a theory that hundreds of years ago, people used to get up in the middle of the night and have a chat or something to eat, then go back to bed. So I tried it myself.\nSUSIE:\nWhy?\nLUKE:\nWell it’s meant to make you more creative. I don’t know why. But l gave it up after a week. It just didn’t fit in with my lifestyle.\nSUSIE:\nBut most pre-school children have a short sleep in the day don’t they? There was an experiment some students did here last term to see at what age kids should stop having naps.\nBut they didn’t really find an answer\n. They spent a lot of time working out the most appropriate methodology, but\nthe results didn’t seem to show any obvious patterns (Q23)\n.\nLUKE:\nRight. Anyway, let’s think about our assignment. Last time I had problems with the final stage, where we had to describe and justify how successful we thought we’d been. I struggled a bit with the action plan too.\nSUSIE:\nI was OK with the planning, but\nI got marked down for the self-assessment as well\n(Q24)\n. And I had big problems with the statistical stuff, that’s where I really lost marks\nLUKE:\nRight\nSUSIE:\nSo shall we plan what we have to do for this assignment?\nLUKE:\nОК\nSUSIE:\nFirst, we have to decide on our research question. So how about ‘Is there a relationship between hours of sleep and number of dreams?\nLUKE:\nOK. Then we need to think about who we’ll do the study on. About 12 people?\nSUSIE:\nRight. And shall we use other psychology students?\nLUKE:\nLet’s use people from a different department. What about\nhistory\n(Q25)\n?\nSUSIE:\nYes\n. They might have interesting dreams! Or literature students?\nLUKE:\nI don’t really know any\nSUSIE:\nOK, forget that idea. Then we have to think about our methodology. So we could use observation, but that doesn’t seem appropriate.\nLUKE:\nNo. It needs to be self-reporting I think. And we could ask them to answer questions online.\nSUSIE:\nBut in this case,\npaper\n(Q26)\nmight be better\nas they’ll be doing it straight after they wake up … in fact while they’re still half-asleep.\nLUKE:\nRight. And we’ll have to\ncheck the ethical guidelines\nfor this sort of research.\nSUSIE:\nMm, because our experiment involves\nhumans (Q27)\n, so there are special regulations.\nLUKE:\nYes, I had a look at those for another assignment I did. There’s a whole section on risk assessment, and another section on\nmaking sure they aren’t put under any unnecessary\nstress (Q28)\n.\nSUSIE:\nLet’s hope they don’t have any bad dreams!\nLUKE:\nYeah\nSUSIE:\nThen when we’ve collected all our data we have to analyse it and calculate the correlation between our two variables, that’s time sleeping and number of dreams and then\npresent our results visually in a\ngraph (Q29)\n.\nLUKE:\nRight. And the final thing is to think about\nour research and\nevaluate\n(Q30)\n. So that seems quite straightforward\nSUSIE:\nYeah. So now let’s …\n剑桥雅思16 Test2 Part3雅思听力答案\n21. B\n22. A\n23. C\n24.

So it’s just a coincidence really\n答案解析：Susie读到的解释说，对于每个实现了的梦来说，都有上千个并未实现的。Luke赞同这一说法，并表示这仅仅是概率问题。因此确定A为正确答案。\n第23题答案：C\n对应原文：But they didn’t really find an answer\n答案解析：原文中提到，研究人员花了很长时间寻找正确的研究方法，但并没有发现什么明确的结果。A选项错在controversial，B选项错在faulty，C选项conclusions与answer同义替换，由此确定为正确答案。\n第24题答案：C\n对应原文：\nSUSIE:\nI was OK with the planning, but I got marked down for the self-assessment as well. And this article is from Laokaoya website, I had big problems with the statistical stuff, that’s where I really lost marks\n答案解析：planing这一问题是Luke的，统计数据是Susie的，只有自我评估是两者都犯错了的，解题关键在于as well与both的对应，由此确定C为正确答案。\n第25题答案：history\n对应原文：\nLUKE:\nLet’s use people from a different department. What about\nhistory\n?\nSUSIE:\nYes. They might have interesting dreams!

And we could ask them to answer questions online.\nSUSIE:\nBut in this case,\npaper\nmight be better\nLUKE:\nRight.\n答案解析：还是他人更正的考察方法，Luke表示要请他们在老烤鸭网上填写问卷，而Susie则认为纸质的会更好一些。Luke认同了这一说法。因此排除online，确定paper为正确答案。\n第27题答案：humans/people\n对应原文：\nLUKE:\nRight. And we’ll have to check the ethical guidelines for this sort of research.\nSUSIE:\nMm, because our experiment involves\nhumans\n, so there are special regulations.\n答案解析：听到ethical guidelines意识到答案即将到来，空前词working with对应involves，由此确定Humas为正确答案。\n第28题答案：stress\n对应原文：There’s a whole section on risk assessment, and another section on making sure they aren’t put under any unnecessary\nstress\n答案解析：risk提示答案即将到来，修饰词minimun与not … unnecessary对应，根据修饰关系确定答案为stress。\n第29题答案：graph\n对应原文：calculate the correlation between our two variables, that’s time sleeping and number of dreams and then present our results visually in a\ngraph\n答案解析：correlation提示答案即将到来，虽然原文中没有make的明显替换，但根据词性和句义很容易筛选出graph来。\n第30题答案：evaluate\n对应原文：And the final thing is to think about our research and\nevaluate\n答案解析：最后一题比较简单一些。从题干可以看出空上应该填动词，think about超出字数限制，只能写evaluate。"

It’s a universal response to music, found in all cultures. But what’s only been discovered recently is that dancing not only makes us feel good, it’s also extremely good for our health.\nDancing, like other forms of exercise, releases hormones, such as dopamine, which make us feel relaxed and happy. And it also reduces feelings of stress or anxiety.\nDancing is also a sociable activity, which is another reason it makes us feel good.\nOne study compared people’s enjoyment of dancing at home in front of a video with dancing in a group in a studio.\nThe people dancing in a group reported feeling happier, whereas those dancing alone did not.\nIn another experiment, university researchers at York and Sheffield took a group of students and sent each of them into a lab where music was played for five minutes. Each had to choose from three options: to sit and listen quietly to the music, to cycle on an exercise bike while they listened, or to get up and dance. All were given cognitive tasks to perform before and after. The result showed that those who chose to dance showed much more\ncreativity (Q31)\nwhen doing problem-solving tasks.\nDoctor Lovatt at the University of Hertfordshire believes dance could be a very useful way to help people suffering from mental health problems. He thinks dance should be prescribed as\ntherapy (Q32)\nto help people overcome issues such as depression.\nIt’s well established that dance is a good way of encouraging adolescent girls to take exercise but what about older people? Studies have shown that there are enormous benefits for people in their sixties and beyond. One of the great things about dance is that there are no barriers to participation. Anyone can have a go, even those whose standard of\nfitness (Q33)\nis quite low\nDance can be especially beneficial for older adults who can’t run or do more intense workouts, or for those who don’t want to. One 2015 study found that even a gentle dance workout helps to promote a healthy heart. And there’s plenty of evidence which suggests that dancing lowers the risk of falls, which could result in a broken hip, for example, by helping people to improve their\nbalance (Q34)\n.\nThere are some less obvious benefits of dance for older people too. One thing I hadn’t realised before researching this topic was that dance isn’t just a physical challenge. It also requires a lot of concentration because you need to remember different steps and routines, For older people, this kind of activity is especially important because it forces their\nbrain (Q35)\nto process things more quickly and to retain more information.\nCurrent research also shows that dance promotes a general sense of well-being in older participants, which can last up to a week after a class. Participants report feeling less tired and having greater\nmotivation (Q36)\nto be more active and do daily activities such as gardening or walking to the shops or a park.\nBallroom or country dancing, both popular with older people, have to be done in groups. They require collaboration and often involve touching a dance partner, all of which encourages interaction on the dance floor. This helps to develop new relationships and can reduce older people’s sense of\nisolation (Q37)\n, which is a huge problem in many countries\nI also looked at the benefits of Zumba. Fifteen million people in 180 countries now regularly take a Zumba class, an aerobic workout based on Latin American dance moves. John Porcari, a professor of exercise and sport science at the University of Wisconsin, analysed a group of women who were Zumba regulars and found that a class lasting 40 minutes burns about 370\ncalories (Q38)\n. This is similar to moderately intense exercises like step aerobics o kickboxing\nA study in the\nAmerican Journal of Health Behavior\nshowed that when women with\nobesity (Q39)\ndid Zumba three times a week for 16 weeks, they lost an average of 1.2 kilos and lowered their percentage of body fat by 1%. More importantly, the women enjoyed the class so much that they made it a\nhabit (Q40)\nand continued to attend classes at least once a week – very unusual for an aerobic exercise programme.\nDance is never going to compete with high-intensity workouts when it comes to physical fitness gains, but its popularity is likely to keep on rising because it’s such a fun way to keep fit.\n剑桥雅思16 Test2 Part4雅思听力答案\n31. creativity\n32. therapy\n33. fitness\n34. balance\n35. brain\n36. motivation\n37. isolation\n38. calories\n39. obesity\n40. habit"

I’m calling for some information about the cycle camp – I’m thinking of sending my son.\nJAKE:\nGreat. Well, it’s held every weekday morning over the summer vacation and we focus on basic cycling skills and safety. We have eight levels for children from three years upwards. How old’s your son?\nWOMEN:\nCharlie? He’s seven. He can ride a bike, but he needs a little more training before he’s safe to go on the road.\nJAKE:\nHe’d probably be best in Level 5. They start off practising on the site here, and we aim to get them riding on the road, but first they’re taken to ride in the\npark (Q1)\n, away from the traffic.\nWOMEN:\nRight. And can you tell me a bit about the instructors?\nJAKE:\nWell, all our staff wear different coloured shirts. So, we have three supervisors, and they have red shirts. They support the instructors, and they also stand in for me if I’m not around. Then the instructors themselves are in\nblue (Q2)\nshirts, and one of these is responsible for each class.\nWOMEN:\nOK.\nJAKE:\nIn order to be accepted, all our instructors have to submit a\nreference (Q3)\nfrom someone who’s seen them work with children – like if they’ve worked as a babysitter, for example. Then they have to complete our training course, including how to do lesson plans, and generally care for the well-being of the kids in their class. They do a great job, I have to say.\nWOMEN:\nRight. And tell me a bit about the classes. What size will Charlie’s class be?\nJAKE:\nWe have a limit of eight children in each class, so their instructor really gets to know them well. They’re out riding most of the time but they have quiet times too, where their instructor might tell them a\nstory (Q4)\nthat’s got something to do with cycling or get them to play a game together. It’s a lot of fun.\nWOMEN:\nIt must be. Now, what happens if there’s\nrain (Q5)\n? Do the classes still run?\nJAKE:\nOh yes. We don’t let that put us off – we just put on our waterproofs and keep cycling.\nWOMEN:\nAnd is there anything special Charlie should bring along with him?\nJAKE:\nWell, maybe some spare clothes, especially if the weather’s not so good. And a\nsnack (Q6)\nfor break time.\nWOMEN:\nHow about a drink?\nJAKE:\nNo, we’ll provide that. And make sure he has shoes, not sandals.\nWOMEN:\nSure. And just at present Charlie has to take\nmedication (Q7)\nevery few hours, so I’ll make sure he has that.\nJAKE:\nAbsolutely. Just give us details of when he has to take it and we’ll make sure he does.\nWOMEN:\nThanks.\nJAKE:\nNow, there are a few things you should know about Day 1 of the camp. The classes normally start at 9.30 every morning, but on Day 1 you should aim to get Charlie here by 9.20. The finishing time will be 12.30 as usual. We need the additional time because there are a few extra things to do. . The most important is that we have a very careful check to make sure that every child’s\nhelmet (Q8)\nfits properly. If it doesn’t fit, we’ll try to adjust it, or we’ll find him another one – but he must wear it all the time he’s on the bike.\nWOMEN:\nOf course.\nJAKE:\nThen after that, all the instructors will be waiting to meet their classes, and they’ll meet up in the\ntent (Q9)\n– you can’t miss it. And each instructor will take their class away and get started.\nWOMEN:\nOK. Well that all sounds good. Now can you tell me how much the camp costs a week?\nJAKE:\nOne hundred ninety-nine dollars (Q10)\n. We’ve managed to keep the price more or less the same as last year – it was one hundred ninety then. But the places are filling up quite quickly.\nWOMEN:\nRight. OK, well I’d like to book for …\n剑桥雅思16 Test3 Part1雅思听力答案\n1. park\n2. blue\n3. reference\n4. story\n5. rain\n6. snack\n7. medication\n8. helmet\n9. tent\n10. 199"

My name’s Megan Baker and I’m a recruitment consultant at AVT Recruitment specialists\nNow, our company specialises in positions that involve working in the agriculture and horticulture sectors, so that’s fresh food production, garden and park maintenance and so on. And these sectors do provide some very special career opportunities. For a start, they often offer\nopportunities for those who don’t want to be stuck with a 40-hour week, but need to juggle work with other responsibilities (Q11)\nsuch as child care – and this is very important for many of our recruits. Some people like working in a rural setting, surrounded by plants and trees instead of buildings, although we can’t guarantee that. But there are\ncertainly health benefits. especially in jobs where you’re not sitting all day looking at a screen (Q12)\n– a big plus for many people. Salaries can sometimes be good too, although there’s a lot of variety here. And you may have the opportunity in some types of jobs for travel overseas, although that obviously depends on the job, and not everyone is keen to do it.\nOf course, working outdoors does have its challenges. It’s fine in summer, but\ncan be extremely unpleasant when it’s cold and windy (Q13)\n. You may need to be pretty fit for some jobs though with modern technology that’s not as important as it once was. And standards of health and safety are much higher now than they used to be, so there are fewer work-related accidents. But\nif you like a lively city environment surrounded by lots of people, these jobs are probably not for you – they’re often in pretty remote areas (Q14)\n. And some people worry about finding a suitable place to live, but in our experience, this usually turns out fine.\nNow let me tell you about some of the exciting jobs that we have on our books right now.\nOne is for a fresh food commercial manager. Our client here is a very large fresh food producer supplying a range of top supermarkets. They operate in\na very fast-paced environment with low profit margins – the staff there work hard, but they play hard as well (Q15)\n, so if you’ve a sociable personality this may be for you.\nWe have an exciting post as an agronomist advising farmers on issues such as crop nutrition, protection against pests, and the latest legislation on farming and agricultural practices. There are\ngood opportunities for the right person to quickly make their way up the career ladder (Q16)\n, but a deep knowledge of the agricultural sector is expected of applicants.\nA leading supermarket is looking for a fresh produce buyer who is available for a\n12-month maternity cover contract (Q17)\n. You need to have experience in administration, planning and buying in the fresh produce industry, and in return will receive a very competitive salary.\nWe have also received a request for\na sales manager for a chain of garden centres. You will be visiting centres in the region (Q18)\nto ensure their high levels of customer service are maintained. This post is only suitable for someone who is prepared to live in the region.\nThere is also a vacancy for a tree technician to carry out tree cutting, forestry and conservation work. Candidates must have a clean driving licence and have training in safety procedures. A year’s experience would be preferred but\nthe company might be prepared to consider someone who has just completed an appropriate training course (Q19)\n.\nFinally, we have a position for a farm worker. This will involve a wide range of farm duties including crop sowing and harvesting, machine maintenance and animal care. Perks of the job include\nthe possibility of renting a small cottage on the estate (Q20)\n, and the chance to earn a competitive salary. A driving licence and tractor driving experience are essential.\n剑桥雅思16 Test3 Part2雅思听力答案\n11-12. AC\n13-14. BC\n15. D\n16. F\n17. A\n18. H\n19. C\n20. G"

It took me ages to decide exactly how I’d organise it, especially how could make sure that\npeople didn’t know which drink l was giving them (Q21)\n. It was hard to keep track of it all, especially as\nI had so many people doing it (Q22)\n– I had to make sure I kept a proper record of what each person had had\nROSIE:\nSo could most people tell the difference?\nADAM:\nYeah – I hadn’t thought they would be able to, but most people could.\nROSIE:\nThen there’s that experiment I did measuring the fat content of nuts, to see if the nutritional information given on the packet was accurate.\nADAM:\nThe one where you ground up the nuts and mixed them with a chemical to absorb the fat?\nROSIE:\nYes. My results were a bit problematic -the fat content for that type of nut seemed much lower than it said on the package. But I reckon the package information was right. I think\nI should probably have ground up the nuts more than I did (Q23)\n.\nIt’s possible that the scales for weighing the fat weren’t accurate enough (Q24)\n, too. I’d really like to try the experiment again some time.\nADAM:\nSo what can we say about helping people to lose weight?\nThere’s a lot we could say about what restaurants could do to reduce obesity. I read that the items at the start of a menu and the items at the end of a menu are much more likely to be chosen than the items in the middle.\nSo, if you put the low-calorie items at the beginning and end of the menu, people will probably go for the food with fewer calories (Q25)\n, without even realising what they’re doing.\nRosie:\nI think food manufacturers could do more to encourage healthy eating.\nADAM:\nHow?\nROSIE:\nWell,\nwhen manufacturers put calorie counts of a food on the label, they’re sometimes really confusing and I suspect they do it on purpose (Q26)\n. Because food that’s high in calories tastes better, and so they’ll sell more.\nADAM:\nYeah, so if you look at the amount of calories in a pizza, they’ll give you the calories per quarter pizza and you think, oh that’s not too bad. But who’s going to eat a quarter pizza?\nROSIE:\nExactly.\nADAM:\nI suppose another approach to this problem is to get people to exercise more.\nROSIE:\nRight. In England, the current guidelines are for at least 30 minutes of brisk walking, five days a week. Now when you ask them,\nabout 40% of men and 30% of women say they do this, but when you objectively measure the amount of walking they do with motion sensors, you find that only 6% of men and 4% of women do the recommended amount of exercise (Q27)\n.\nADAM:\nMm, so you can see why obesity is growing.\nROSIE:\nSo how can people be encouraged to take more exercise?\nADAM:\nWell, for example, think of the location of stairs in a train station. If people reach the stairs before they reach the escalator when they’re leaving the station, they’re more likely to take the stairs, And if you increase the width of the stairs, you’ll get more people using them at the same time.\nIt’s an unconscious process and influenced by minor modifications in their environment (Q28)\n.\nROSIE:\nRight. And it might not be a big change, but if it happens every day, it all adds up.\nADAM:\nYes. But actually,\nI’m not sure if we should be talking about exercise in our presentation (Q29)\n.\nROSIE:\nWell, we’ve done quite a bit of reading about it\nADAM:\nI know, but it’s going to mean we have a very wide focus, and our tutor did say that\nwe need to focus on causes and solutions in terms of nutrition (Q29)\n.\nROSIE:\nI suppose so. And we’ve got plenty of information about that. OK, well that will be simpler.\nADAM:\nSo what shall we do now? We’ve still got half an hour before our next lecture.\nROSIE:\nLet’s think about what we’re going to include and what will go where (Q30)\n. Then we can decide what slides we need.\nADAM:\nOK, fine.\n剑桥雅思16 Test3 Part3雅思听力答案\n21-22. CD\n23-24. CE\n25. C\n26. A\n27. B\n28. A\n29. A\n30. C"

So today we’re going to look at an important creative activity and that’s hand knitting. Ancient knitted garments have been found in many different countries, showing that knitting is a global activity with a long history.\nWhen someone says the word ‘knitting’ we might well picture an elderly person – a\ngrandmother (Q31)\nperhaps-sitting by the fire knitting garments for themselves or other members of the family. It’s a homely image, but one that may lead you to feel that knitting is an activity of the past – and, indeed, during the previous\ndecade (Q32)\n, it was one of the skills that was predicted to vanish from everyday life. For although humans have sewn and knitted their own clothing for a very long time, many of these craft-based skills went into decline when industrial machines took over – mainly because they were no longer passed down from one generation to another. However, that’s all changing and interest in knitting classes in many countries is actually rising, as more and more people are seeking formal instruction in the skill. With that trend, we’re also seeing an increase in the sales figures for knitting\nequipment (Q33)\n.\nSo why do people want to be taught to knit at a time when a machine can readily do the job for them? The answer is that knitting, as a handicraft, has numerous benefits for those doing it. Let’s consider what some of these might be. While many people knitted garments in the past because they couldn’t afford to buy clothes, it’s still true today that knitting can be helpful if you’re experiencing\neconomic (Q34)\nhardship. If you have several children who all need warm winter clothes, knitting may save you a lot of money. And the results of knitting your own clothes can be very rewarding, even though the skills you need to get going are really quite\nbasic (Q35)\nand the financial outlay is minimal.\nBut the more significant benefits in today’s world are to do with well-being. In a world where it’s estimated that we spend up to nine hours a day online, doing something with our hands that is craft-based makes us feel good. It releases us from the stress of a technological, fast-paced life.\nNow, let’s look back a bit to early knitting activities. In fact, no one really knows when knitting first began, but archaeological remains have disclosed plenty of information for us to think about.\nOne of the interesting things about knitting is that the earliest pieces of clothing that have been found suggest that most of the items produced were\nround (Q36)\nrather than flat.  Discoveries from the 3rd and 4th centuries in Egypt show that things like socks and gloves, that were needed to keep hands and feet warm, were knitted in one piece using four or five needles. That’s very different from most knitting patterns today, which only require two. What’s more, the very first needles people used were hand carved out of wood and other natural materials, like\nbone (Q37)\n, whereas today’s needles are largely made of steel or plastic and make that characteristic clicking sound when someone’s using them. Ancient people knitted using yarns made from linen, hemp, cotton and wool, and these were often very\nrough\n(Q38)\non the skin. The spinning wheel, which allowed people to make finer yarns and produce much greater quantities of them, led to the dominance of wool in the knitting industry – often favoured for its warmth.\nAnother interesting fact about knitting is that because it was practised in so many parts of the world for so many purposes, regional differences in\nstyle (Q39)\ndeveloped. This visual identity has allowed researchers to match bits of knitted clothing that have been unearthed over time to the region from which the wearer came or the job that he or she did.\nAs I’ve mentioned, knitting offered people from poor communities a way of making extra money while doing other tasks. For many centuries, it seems, men, women and children took every opportunity to knit, for example, while watching over\nsheep (Q40)\n, walking to market or riding in boats. So, let’s move on to take a…\n剑桥雅思16 Test3 Part4雅思听力答案\n31. grandmother\n32. decade\n33. equipment\n34. economic\n35. basic\n36. round\n37. bone\n38. rough\n39. style\n40. sheep"

I was hoping to speak to Jack Fitzgerald about renting a cottage.\nSHIRLEY:\nI’m his wife, Shirley, and we own the cottages together, so I’m sure I can help you.\nTOM:\nGreat. My name’s Tom. Some friends of ours rented Granary Cottage from you last year, and they thought it was great. So my wife and I are hoping to come in May for a week.\nSHIRLEY:\nWhat date did you have in mind?\nTOM:\nThe week beginning the 14th, if possible.\nSHIRLEY:\nI’ll just check… I’m sorry, Tom, it’s already booked that week. It’s free the week beginning the\n28th (Q1)\n, though, for seven nights. In fact, that’s the only time you could have it in May.\nTOM:\nOh. Well, we could manage that, I think. We’d just need to change a couple of things. How much would it cost?\nSHIRLEY:\nThat’s the beginning of high season, so it’d be £\n550 (Q2)\nfor the week.\nTOM:\nAh. That’s a bit more than we wanted to pay, I’m afraid. We’ve budgeted up to £500 for accommodation.\nSHIRLEY:\nWell, we’ve just finished converting another building into a cottage, which we’re calling\nChervil (Q3)\nCottage.\nTOM:\nSorry? What was that gain?\nSHIRLEY:\nChervil. C-H-E-R-V for Victor I-L.\nTOM:\nOh, that’s a herb, isn’t it?\nSHIRLEY:\nThat’s right. It grows fairly wild around here. You could have that for the week you want for £480.\nTOM:\nOK.So could you tell me something about it, please?\nSHIRLEY:\nOf course. The building was built as a\ngarage (Q4)\n. It’s a little smaller than Granary Cottage.\nTOM:\nSo that must sleep two people, as well?\nSHIRLEY:\nThat’s right. There’s a double bedroom.\nTOM:\nDoes it have a\ngarden (Q5)\n?\nSHIRLEY:\nYes, you get to it from the living room through French doors, and we provide two deckchairs. We hope to build a patio in the near future, but I wouldn’t like to guarantee it’ll be finished by May.\nTOM:\nOK.\nSHIRLEY:\nThe front door opens onto the old farmyard, and\nparking (Q6)\nisn’t a problem – there’s plenty of room at the front for that. There are some trees and potted plants there.\nTOM:\nWhat about facilities in the cottage? It has standard things like a cooker and fridge, I presume.\nSHIRLEY:\nIn the kitchen area there’s a fridge-freezer and we’ve just put in an electric cooker.\nTOM:\nIs there a washing machine?\nSHIRLEY:\nYes. There’s also a TV in the living room, which plays DVDs too. The bathroom is too small for a bath, so there’s a shower instead. I think a lot of people prefer that nowadays, anyway.\nTOM:\nIt’s more environmentally friendly, isn’t it? Unless you spend half the day in it!\nSHIRLEY:\nExactly.\nTOM:\nWhat about heating? It sometimes gets quite cool at that time of year.\nSHIRLEY:\nThere’s central heating, and if you want to light a fire, there’s a stove. We can provide all the\nwood (Q7)\nyou need for it. It smells so much nicer than coal, and it makes the room very cosy – we’ve got one in our own house.\nTOM:\nThat sounds very pleasant. Perhaps we should come in the winter, to make the most of it!\nSHIRLEY:\nYes, we find we don’t want to go out when we’ve got the fire burning. There are some attractive views from the cottage, which I haven’t mentioned. There’s a famous stone\nbridge (Q8)\n– it’s one of the oldest in the region, and you can see it from the living room. It isn’t far away. The bedroom window looks in the opposite direction, and has a lovely view of the hills and the\nmonument (Q9)\nat the top.\nTOM:\nWell, that all sounds perfect. I’d like to book it, please. Would you want a deposit?\nSHIRLEY:\nYes, we ask for thirty percent to secure your booking, so that’ll be, um, £144.\nTOM:\nAnd when would you like the rest of the money?\nSHIRLEY:\nYou’re coming in May, so the last day of\nMarch (Q10)\n, please.\nTOM:\nFine.\nSHIRLEY:\nExcellent. Could I just take your details …\n剑桥雅思16 Test4 Part1雅思听力答案\n1. 28th\n2. 550\n3. Chervil\n4. garage\n5. garden\n6. parking\n7. wood\n8. bridge\n9. monument\n10. March"

It’s free the week beginning the\n28th\n, though, for seven nights. In fact, that’s the only time you could have it in May.\n答案解析：男性先问这周14号开始可不可以，但女性查询之后表示它已经被定出去了。28号开始那一周还是空着的，由此确定答案为28。考察日期时，日子后面带不带th均可。\n第2题答案：550\n对应原文：That’s the beginning of high season, so it’d be £\n550\nfor the week.\n答案解析：没有设置任何干扰项，直接了当的说出了答案。注意50和15的区分即可。\n第3题答案：Chervil\n对应原文：we’ve just finished converting another building into a cottage, which we’re calling\nChervil\nCottage.\n答案解析：考察字母拼写，基本属于送分题。\n第4题答案：garage\n对应原文：Of course. The building was built as a\ngarage\n. It’s a little smaller than Granary Cottage.\n答案解析：题干问的是，这座建筑一开始被用于什么，录音中只有garage填上去符合句义。大家需要注意一下garage英式发音和美式发音的不同。\n第5题答案：garden\n对应原文：\nTOM:\nDoes it have a\ngarden\n?\nSHIRLEY:\nYes, you get to it from the living room through French doors,\n答案解析：男性先提出有没有花园，然后女性再给出题干中的提示词，稍微有些考验大家的短期记忆能力。\n第6题答案：parking\n对应原文：The front door opens onto the old farmyard, and\nparking\nisn’t a problem – there’s plenty of room at the front for that.\n答案解析：跟上一道题目的考察手法有些类似，都是先说答案，再说老烤鸭雅思提示词。不过parking还是比较好是别的。\n第7题答案：wood\n对应原文：if you want to light a fire, there’s a stove. We can provide all the\nwood\nyou need for it.\n答案解析：听到stove意识到答案即将到来，哪怕大家不知道这个词的含义，也可以根据burns判断空上应该填某种燃料，由此确定wood为正确答案。\n第8题答案：bridge\n对应原文：There are some attractive views from the cottage, which I haven’t mentioned. There’s a famous stone\nbridge\n– it’s one of the oldest in the region\n答案解析：几乎属于送分题，听到views意识到答案即将到来。录音中oldest对应old，由此锁定Bridge。\n第9题答案：monument\n对应原文：The bedroom window looks in the opposite direction, and has a lovely view of the hills and the\nmonument\nat the top.\n答案解析：这道题的难点主要在于单词拼写，monument是纪念碑的意思。\n第10题答案：March\n对应原文：You’re coming in May, so the last day of\nMarch\n, please.\n答案解析：空前词end对应last day，根据所有格关系确定March为正确答案。"

Next on the agenda we have traffic and highways. Councillor Thornton\nCOUNCILLOR THORNTON:\nThank you. Well, we now have the results of the survey carried out last month about traffic and road transport in the town. People were generally satisfied with the state of the roads. There were one or two complaints about potholes which will be addressed,\nbut a significant number of people complained about the increasing number of heavy vehicles (Q11)\nusing our local roads to avoid traffic elsewhere. We’d expected more complaints by commuters about the reduction in the train service, but it doesn’t seem to have affected people too much. The cycle path that runs alongside the river is very well used by both cyclists and pedestrians since the surface was improved last year but overtaking can be a problem so\nwe’re going to add a bit on the side to make it wider (Q12)\n. At some stage, we’d like to extend the path so that it goes all the way through the town, but that won’t be happening in the immediate future\nThe plans to have a pedestrian crossing next to the Post Office have unfortunately had to be put on hold for the time being. We’d budgeted for this to be done this financial year, but then there were rumours that the Post Office was going to move, which would have meant there wasn’t really a need for a crossing. Now they’ve confirmed that they’re staying where they are, but the Highways Department have told us that\nit would be dangerous to have a pedestrian crossing where we’d originally planned it as there’s a bend in the road there (Q13)\n.\nSo that’ll need some more thought.\nOn Station Road near the station and level crossing, drivers can face\nquite long waits if the level crossing’s closed, and we’ve now got signs up requesting them not to leave their engines running at that time (Q14)\n. This means pedestrians waiting on the pavement to cross\nthe railway line don’t have to breathe in car fumes. We’ve had some problems with cyclists leaving their bikes chained to the railings outside the ticket office, but the station has agreed to provide bike racks there.\nCHAIRPERSON:\nSo next on the agenda is ‘Proposals for improvements to the recreation ground’. Councillor Thornton again.\nCOUNCILLOR THORNTON:\nWell, since we managed to extend the recreation ground, we’ve spent some time talking to local people about how it could be made a more attractive and useful space. If you have a look at the map up on the screen, you can see the river up in the north. and the Community Hall near the entrance from the road. At present, cars can park between the Community Hall and that line of trees to the east, but this is quite dangerous for pedestrians so we’re suggesting\na new car park on the opposite side of the Community Hall, right next to it (Q15)\n. We also have a new location for the cricket pitch. As we’ve now purchased additional space\nto the east of the recreation ground, beyond the trees (Q16)\n, we plan to move it away from its current location. which is rather near the road, into this new area beyond the line of trees. This means there’s less danger of stray balls hitting cars or pedestrians\nWe’ve got plans for a children’s playground which will be\naccessible by a footpath from the Community Hall and will be alongside the river (Q17)\n. We’d originally thought of having it close to the road. but we think this will be a more attractive location.\nThe skateboard ramp is very popular with both younger and older children-we had considered moving this up towards the river, but in the end we decided to have it\nin the southeast corner near the road (Q18)\n. The pavilion is very well used at present by both football players and cricketers. It will stay where it is now –\nto the left of the line of trees and near to the river (Q19)\n– handy for both the football and cricket pitches And finally, we’ll be getting a new notice board for local information, and that will be\ndirectly on people’s right as they go from the road into the recreation ground (Q20)\n.\n剑桥雅思16 Test4 Part2雅思听力答案\n11.

At some stage, we’d like to extend the path so that it goes all the way through the town, but that won’t be happening in the immediate future\n答案解析：道路表面维修是去年的事情，延长自行车道到城镇只是期望，短时间内不会发生。只有扩宽是最近会做的。由此排除选项B和C，确定A为正确答案。\n第13题答案：B\n对应原文：but the Highways Department have told us that it would be dangerous to have a pedestrian crossing where we’d originally planned it as there’s a bend in the road there\n答案解析：预算已经有了。邮局本来说要搬走，但后来证实不搬了。最终导致人行通道延迟的原因为高速部门认为会有危险。由此排除选项A和C，确定B为正确答案。\n第14题答案：B\n对应原文：we’ve now got signs up requesting them not to leave their engines running at that time\n答案解析：标识主要是要求司机在等待过程中要熄火的。虽然录音中确实也提到了老烤鸭雅思行人和骑行者，但这都不是树立标识的意图，不符合题干要求。因此排除选项A和C，确定B为正确答案。\n第15题答案：C\n对应原文： a new car park on the opposite side of the Community Hall, right next to it\n答案解析：新的停车场在community hall的对面，紧挨着它。C和G相比，离Community Hall更近，由此确定C为正确答案。\n第16题答案：F\n对应原文：We also have a new location for the cricket pitch. As this is from Laokaoya website, we’ve now purchased additional space to the east of the recreation ground, beyond the trees\n答案解析：新的板球场位于娱乐区的东边，比树更远一些，由此确定F为正确答案。\n第17题答案：A\n对应原文：We’ve got plans for a children’s playground which will be accessible by a footpath from the Community Hall and will be alongside the river\n答案解析：儿童游乐区可以通过小路从Community Hall到达，并且还挨着河，由此确定A为正确答案。\n第18题答案：I\n对应原文：we had considered moving this up towards the river, but in the end we decided to have it in the southeast corner near the road\n答案解析：设置了一个小小的干扰项。本来打算将其搬到河附近，但最终确定放在道路附近的东南角。符合条件的地点只有I。\n第19题答案：E\n对应原文： It will stay where it is now – to the left of the line of trees and near to the river\n答案解析：看台保持原来位置不动，仍然位于树左边，靠近河的位置，因此确定E为正确答案。\n第20题答案：H\n对应原文：we’ll be getting a new notice board for local information, and that will be directly on people’s right as they go from the road into the recreation ground\n答案解析：新的公告栏会放在人们从道路进来之后的右手边，由此确定H为正确答案。"

I think we should start by talking about the benefits. I mean it’s great that so many cities have introduced these schemes where anyone can pick up a bike from dozens of different locations and hire it for a few hours. It makes riding a bike very convenient for people\nJAKE:\nYes, but the costs can add up and that puts people on low incomes off in some places.\nAMY:\nI suppose so, but if it means more people in general are cycling rather than driving, then because they’re increasing the amount of physical activity they do, it’s good for their health.\nJAKE:\nOK. But isn’t that of less importance? I mean,\ndoesn’t the impact of reduced emissions on air pollution have a more significant effect (Q21)\non people’s health?\nAMY:\nCertainly, in some cities bike-sharing has made a big contribution to that. And\nalso helped to cut the number of cars on the road significantly (Q22)\n.\nJAKE:\nWhich is the main point.\nAMY:\nExactly. But I’d say it’s had less of an impact on noise pollution because there are still loads of buses and lorries around.\nJAKE:\nRight.\nAMY:\nShall we quickly discuss the recommendations we’re going to make?\nJAKE:\nIn order to ensure bike-sharing schemes are successful?\nAMY:\nYes.\nJAKE:\nOK. Well, while I think it’s nice to have really state-of-the-art bikes with things like GPS, I wouldn’t say they’re absolutely necessary.\nAMY:\nBut some technical things are really important – like a fully functional app – so people can make payments and book bikes easily (Q23)\n. Places which haven’t invested in that have really struggled.\nJAKE:\nGood point … Some people say there shouldn’t be competing companies offering separate bike-sharing schemes, but in some really big cities, competition’s beneficial and anyway one company might not be able to manage the whole thing\nAMY:\nRight. Deciding how much to invest is a big question. Cities which have opened loads of new bike lanes at the same time as introducing bike-sharing schemes have generally been more successful – but there are examples of successful schemes where this hasn’t happened …\nWhat does matter though – is having a big publicity campaign (Q24)\n.\nJAKE:\nDefinitely. If people don’t know how to use the scheme or don’t understand its benefits, they won’t use it. People need a lot of persuasion to stop using their cars.\nAMY:\nShall we look at some examples now? And say what we think is good or bad about them.\nJAKE:\nI suppose we should start with Amsterdam as this was one of the first cities to have a bike-sharing scheme.\nAMY:\nYes. There was already a strong culture of cycling here, In a way\nit’s strange that there was such a demand for bike-sharing because you’d have thought most people would have used their own bikes.\nJAKE:\nAnd\nyet it’s one of the best-used schemes (Q25)\n… Dublin’s an interesting example of a success story.\nAMY:\nIt must be because the public transport system’s quite limited\nJAKE:\nNot really\n– there’s no underground. but there are trams and a good bus network.\nI’d say price has a lot to do with it (Q26)\n. It’s one of the cheapest schemes in Europe to join.\nAMY:\nBut the buses are really slow – anyway the weather certainly can’t be a factor\nJAKE:\nNo – definitely not. The London scheme’s been quite successful.\nAMY:\nYes – it’s been a really good thing for the city. The bikes are popular and the whole system is well maintained but it isn’t expanding quickly enough.\nJAKE:\nBasically,\nnot enough’s been spent on increasing the number of cycle lanes (Q27)\n. Hopefully that’ll change.\nAMY:\nYes. Now what about outside Europe?\nJAKE:\nWell bike-sharing schemes have taken off in places like Buenos Aires\nAMY:\nMmm. They built a huge network of cycle lanes to support the introduction of the scheme there, didn’t they? It attracted huge numbers of cyclists where previously there were hardly any.\nJAKE:\nAn example of good planning (Q28)\n.\nAMY:\nAbsolutely. New York is a good example of how not to introduce a scheme. When they launched it,\nit was more than ten times the price of most other schemes (Q29)\n.\nJAKE:\nMore than it costs to take a taxi. Crazy, I think the organisers lacked vision and ambition there.\nAMY:\nI think so too. Sydney would be a good example to use.\nI would have expected it to have grown pretty quickly here.\nJAKE:\nYes.\nI can’t quite work out why it hasn’t been an instant success like some of the others (Q30)\n. It’s a shame really.\nAMY:\nI know. OK so now we’ve thought about…\n剑桥雅思16 Test4 Part3雅思听力答案\n21-22. BC\n23-24. BC\n25. C\n26. F\n27. D\n28. E\n29. B\n30. A"

In fact there’s even a saying in English, ‘as dead as the dodo’, used to refer to something which no longer exists. But for many centuries the dodo was alive and well, although it could only be found in one place, the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It was a very large bird, about one metre tall, and over the centuries it had lost the ability to fly. but it survived happily under the trees that covered the island.\nThen in the year 1507 the first Portuguese ships stopped at the island. The sailors were carrying\nspices (Q31)\nback to Europe, and found the island a convenient stopping place where they could stock up with food and water for the rest of the voyage, but they didn’t settle on Mauritius. However, in 1638 the Dutch arrived and set up a\ncolony (Q32)\nthere. These first human inhabitants of the island found the dodo birds a convenient source of meat, although not everyone liked the taste.\nIt’s hard to get an accurate description of what the dodo actually looked like. We do have some written records from sailors, and a few pictures, but we don’t know how reliable these are. The best-known picture is a Dutch painting in which the bird appears to be extremely\nfat (Q33)\n, but this may not be accurate – an Indian painting done at the same time shows a much thinner bird.\nAlthough attempts were made to preserve the bodies of some of the birds, no complete specimen survives. In the early 17th century four dried parts of a bird were known to exist – of these, three have disappeared, so only one example of soft tissue from the dodo survives, a dodo\nhead (Q34)\n. Bones have also been found, but there’s only one complete skeleton in existence.\nThis single dodo skeleton has recently been the subject of scientific research which suggests that many of the earlier beliefs about dodos may have been incorrect. For example, early accounts of the birds mention how slow and clumsy it was, but scientists now believe the bird’s strong knee joints would have made it capable of\nmovement (Q35)\nwhich was not slow, but actually quite fast. In fact,  one 17th century sailor wrote that he found the birds hard to catch. It’s true that the dodo’s small wings wouldn’t have allowed it to leave the ground, but the scientists suggest that these were probably employed for\nbalance (Q36)\nwhile going over uneven ground. Another group of scientists carried out analysis of the dodo’s skull. They found that the reports of the lack of intelligence of the dodo were not borne out by their research, which suggested the bird’s\nbrain (Q37)\nwas not small, but average in size. In fact, in relation to its body size, it was similar to that of the pigeon, which is known to be a highly intelligent bird. The researchers also found that the structure of the bird’s skull suggested that one sense which was particularly well-developed was that of\nsmell (Q38)\n. So the dodo may also have been particularly good at locating ripe fruit and other food in the island’s thick vegetation.\nSo it looks as if the dodo was better able to survive and defend itself than was originally believed. Yet less than 200 years after Europeans first arrived on the island, they had become extinct. So what was the reason for this? For a long time, it was believed that the dodos were hunted to extinction, but scientists now believe the situation was more complicated than this. Another factor may have been the new species brought to the island by the sailors. These included dogs, which would have been a threat to the dodos, and also monkeys, which ate the fruit that was the main part of the dodos’ diet. These were brought to the island deliberately, but the ships also brought another type of creature –\nrats (Q39)\n, which came to land from the ships and rapidly overran the island. These upset the ecology of the island, not just the dodos but other species too. However, they were a particular danger to the dodos because they consumed their eggs, and since each dodo only laid one at a time, this probably had a devastating effect on populations.\nHowever, we now think that probably the main cause of the birds’ extinction was not the introduction of non-native species, but the introduction of agriculture. This meant that the\nforest (Q40)\nthat had once covered all the island, and that had provided a perfect home for the dodo, was cut down so that crops such as sugar could be grown. So although the dodo had survived for thousands of years, suddenly it was gone.\n剑桥雅思16 Test4 Part4雅思听力答案\n31. spice(s)\n32. colony/settlement\n33. fat\n34. head\n35. movement\n36. balance/balancing\n37. brain\n38. smell\n39. rats\n40. forest"

My name’s Jan. Are you the right person to talk to about the Buckworth Conservation Group?\nPETER\n: Yes, I’m Peter. I’m the secretary.\nJAN\n: Good. I’ve just moved to this area, and I’m interested in getting involved. I was in a similar group where I used to live. Could you tell me something about your activities, please?\nPETER\n: Of course. Well, we have a mixture of regular activities and special events. One of the regular ones is trying to keep the beach free of\nlitter (Q1)\n. A few of us spend a couple of hours a month on it, and it’s awful how much there is to clear. I wish people would be more responsible and take it home with them.\nJAN\n: I totally agree. I’d be happy to help with that. Is it OK to take\ndogs (Q2)\n?\nPETER\n: I’m afraid not, as they’re banned from the beach itself. You can take them along the cliffs, though. And children are welcome.\nJAN\n: Right.\nPETER\n: We also manage a nature reserve, and there’s a lot to do there all year round. For example, because it’s a popular place to visit, we spend a lot of time looking after the paths and making sure they’re in good condition for walking.\nJAN\n: I could certainly help with that.\nPETER\n: Good. And we have a programme of creating new habitats there. We’ve just finished making and installing nesting boxes for birds to use, and next we’re going to work on encouraging\ninsects (Q3)\n– they’re important for the biodiversity of the reserve.\nJAN\n: They certainly are.\nPETER\n: Oh, and we’re also running a project to identify the different species of\nbutterflies (Q4)\nthat visit the reserve. You might be interested in taking part in that.\nJAN\n: Sure. I was involved in something similar where I used to live, counting all the species of moths. I’d enjoy that.\nPETER\n: Another job we’re doing at the reserve is replacing the\nwall (Q5)\non the southern side, between the parking area and our woodshed. It was badly damaged in a storm last month.\nJAN\n: OK\nPETER\n: Then as I said, we have a programme of events as well, both at the weekend, and during the week.\nJAN\n: Right. I presume you have guided walks? I’d like to get to know the local countryside, as I’m new to the area.\nPETER\n: Yes, we do. The next walk is to Ruston Island, a week on Saturday. We’ll be meeting in the car park at Dunsmore Beach at low tide – that’s when the sands are dry enough for us to walk to the\nisland (Q6)\nwithout getting wet.\nJAN\n: Sounds good\nPETER\n: The island’s a great place to explore. It’s quite small, and it’s got a range of habitats. It’s also an ideal location for seeing seals just off the coast, or even on the beach.\nJAN\n: OK. And is there anything we should bring, like a picnic, for instance?\nPETER\n: Yes, do bring one, as it’s a full-day walk. And of course it’ll be wet walking across and back, so make sure your\nboots (Q7)\nare waterproof.\nJAN\n: I must buy a new pair – there’s a hole in one of my current ones! Well, I’d definitely like to come on the walk.\nPETER\n: Great. Then later this month we’re having a one-day woodwork session in Hopton Wood.\nJAN\n: I’ve never tried that before. Is it OK for\nbeginners (Q8)\nto take part?\nPETER\n: Definitely. There’ll be a couple of experts leading the session, and we keep the number of participants down, so you’ll get as much help as you need.\nJAN\n: Excellent! I’d love to be able to make chairs.\nPETER\n: That’s probably too ambitious for one day! You’ll be starting with wooden\nspoons (Q9)\n, and of course learning how to use the tools. And anything you make is yours to take home with you.\nJAN\n: That sounds like fun. When is it?\nPETER\n: It’s on the 17th, from 10 a.m. until 3. There’s a charge of\n£35 (Q10)\n, including lunch, or £40 if you want to camp in the wood.\nJAN\n: I should think I’ll come home the same day.

My name’s Lou Miller and I’m going to be your tour guide today as we take this fantastic boat trip around the Tasmanian coast. Before we set off, I just want to tell you a few things about our journey.\nOur boats aren’t huge as you can see. We already have three staff members on board and on top of that, we can transport a further fifteen people – that’s you – around the coastline. But please note\nif there are more than nine people on either side of the boat, we’ll move some of you over (Q11)\n, otherwise all eighteen of us will end up in the sea!\nWe’ve recently upgraded all our boats. They used to be jet black, but our new ones now have these comfortable dark red seats and a\nlight-green exterior (Q12)\nin order to stand out from others and help promote our company. This gives our boats a rather unique appearance, don’t you think?\nWe offer you a free lunchbox during the trip and we have three types. Lunchbox 1 contains ham and tomato sandwiches.\nLunchbox 2 contains a cheddar cheese roll (Q13)\nand Lunchbox 3 is salad-based and also contains eggs and tuna. All three lunchboxes also have a packet of crisps and chocolate bar inside. Please let staff know which lunchbox you prefer.\nI’m sure I don’t have to ask you not to throw anything into the sea. We don’t have any bins to put litter in, but\nJess, myself or Ray, our other guide, will collect it from you (Q14)\nafter lunch and put it all in a large plastic sack.\nThe engine on the boat makes quite a lot of noise so before we head off, let me tell you a few things about what you’re going to see.\nThis area is famous for its ancient lighthouse, which you’ll see from the boat as we turn past the first little island. It was built in 1838\nto protect sailors as a number of shipwrecks had led to significant loss of life (Q15)\n. The construction itself was complicated as some of the original drawings kept by the local council show. . It sits right on top of the cliffs in a very isolated spot. In the nineteenth century there were many jobs there, such as polishing the brass lamps, chopping firewood and cleaning windows, that kept lighthouse keepers busy.\nThese workers were mainly prison convicts until the middle of that century when ordinary families willing to live in such circumstances took over (Q16)\n.\nSome of you have asked me what creatures we can expect to see. I know everyone loves the penguins, but they’re very shy and, unfortunately, tend to hide from passing boats, but you might see birds in the distance, such as sea eagles, flying around the cliff edges where they nest. When we get to the rocky area inhabited by\nfur seals, we’ll stop and watch them swimming around the coast. They’re inquisitive creatures so don’t be surprised if one pops up right in front of you (Q17)\n. Their predators, orca whales, hunt along the coastline too, but spotting one of these is rare.\nDolphins, on the other hand, can sometimes approach on their own or in groups as they ride the waves beside us (Q18)\n.\nLastly, I want to mention the caves. Tasmania is famous for its caves and the ones we’ll pass by are so amazing that people are lost for words when they see them.\nThey can only\nbe approached by sea (Q19)\n, but if you feel that you want to see more than we’re able to show you, then you can take a kayak into the area on another day and one of our staff will give you more information on that. What we’ll do is to go through a narrow channel, past some incredible rock formations and from there\nwe’ll be able to see the openings to the caves, and at that point we’ll talk to you about what lies beyond (Q20)\n.\n剑桥雅思17 Test1 Part2雅思听力答案\n11.

My farm was great, but\narranging the work experience was hard (Q21)\n. One problem was it was miles away and I don’t drive. And also, I’d really wanted a placement for a month, but I could only get one for two weeks.\nDIANA:\nI was lucky, the farmer let me stay on the farm so I didn’t have to travel. But\nfinding the right sort of farm to apply to wasn’t easy (Q21)\n.\nTIM:\nNo, they don’t seem to have websites, do they. I found mine through a friend of my mother’s, but it wasn’t easy.\nDIANA:\nNo.\nTIM:\nMy farm was mostly livestock, especially sheep. I really enjoyed helping out with them.\nI was up most of one night helping a sheep deliver a lamb … (Q22)\nDIANA:\nOn your own?\nTIM:\nNo, the farmer was there, and he told me what to do. It wasn’t a straightforward birth, but I managed. It was a great feeling to see the lamb stagger to its feet and start feeding almost straight away, and to know that it was OK.\nDIANA:\nMm.\nTIM:\nThen another time a lamb had broken its leg, and they got the vet in to set it, and he talked me through what he was doing. That was really useful.\nDIANA:\nYes, my farm had sheep too. The farm was in a valley and they had a lowland breed called Suffolks, although the farmer said they’d had other breeds in the past.\nTIM:\nSo were they bred for their meat? (Q23)\nDIANA:\nMostly, yes (Q23)\n. They’re quite big and solid.\nTIM:\nMy farm was up in the hills and they had a different breed of sheep, they were Cheviots.\nDIANA:\nOh, I heard their wool’s really sought after.\nTIM:\nYes. It’s very hardwearing and they use it for carpets.\nDIANA:\nRight.\nTIM:\nI was interested in the amount of supplements they add to animals’ feed nowadays. Like, even the chickens got extra vitamins and electrolytes in their feed.\nDIANA:\nYes, I found that too. And they’re not cheap. But my farmer said some are overpriced for what they are. And\nhe didn’t give them as a matter of routine, just at times when the chickens seemed to particularly require them (Q24)\n.\nTIM:\nYes, mine said the same. He said certain breeds of chickens might need more supplements than the others, but the cheap and expensive ones are all basically the same.\nDIANA:\nMm.\nTIM:\nSo did your farm have any other livestock, Diana?\nDIANA:\nYes, dairy cows. I made a really embarrassing mistake when I was working in the milk shed. Some cows had been treated with antibiotics, so their milk wasn’t suitable for human consumption, and  it had to be put in a separate container. But\nI got mixed up, and I poured some milk from the wrong cow in with the milk for humans, so the whole lot had to be thrown away (Q25)\n. The farmer wasn’t too happy with me.\nTIM:\nI asked my farmer how much he depended on the vet to deal with health problems. I’d read reports that the livestock’s health is being affected as farmers are under pressure to increase production. Well, he didn’t agree with that, but he said that actually\nsome of the stuff the vets do, like minor operations, he’d be\nquite capable of doing himself (Q26)\n.\nDIANA:\nYeah. My farmer said the same (Q26).\nBut he reckons vets’ skills are still needed.\nDIANA:\nNow we’ve got to give a bit of feedback about last term’s modules – just short comments, apparently. Shall we do that now?\nTIM:\nOK. So medical terminology.\nDIANA:\nWell, my heart sank when I saw that, especially right at the beginning of the course. And I did struggle with it.\nTIM:\nI’d thought it’d be hard, but actually I found it all quite straightforward (Q27)\n. What did you think about diet and nutrition?\nDIANA:\nOK, I suppose.\nTIM:\nDo you remember what they told us about pet food and the fact that\nthere’s such limited checking into whether or not it’s contaminated? I mean in comparison with the checks on food for humans – I thought that was terrible (Q28)\n.\nDIANA:\nMm. I think the module that really impressed me was the animal disease one, when we looked at domesticated animals in different parts of the world, like camels and water buffalo and alpaca.\nThe economies of so many countries depend on these, but scientists don’t know much about the diseases that affect them (Q29)\n.\nTIM:\nYes,\nI thought they’d know a lot about ways of controlling and eradicating those diseases, but that’s not the case at all (Q29)\n. I loved the wildlife medication unit. Things like helping birds that have been caught in oil spills. That’s something I hadn’t thought about before.\nDIANA:\nYeah,\nI thought I might write my dissertation on something connected with that (Q30)\n.\nTIM:\nRight. So …\n剑桥雅思17 Test1 Part3雅思听力答案\n21.

I mean in comparison with the checks on food for humans – I thought that was terrible\n答案解析：Tim没想到对动物食物是否受到污染的检测十分有限，尤其是跟人类食物对比。虽然E跟原文并不是十分对应，但所有选项中只有它最为接近，因此只能选它作为答案。\n第29题答案：F\n对应原文：Diana: The economies of so many countries depend on these, but scientists don’t know much about the diseases that affect them\nTIM: Yes, I thought they’d know a lot about ways of controlling and eradicating those diseases, but that’s not the case at all\n答案解析：Diana和Tim都没想到，这么多国家的经济依赖于畜牧业，但科学家却对动物的疾病知之甚少。由此确定F为正确答案。\n第30题答案：C\n对应原文：I thought I might write my dissertation on something connected with that\n答案解析：Diana表示，她后面可能针对该方面写自己的学位论文。C选项further study对应dissertation，由此确定其为正确答案。"

Labyrinths and labyrinthine symbols have been found in regions as diverse as modern-day Turkey, Ireland, Greece, and India. There are various designs of labyrinth but what they all have in common is a winding spiral path which leads to a central area. There is one starting point at the entrance and the goal is to reach the central area. Finding your way through a labyrinth involves many twists and turns, but it’s not possible to get lost as there is only one single path.\nIn modern times, the word labyrinth has taken on a different meaning and is often used as a synonym for a maze. A maze is quite different as it is a kind of\npuzzle (Q31)\nwith an intricate network of paths. Mazes became fashionable in the 15th and 16th centuries in Europe, and can still be found in the gardens of great houses and palaces. The paths are usually surrounded by thick, high hedges so that it’s not possible to see over them. Entering a maze usually involves getting lost a few times before using\nlogic (Q32)\nto work out the pattern and find your way to the centre and then out again. There are lots of dead ends and paths which lead you back to where you started. The word ‘maze’ is believed to come from a Scandinavian word for a state of\nconfusion (Q33)\n. This is where the word ‘amazing’ comes from.\nLabyrinths, on the other hand, have a very different function. Although people now often refer to things they find complicated as labyrinths, this is not how they were seen in the past. The winding spiral of the labyrinth has been used for centuries as a metaphor for life’s journey. It served as a spiritual reminder that there is purpose and meaning to our lives and helped to give people a sense of direction. Labyrinths are thought to encourage a feeling of calm and have been used as a\nmeditation (Q34)\nand prayer tool in many cultures over many centuries.\nThe earliest examples of the labyrinth spiral pattern have been found carved into\nstone (Q35)\n, from Sardinia to Scandinavia, from Arizona to India to Africa. In Europe, these spiral carvings date from the late Bronze Age. The Native American Pima tribe wove baskets with a circular labyrinth design that depicted their own cosmology. In Ancient Greece, the labyrinth spiral was used on\ncoins (Q36)\naround four thousand years ago. Labyrinths made of mosaics were commonly found in bathhouses, villas and tombs throughout the Roman Empire.\nIn Northern Europe, there were actual physical labyrinths designed for walking on. These were cut into the turf or grass, usually in a circular pattern. The origin of these walking labyrinths remains unclear, but they were probably used for fertility rites which may date back thousands of years. Eleven examples of turf labyrinths survive today, including the largest one at Saffron Walden, England, which used to have a large\ntree (Q37)\nin the middle of it.\nMore recently labyrinths have experienced something of a revival. Some believe that walking a labyrinth promotes healing and mindfulness, and there are those who believe in its emotional and physical benefits, which include slower\nbreathing (Q38)\nand a restored sense of balance and perspective. This idea has become so popular that labyrinths have been laid into the floors of spas, wellness centres and even prisons in recent years.\nA pamphlet at Colorado Children’s Hospital informs patients that ‘walking a labyrinth can often calm people in the midst of a crisis’. And apparently, it’s not only patients who benefit. Many visitors find walking a labyrinth less stressful than sitting in a corridor or waiting room. Some doctors even walk the labyrinth during their breaks. In some hospitals, patients who can’t walk can have a\npaper (Q39)\n‘finger labyrinth’ brought to their bed. The science behind the theory is a little sketchy, but there are dozens of small-scale studies which support claims about the benefits of labyrinths. For example, one study found that walking a labyrinth provided ‘short-term calming, relaxation, and relief from\nanxiety (Q40)\n’ for Alzheimer’s patients.\nSo, what is it about labyrinths that makes their appeal so universal?

My name’s Frank Pritchard. I’ve just retired and moved to Southoe. I’d like to become a volunteer, and I gather you co-ordinate voluntary work in the village.\nJANE:\nThat’s right.\nFRANK:\nWhat sort of thing could I do?\nJANE:\nWell, we need help with the village library. We borrow books from the town library, and individuals also donate them. So, one thing you could do is get involved in\ncollecting (Q1)\nthem – if you’ve got a car, that is.\nFRANK:\nYes, that’s no problem.\nJANE:\nThe times are pretty flexible so we can arrange it to suit you. Another thing is the\nrecords (Q2)\nthat we keep of the books we’re given, and those we borrow and need to return to the town library. It would be very useful to have another person to help keep them up to date.\nFRANK:\nRight. I’m used to working on a computer – I presume they’re computerised?\nJANE:\nOh yes.\nFRANK:\nIs the library purpose-built? I haven’t noticed it when I’ve walked round the village.\nJANE:\nNo, we simply have the use of a room in the village hall, the\nWest (Q3)\nRoom. It’s on the left as you go in.\nFRANK:\nI must go and have a look inside the hall.\nJANE:\nYes, it’s a nice building.\nFRANK:\nDo you run a lunch club in the village for elderly people? I know a lot of places do.\nJANE:\nYes, we have a very successful club.\nFRANK:\nI could help with\ntransport (Q4)\n, if that’s of any use.\nJANE:\nOoo definitely. People come to the club from neighbouring villages, and we’re always in need of more drivers.\nFRANK:\nAnd does the club have groups that focus on a particular hobby, too? I could get involved in one or two, particularly if there are any\nart (Q5)\ngroups.\nJANE:\nExcellent. I’ll find out where we need help and get back to you.\nFRANK:\nFine. What about help for individual residents. Do you arrange that at all?\nJANE:\nYes, we do it as a one-off. In fact, there’s Mrs Carroll. She needs a lift to the\nhospital (Q6)\nnext week, and we’re struggling to find someone.\nFRANK:\nWhen’s her appointment?\nJANE:\nOn Tuesday. It would take the whole morning.\nFRANK:\nI could do that.\nJANE:\nOh, that would be great. Thank you. And also, next week, we’re arranging to have some work done to Mr Selsbury’s house before he moves, as he isn’t healthy enough to do it himself. We’ve got some people to decorate his kitchen, but if you could do some weeding in his\ngarden (Q7)\n, that would be wonderful.\nFRANK:\nOK. I’d enjoy that. And presumably the day and time are flexible.\nJANE:\nOh yes. Just say when would suit you best, and we’ll let Mr Selsbury know.\nFRANK:\nGood.\nJANE:\nThe volunteers group also organises monthly social events, which is a great way to meet other people, of course.\nFRANK:\nUhuh.\nJANE:\nSo next month, on the 19th of October, we’re holding a\nquiz (Q8)\n– a couple of residents are great at planning unusual ones, and we always fill the village hall.\nFRANK:\nThat sounds like fun. Can I do anything to help?\nJANE:\nWell, because of the number of people, we need plenty of refreshments for halfway through. So, if you could provide any, we’d be grateful.\nFRANK:\nI’m sure I could. I’ll think about what to make, and let you know.\nJANE:\nThank you. Then on November the 18th, we’re holding a dance, also in the village hall. We’ve booked a band that specialises in music of the 1930s – they’ve been before, and we’ve had a lot of requests to bring them back.\nFRANK:\nI’m not really a dancer, but I’d like to do something to help.\nJANE:\nWell, we sell\ntickets (Q9)\nin advance, and having an extra person to check them at the door, as people arrive, would be good – it can be quite a bottleneck if everyone arrives at once!\nFRANK:\nOK, I’m happy with that.\nJANE:\nWe’re also arranging a New Year’s Eve party. We’re expecting that to be a really big event, so instead of the village hall, it’ll be held in the Mountfort Hotel.\nFRANK:\nThe …?\nJANE:\nMountfort. M-O-U-N-T-F-O-R-T Hotel. It isn’t in Southoe itself, but it’s only a couple of miles away. The hotel will be providing dinner and we’ve booked a band. The one thing we haven’t got yet is a\nposter (Q10)\n. That isn’t something you could do, by any chance, is it?\nFRANK:\nWell actually, yes. Before I retired I was a graphic designer, so that’s right up my street.\nJANE:\nOh perfect! I’ll give you the details, and then perhaps you could send me a draft …\nFRANK:\nOf course.\n剑桥雅思17 Test2 Part1雅思听力答案\n1. collecting\n2. records\n3.

My name’s Nick, and I’m one of the guides. I’ll give you a brief introduction to the estate while you’re sitting down, and then we’ll walk round.\nThe estate consists of the house, gardens, parkland and farm, and it dates back to the fourteenth century. The original house was replaced in the late seventeenth century, and of course it has had a large number of owners.\nAlmost all of them have left their mark, generally\nby adding new rooms, like the ballroom and conservatory, or by demolishing others (Q11)\n.\nThe farm looks much as it’s always done, although the current owner has done a great deal of work to the flower beds.\nIn the seventeenth century, the estate was owned by a very wealthy man called Sir Edward Downes. His intention was to escape from the world of politics, after years as an active politician, and to build a new house worthy of his big collection of books, paintings and sculptures. He broke off contact with his former political allies, and\nhosted meetings of creative and literary people, like painters and poets (Q12)\n. Unusually for his time, he didn’t care whether his guests were rich or poor, as long as they had talent.\nBig houses like Oniton had dozens of servants until the 1920s or 30s, and we’ve tried to show what their working lives were like. Photographs of course don’t give much of an idea, so instead, as you go round the house, you’ll see\nvolunteers dressed up as nineteenth-century servants (Q13)\n, going about their work. They’ll explain what they’re doing, and tell you their recipes, or what tools they’re using. We’ve just introduced this feature to replace the audio guide we used to have available.\nI see there are a number of children here with you today. Well, we have several activities specially for children, like dressing up in the sorts of clothes that children wore in the past, and as it’s a fine day, some of you will probably want to play in the adventure playground.\nOur latest addition is child-sized tractors (Q14)\n, that you can drive around the grounds.\nWe’ll also be going into the farm that’s part of the estate, where there’s plenty to do. Most of the buildings date from the eighteenth century, so you can really step back into an agricultural past.\nUntil recently, the dairy was where milk from the cows was turned into cheese.\nIt’s now the place to go for lunch, or afternoon tea, or just a cup of coffee and a slice of homemade cake (Q15)\n.\nThe big stone building that dominates the farm is the large barn, and\nin here is our collection of agricultural tools (Q16)\n. These were used in the past to plough the earth, sow seeds, make gates, and much more.\nThere’s a small barn, also made of stone,\nwhere you can groom the donkeys and horses, to keep their coats clean (Q17)\n. They really seem to enjoy having it done, and children love grooming them.\nThe horses no longer live in the stables, which instead is\nthe place to go to buy gifts, books, our own jams and pickles, and clothes and blankets (Q18)\nmade of wool from our sheep.\nOutside the shed, which is the only brick building,\nyou can climb into a horse-drawn carriage for a lovely, relaxing tour (Q19)\nof the park and farm. The carriages are well over a hundred years old.\nAnd finally, the parkland, which was laid out in the eighteenth century, with a lake and trees that are now well established.\nYou’ll see types of cattle and sheep that are hardly ever found\non farms these days (Q20)\n. We’re helping to preserve them, to stop their numbers falling further.\nOK, well if you’d like to come with me …\n剑桥雅思17 Test2 Part2雅思听力答案\n11. B\n12. C\n13. C\n14. B\n15. D\n16. C\n17. G\n18. A\n19.

This article is from laokaoya website. These were used in the past to plough the earth, sow seeds, make gates, and much more.\n答案解析：Large barn里放着农具。它们过去被用于耕地，播种，制造大门等等。C选项old对应were used，farming对应agricultural，equipment对应tools，由此确定其为正确答案。\n第17题答案：G\n对应原文：There’s a small barn, also made of stone, where you can groom the donkeys and horses, to keep their coats clean\n答案解析：在small barn里，游客可以给驴和马梳毛，保持它们皮毛整洁干净。G选项look after对应groom和keep clean，animals对应donkeys and horses，由此确定其为正确答案。\n第18题答案：A\n对应原文： the place to go to buy gifts, books, our own jams and pickles, and clothes and blankets\n答案解析：Stables是购买礼物，图书，果酱，衣服和毯子的地方。A选项shopping对应buy，由此确定其为正确答案。\n第19题答案：E\n对应原文：you can climb into a horse-drawn carriage for a lovely, relaxing tour\n答案解析：在shed这个地方，游客可以乘坐马车，开启一段放松身心的旅程。E选项trip对应tour，由此确定其为正确答案。\n第20题答案：F\n对应原文：You’ll see types of cattle and sheep that are hardly ever found on farms these days\n答案解析：在parkland，游客可以看到如今在农场里很少见的牛和羊。F选项rare对应hardly ever found，breeds of animals对应cattle and sheep，由此确定其为正确答案。"

I found it quite hard though. I kept getting too involved in the play.\nED:\nMe too. I ended up not taking notes. I wrote down my impressions when I got home. Do you mind if I check a few things with you? In case I’ve missed anything. And I’ve also got some questions about our assignment.\nGEMMA:\nNo, it’s good to talk things through. I may have missed things too.\nED:\nOK great. So first of all, I’m not sure how much information we should include in our reviews.\nGEMMA:\nRight. Well, I don’t think we need to describe what happens. Especially as\nRomeo and Juliet\nis one of Shakespeare’s most well-known plays.\nED:\nYeah, everyone knows the story. In an essay we’d focus on the poetry and Shakespeare’s use of imagery etc., but that isn’t really relevant in a review. We’re supposed to focus on how effective this particular production is.\nGEMMA:\nMmm. We should say what made it a success or a failure.\nED:\nAnd part of that means talking about\nthe emotional impact the performance had on us (Q21)\n. I think that’s important.\nGEMMA:\nYes. And we should definitely mention\nhow well the director handled important\nbits of the play – like when Romeo climbs onto Juliet’s balcony (Q22)\n.\nED:\nAnd\nthe fight between Mercutio and Tybalt (Q22)\n.\nGEMMA:\nYes. It would also be interesting to mention the theatre space how the director used it but I don’t think we’ll have space in 800 words.\nED:\nNo. OK. That all sounds quite straightforward.\nED:\nSo what about The Emporium Theatre’s production of the play?\nGEMMA:\nI thought some things worked really well but there were some problems too.\nED:\nYeah. What about the set, for example?\nGEMMA:\nI think\nit was visually really stunning (Q23)\n. I’d say that was probably the most memorable thing about this production.\nED:\nYou’re right.\nThe set design was really amazing (Q23)\n, but actually I have seen similar ideas used in other productions.\nGEMMA:\nWhat about the lighting? Some of the scenes were so dimly lit it was quite hard to see.\nED:\nI didn’t\ndislike\nit.\nIt helped to change the mood of the quieter scenes (Q24)\n.\nGEMMA:\nThat’s a good point.\nED:\nWhat did you think of the costumes?\nGEMMA:\nI was a bit surprised by the contemporary dress (Q25)\n, I must say.\nED:\nYeah – I think it worked well, but\nI had assumed it would be more conventional (Q25)\n.\nGEMMA:\nMe too. I liked the music at the beginning and I thought the musicians were brilliant, but\nI thought they were wasted because the music didn’t have much\nimpact in Acts 2 and 3 (Q26)\n.\nED:\nYes –\nthat was a shame (Q26)\n.\nGEMMA:\nOne problem with this production was that the actors didn’t deliver the lines that well.\nThey were speaking too fast (Q27)\n.\nED:\nIt was a problem I agree, but I thought it was\nbecause they weren’t speaking\nloudly enough – especially at key points in the play (Q27)\n.\nGEMMA:\nI actually didn’t have a problem with that.\nED:\nIt’s been an interesting experience watching different versions of\nRomeo and\nJuliet\n, hasn’t it?\nGEMMA:\nDefinitely. It’s made me realise how relevant the play still is.\nED:\nRight. I mean a lot’s changed since Shakespeare’s time, but in many ways nothing’s changed.\nThere are always disagreements and tension between teenagers and their parents (Q28)\n.\nGEMMA:\nYes, that’s something all young people can relate to – more than the violence and the extreme emotions in the play.\nED:\nHow did you find watching it in translation?\nGEMMA:\nReally interesting. I expected to find it more challenging, but I could follow the story pretty well.\nED:\nI stopped worrying about not being able to understand all the words and focused on the actors’ expressions.\nThe ending was pretty powerful (Q29)\n.\nGEMMA:\nYes.\nThat somehow intensified the emotion for me (Q29)\n.\nED:\nDid you know Shakespeare’s been translated into more languages than any other writer?\nGEMMA:\nWhat’s the reason for his international appeal, do you think?\nED:\nI was reading that it’s because his plays are about basic themes that people everywhere are familiar with.\nGEMMA:\nYeah, and\nthey can also be understood on different levels (Q30)\n.

I’d say that was probably the most memorable thing about this production.\nED:\nYou’re right. The set design was really amazing\n答案解析：对于场景布置，Gemma和ED都给予很高的评价，使用了诸如stunning，amazing这样子的词汇。而且Gemma还表示这是整部剧最值得记忆的点。D选项major strength对应the most memorable thing，由此确定其为正确答案。\n第24题答案：C\n对应原文：\nED:\nI didn’t\ndislike\nit. It helped to change the mood of the quieter scenes.\nGEMMA:\nThat’s a good point.\n答案解析：虽然Gemma一开始认为灯光太暗，看不清楚。但在ED说完自己的意见 – 这样可以帮助营造情绪之后，她又表示了认同。C选项the right atmosphere对应the mood of the quieter scenes，由此确定其为正确答案。\n第25题答案：A\n对应原文：\nGEMMA:\nI was a bit surprised by the contemporary dress, I must say.\nED:\nYeah – I think it worked well, but I had assumed it would be more conventional\n答案解析：Gemma对演员的现代着装表示惊讶，而ED也说，他本以为服装会更传统一些的。A选项more traditional对应more conventional，由此确定其为正确答案。\n第26题答案：E\n对应原文：I thought they were wasted because the music didn’t have much impact in Acts 2 and 3\n答案解析：Gemma认为演奏者有些浪费，因为音乐对第二幕和第三幕并没有什么影响，而ED则表示赞同。虽然原文中并没有什么特别文章来自老烤鸭雅思能对应disappointed的词汇。但选项中只有E能够大致概括出他们的情绪，由此确定其为正确答案。\n第27题答案：F\n对应原文：\nGEMMA:\nOne problem with this production was that the actors didn’t deliver the lines that well. They were speaking too fast\nED:\nIt was a problem I agree, but I thought it was because they weren’t speaking loudly enough – especially at key points in the play\n答案解析：Gemma和ED都认为演员的台词有问题，但Gemma觉得这是因为他们说的太快，而ED则觉得这是因为他们的声音不够大。即在产生问题的原因上无法达成一致，由此确定F为正确答案。\n第28题答案：B\n对应原文：There are always disagreements and tension between teenagers and their parents\n答案解析：这道题几乎没有设置什么干扰项（只有后面的violence勉强可以对应A选项中的conflict），只要大家听到parents，应该就能很轻松的确定B为正确答案。\n第29题答案：C\n对应原文：That somehow intensified the emotion for me\n答案解析：另外一种语言的罗密欧与朱丽叶并没有造成任何理解障碍，反而让情感更为充沛。C选项moving对应intensified the emotion，由此确定其为正确答案。\n第30题答案：C\n对应原文：\nGEMMA:\nYeah, and they can also be understood on different levels. The characters have such depth.\nED:\nRight – which allows directors to experiment and find new angles\n答案解析：录音中虽然确实提到了角色，但重点强调的是角色的深度，而非可辨识，因此排除B。C选项interpreted对应undertood和experiment，而in many ways对应different levels和new angles，由此确定其为正确答案。"

Over the past few sessions, we’ve been considering the reasons why some world languages are in decline, and today I’m going to introduce another factor that affects languages, and the speakers of those languages, and that’s technology and, in particular, digital technology. In order to illustrate its effect, I’m going to focus on the Icelandic language, which is spoken by around\n321,000 (Q31)\npeople, most of whom live in Iceland – an island in the North Atlantic Ocean.\nThe problem for this language is not the number of speakers – even though this number is small. Nor is it about losing words to other languages, such as English. In fact, the\nvocabulary (Q32)\nof Icelandic is continually increasing because when speakers need a new word for something, they tend to create one, rather than borrowing from another language. All this makes Icelandic quite a special language – it’s changed very little in the past millennium, yet it can handle twenty-first-century concepts related to the use of computers and digital technology. Take, for example, the word for web browser … this is\nvafri\nin Icelandic, which comes from the verb ‘to wander’. I can’t think of a more appropriate term because that’s exactly what you do mentally when you browse the internet. Then there’s an Icelandic word for\npodcast (Q33)\n– which is too hard to pronounce! And so on.\nIcelandic, then, is alive and growing, but – and it’s a big but – young Icelanders spend a great deal of time in the digital world and this world is predominantly English. Think about\nsmartphones (Q34)\n. They didn’t even exist until comparatively recently, but today young people use them all the time to read books, watch TV or films, play games, listen to music, and so on. Obviously, this is a good thing in many respects because it promotes their\nbilingual (Q35)\nskills, but the extent of the influence of English in the virtual world is staggering and it’s all happening really fast.\nFor their parents and grandparents, the change is less concerning because they already have their native-speaker skills in Icelandic. But for young speakers – well, the outcome is a little troubling. For example, teachers have found that\nplayground (Q36)\nconversations in Icelandic secondary schools can be conducted entirely in English, while teachers of much younger children have reported situations where their classes find it easier to say what is in a\npicture (Q37)\nusing English, rather than Icelandic. The very real and worrying consequence of all this is that the\nyoung\ngeneration in Iceland is at risk of losing its mother tongue.\nOf course, this is happening to other European languages too, but while internet companies might be willing to offer, say, French options in their systems, it’s much harder for them to justify the expense of doing the same for a language  that has a population the size of a French town, such as Nice. The other drawback of Icelandic is the\ngrammar (Q38)\n, which is significantly more complex than in most languages. At the moment, the tech giants are simply not interested in tackling this.\nSo, what is the Icelandic government doing about this? Well, large sums of money are being allocated to a language technology fund that it is hoped will lead to the development of Icelandic sourced apps and other social media and digital systems, but clearly this is going to be an uphill struggle.\nOn the positive side, they know that Icelandic is still the official language of education and government. It has survived for well over a thousand years and the experts predict that its future in this nation state is sound and will continue to be so. However, there’s no doubt that it’s becoming an inevitable second choice in young people’s lives.\nThis raises important questions. When you consider how much of the past is tied up in a language, will young Icelanders lose their sense of their own\nidentity (Q39)\n? Another issue that concerns the government of Iceland is this. If children are learning two languages through different routes, neither of which they are fully\nfluent (Q40)\nin, will they be able to express themselves properly?\n剑桥雅思17 Test2 Part4雅思听力答案\n31. 321000\n32. vocabulary\n33. podcast\n34. smartphones\n35. bilingual\n36. playground\n37. picture\n38. grammar\n39. identity\n40. fluent"

In fact, the\nvocabulary\nof Icelandic is continually increasing\n答案解析：完全没有关键词或者顺序连接词提示大家32题即将到来，听到still growing，意识到到它与continually increasing对应，答案已经出现，然后通过回想锁定vocabulary，比较考验大家的短期记忆能力。\n第33题答案：podcast\n对应原文： Then there’s an Icelandic word for\npodcast\n– which is too hard to pronounce! And so on.\n答案解析：考察并列关系。录音在说完web browser之后加了好几句解释。这个时候我们不要慌，听到then才能确定并列项即将出现，由此锁定podcast。\n第34题答案：smartphones\n对应原文：young Icelanders spend a great deal of time in the digital world this article is from laokaoya website and this world is predominantly English. Think about\nsmartphones\n答案解析：录音中的young对应小标题，提示我们答案即将到来。从题干可以推测出空上应该填某种具体的数码科技，再加上think about与such as的对应，由此锁定smartphones。\n第35题答案：bilingual\n对应原文：Obviously, this is a good thing in many respects because it promotes their\nbilingual\nskills\n答案解析：同样是没有任何提示词，只能根据词性和句义去找答案，难度极大。\n第36题答案：playground\n对应原文：For example, teachers have found that\nplayground\nconversations in Icelandic secondary schools can be conducted entirely in English\n答案解析：这道题采用语序颠倒的手法，将原本位于空前的English放在句子末尾，听到时答案很有可能已经回忆不起来了。不过我们在读题的时候，可以根据in文章来自老烤鸭雅思和后面的at school猜测出答案应该是学校的某处地点，由此锁定playground。\n第37题答案：picture\n对应原文： their classes find it easier to say what is in a\npicture\nusing English, rather than Icelandic.\n答案解析：录音中easier对应better，say对应identify，what对应content，using对应in，English是原词。整体句子结构没有太大的更改。因此虽然没有明确的提示词，但还是比较容易锁定picture的。\n第38题答案：grammar\n对应原文：The other drawback of Icelandic is the\ngrammar\n, which is significantly more complex than in most languages.\n答案解析：同样是采用语序颠倒的手法，将空前修饰词complicated的同义替换complex放在答案之后。不过这道题有the other drawback（对应and）提示我们答案即将到来。相比于前面的题目还算稍微简单一些。\n第39题答案：identity\n对应原文：will young Icelanders lose their sense of their own\nidentity\n？\n答案解析：听到young Icelanders意识到答案即将到来，空前词lose没有任何更改，很容易锁定identity。\n第40题答案：fluent\n对应原文：If children are learning two languages through different routes, neither of which they are fully\nfluent\nin, will they be able to express themselves properly?\n答案解析：又是一道没有明确提示词的题目，只能根据空前否定not与neither的同义替换和词性来确定答案为fluent。"

I’d thoroughly recommend it. I think it’s the kind of holiday all the\nfamily (Q1)\ncan enjoy together. The thing about surfing is that it’s great for all ages and all abilities. My youngest started when he was only three!\nWOMAN:\nWow! But it’s quite physically demanding, isn’t it? I’ve heard you need to be pretty\nfit (Q2)\n.\nJAKE:\nYes. You’ll certainly learn more quickly and won’t tire as easily.\nWOMAN:\nWell – that should be OK for us. You’ve been surfing a few times in Ireland, haven’t you?\nJAKE:\nYes. There’s some great surfing there, which people don’t always realise.\nWOMAN:\nAnd which locations would you recommend? – there seem to be quite a few.\nJAKE:\nYes, there are loads. Last year we went to County Donegal. There are several great places to surf there.\nWOMAN:\nWhat about in County Clare? I read that’s also really good for surfing.\nJAKE:\nYes, it is. I’ve been there a few times. Most people go to Lahinch. My kids love it there. The waves aren’t too challenging and the town is very lively.\nWOMAN:\nAre there good\nhotels (Q3)\nthere?\nJAKE:\nYes – some very nice ones and there are also a few basic hostels and campsites. It’s great if you need lessons as the surf schools are excellent.\nWOMAN:\nSounds good.\nJAKE:\nYes and there’s lots to see in the area – like those well-known cliffs – … I’ve forgotten the name of them …\nWOMAN:\nOh don’t worry – I can look them up.\nJAKE:\nI’ve also been surfing in County Mayo, which is less well-known for surfing, but we had a really good time. That was a few years ago when the kids were younger. There’s a good surf school at Carrowniskey beach.\nWOMAN:\nHow do you spell that?\nJAKE:\nC-A-double R-O-W-N-I-S-K-E-Y (Q4)\nWOMAN:\nOK\nJAKE:\nI put the kids into the surf camp they run during the summer for 10–16 year olds.\nWOMAN:\nOh right. How long was that for?\nJAKE:\nThree hours every day for a\nweek (Q5)\n. It was perfect – they were so tired out after that.\nWOMAN:\nI can imagine.\nJAKE:\nOne thing we did while the kids were surfing was to rent some kayaks to have a look around the\nbay (Q6)\nwhich is nearby. It’s really beautiful.\nWOMAN:\nOh, I’d love to do that.\nWOMAN:\nNow the only time I went to Ireland it rained practically every day.\nJAKE:\nMmm yes – that can be a problem – but you can surf in the rain, you know.\nWOMAN:\nIt doesn’t have the same appeal, somehow.\nJAKE:\nWell, the weather’s been fine the last couple of years when I’ve been there, but actually, it tends to rain more in August than in the spring or autumn.\nSeptember (Q7)\nis my favourite month because the water is warmer then.\nWOMAN:\nThe only problem is that the kids are back to school then.\nJAKE:\nI know. But one good thing about Irish summers is that it doesn’t get\ntoo\nhot. The average temperature is about\n19 (Q8)\ndegrees and it usually doesn’t go above 25 degrees.\nWOMAN:\nThat sounds alright. Now what about costs?\nJAKE:\nSurfing is a pretty cheap holiday really – the only cost is the hire of equipment. You can expect to pay a daily rate of about\n30 (Q9)\neuros for the hire of a wetsuit and board – but you can save about 40 euros if you hire by the week.\nWOMAN:\nThat’s not too bad.\nJAKE:\nNo. It’s important to make sure you get good quality wetsuits – you’ll all get too cold if you don’t. And make sure you also get\nboots (Q10)\n. They keep your feet warm and it’s easier to surf with them on too.\nWOMAN:\nWell, thanks very much …\n剑桥雅思17 Test3 Part1雅思听力答案\n1. family\n2. fit\n3. hotels\n4. Carrowniskey\n5. week\n6. bay\n7.

My name’s Mrs Carter and I run the before and after school extended hours childcare service. I hope you’ve had a chance to have a good look around the school and talk to staff and pupils. I know that many of you are interested in using our childcare service when your child joins the school, and perhaps you already know something about it, but for those that don’t, I’ll go through the main details now.\nWe offer childcare for children from the ages of four to eleven both before and after school. I know that many parents who work find this service invaluable. You can leave your child with us safe in the knowledge that they will be extremely well cared for.\nWe are insured to provide care for up to 70 children (Q11)\n, although we rarely have this many attending at any one session.\nI think we generally expect around 50–60 children for the\nafternoon sessions and about half that number for the breakfast sessions (Q12)\n. Although we currently do have 70 children registered with us, not all of these attend every day. It’s ten years since we began offering an extended hours service and we’ve come a long way during that time. When we first opened, we only had about 20 children attending regularly.\nWe try to keep our costs as low as we can and we think we provide very good value for money.\nFor the afternoon sessions, which run from 3.30 until 6 p.m., it’s £7.20 (Q13)\n. But if you prefer, you can pay for one hour only, which costs £3.50, or two hours which costs £5.70.\nThe cost of the childcare includes food and snacks. They’ll be given breakfast in the morning and in the afternoon, a healthy snack as soon as they finish school.\nAt 5 p.m. children are given something more substantial, such as pasta or a casserole (Q14)\n. Please inform us of any allergies that your child might have and we’ll make sure they’re offered a suitable alternative.\nAs you may know, the childcare service runs through the school holidays from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. We offer a really varied and exciting programme to keep the children entertained – we don’t want them to feel as if they are still at school! It will also feel different because\nthey’ll get the chance to make new friends with children from other schools (Q15)\n– spaces are available for them because a lot of our term-time children don’t always attend during the holiday. In the past, parents have asked if children over the age of 11 are allowed to come with their younger brothers and sisters – but I’m afraid we’re unable to do this because of the type of insurance we have.\nSo now let me tell you about some of the activities that your child can do during the after school sessions. As well as being able to use the playground equipment, computers and the library, there is usually at least one ‘special’ activity that children can do each day. For example, Spanish. We have a specialist teacher coming in every Thursday to give a basic introduction to the language through games and songs. She does two sessions: one for the over 8s and one for the younger children.\nThis is the only activity which we have to make an extra charge for (Q16)\n– but it’s well worth it.\nOnce a week the children have the opportunity to do some music. We’re very lucky that one of our staff is a member of a folk band. On Mondays, she teaches singing and percussion to groups of children.\nWe do rely on parental support for this (Q17)\n, so if any of you sing or play an instrument and would be prepared to help out at these sessions, we’d be delighted.\nPainting continues to be one of the most popular activities. To begin with we weren’t keen on offering this because of the extra mess involved,\nbut children kept asking if they could do\nsome art (Q18)\nand so we finally gave in. Art is great for helping the children to relax after working hard at school all day.\nYoga is something that we’ve been meaning to introduce for some time but haven’t been able to find anyone available to teach it – until now that is (Q19)\n. So we’ll see how this goes. Hopefully, children will benefit in all sorts of ways from this.\nCooking is another popular activity. They make a different sort of cake, or pizza or bread each week. Although the younger children love doing it, we found that the mess was just too much,\nso we’ve decided to restrict this to the over 8s (Q20)\n, as they are better able to clean up after themselves\n剑桥雅思17 Test3 Part2雅思听力答案\n11-12.

The event I’ll be managing is one where I’m helping to set up a sports competition for primary school children.\nTutor:\nYup. That’s always a popular placement – even though it can be tougher than you think working with children.\nHolly:\nI know, but\nit’s the fresh air that attracts me – organising something indoors doesn’t have the same appeal (Q21)\n, even though it might be fun.\nTutor:\nOK, so obviously safety’s going to be one of your key concerns for this event.\nHolly:\nYes, I’ve already thought about that. I’ll need to make sure none of the equipment’s damaged.\nTutor:\nAh well, you’ll be working with schools, so the equipment will be their responsibility. However, the grounds and what goes on there will be yours.\nHolly:\nOh I see –\nthat’ll include keeping everyone within the boundary (Q22)\nonce they’re in their kit and on the field?\nTutor:\nExactly – you’ll need to inspect areas like changing rooms as well for anything someone can trip over,\nbut your main priority will be not to lose anyone (Q22)\n!\nHolly:\nRight. I’ll need staff to help with that.\nTutor:\nAnd don’t forget about the spectators.\nHolly:\nMmm. I was thinking that many of them will be parents, who could help run the event.\nTutor:\nI wouldn’t rely on that. They’ll be more interested in filming their children than volunteering.\nHolly:\nI’ll need to make sure they don’t interfere with events doing that (Q23)\n!\nTutor:\nAnd that’s not always easy (Q23)\n, especially when a proud parent’s trying to get a snap of their child and you want them to move elsewhere.\nHolly:\nOK. What about the scheduling?\nTutor:\nWith sporting events there are all sorts of things that can alter the timetable – like rain, for instance – though so far, we’ve always been lucky with that.\nHolly:\nYeah, and I was thinking about\nwhat to do if someone got hurt as well. I know that last year that caused a terrible delay (Q24)\n.\nTutor:\nYou have to be prepared for such things.\nHolly:\nOh. What if a match ends in a draw – do you let the teams keep going until someone wins?\nTutor:\nThat’ll be up to you – and again, you need to plan for it.\nHolly:\nRight.\nTutor:\nNow, the aim of your work placement is to give you the opportunity to develop the skills that an events manager needs. So, let’s talk about those a bit.\nHolly:\nWell, I think my communication skills are pretty good. I can talk on the phone to people and book venues and that kind of thing.\nTutor:\nGood – just remember it isn’t only about what you say.\nIf you meet someone face-to-face and want to persuade them to be a sponsor (Q25)\n, for example …\nHolly:\nOh,\nI’ll dress up for that (Q25)\n! Sure.\nTutor:\nGood. Let’s go on to think about your organisational skills. You’re working in a very people-based industry and that means things won’t always go to plan.\nHolly:\nI guess\nit’s being prepared to make changes that matters (Q26)\n.\nTutor:\nThat’s right. You may have to make an on-the-spot change to a timetable because of a problem you hadn’t anticipated …\nHolly:\n… just do it! OK.\nTutor:\nHow’s your time management these days?\nHolly:\nI’m working on it – I’m certainly better when I have a deadline, which is why this work suits me.\nTutor:\nYes, but it’s how you respond as that deadline approaches!\nHolly:\nI know I’ve got to look calm even if I’m in a panic (Q27)\n.\nTutor:\nJust think to yourself – no one must know I’m under pressure.\nHolly:\nYeah – even though I’m multi-tasking like crazy!\nTutor:\nAnother skill that events managers need is creativity. Often your client has what we call the ‘big picture’ idea, but it’s up to the events manager to\nthink of all the fine points that go to making it work (Q28)\n.\nHolly:\nRight, so I need to listen carefully to that idea and then fill in all the gaps.\nTutor:\nThat’s right. And you’ll have a team working under you,  so another key skill is leadership. Your team may have lots of ideas too, but you’ve got to make the ultimate choices. Do we have refreshments inside or out, for example?\nHolly:\nIsn’t it better to be democratic?\nTutor:\nIt’s a nice idea, but you have the ultimate responsibility. So,\nbelieve in what\nyou\nthink best (Q29)\n. Be prepared to say ‘yes’, that’s a good idea but it won’t work here.\nHolly:\nI see what you mean. What about the networking side of things? I know it’s an area that a lot of students worry about because we don’t have much experience to offer others.\nTutor:\nBut even without it – you can still be an interesting person with useful ideas. And the more people you impress, the better.\nHolly:\nI guess that will help me when I apply for a real job.\nTutor:\nExactly – think ahead (Q30)\n– remember what your ambitions are and keep them in mind.\nHolly:\nDefinitely\n剑桥雅思17 Test3 Part3雅思听力答案\n21.

Some travel seasonally for relatively short distances, such as birds that move from their winter habitats in lowlands to mountain tops for the summers. Others, like the Arctic Tern, travel more than 25,000 miles seasonally between the northern and southern poles. Bird migration has been studied over many centuries through a variety of observations.\nBut until relatively recently, where birds went to in the winter was considered something of a mystery. The lack of modern science and technology led to many theories that we now recognize as error-filled and even somewhat amusing. Take hibernation theory for example – two thousand years ago, it was commonly believed that when birds left an area, they went underwater to hibernate in the seas and oceans. Another theory for the regular appearance and disappearance of birds was that they spent winter hidden in\nmud (Q31)\ntill the weather changed and food became abundant again. The theory that some birds hibernate persisted until experiments were done on caged birds in the 1940s which demonstrated that birds have no hibernation instinct.\nOne of the earliest naturalists and philosophers from ancient Greece was Aristotle who was the first writer to discuss the disappearance and reappearance of some bird species at certain times of year. He developed the theory of transmutation, the seasonal change of one species into another, by observing redstarts and robins. He observed that in the autumn, small birds called ‘redstarts’ began to lose their\nfeathers (Q32)\n, which convinced Aristotle that they changed into robins for the winter, and back into redstarts in the summer. These assumptions are understandable given that this pair of species are similar in\nshape (Q33)\n, but are a classic example of an incorrect interpretation based on correct observations.\nThe most bizarre theory was put forward by an English amateur scientist, Charles Morton, in the seventeenth century. He wrote a surprisingly well-regarded paper  claiming that birds migrate to the\nmoon (Q34)\nand back every year. He came to this conclusion as the only logical explanation for the total disappearance of some species.\nOne of the key moments in the development of migration theory came in 1822 when a white stork was shot in Germany. This particular stork made history because of the long spear in its\nneck (Q35)\nwhich incredibly had not killed it – everyone immediately realised this spear was definitely not European. It turned out to be a spear from a tribe in Central Africa. This was a truly defining moment in the history of ornithology because it was the first\nevidence (Q36)\nthat storks spend their winters in sub-aharan Africa. You can still see the ‘arrow stork’ in the Zoological Collection of the University of Rostock in Germany.\nPeople gradually became aware that European birds moved south in autumn and north in summer but didn’t know much about it until the practice of catching birds and putting rings on their legs became established. Before this, very little information was available about the actual\ndestinations (Q37)\nof particular species and how they travelled there. People speculated that larger birds provided a kind of taxi service for smaller birds by carrying them on their backs. This idea came about because it seemed impossible that small birds weighing only a few grams could fly over vast\noceans (Q38)\n. This idea was supported by observations of bird behaviour such as the harassment of larger birds by smaller birds.\nThe development of bird ringing, by a Danish schoolteacher, Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen, made many discoveries possible. This is still common practice today and relies upon what is known as\n‘recovery’ (Q39)\n– this is when ringed birds are found dead in the place they have migrated to, and identified. Huge amounts of data were gathered in the early part of the twentieth century and for the first time in history people understood where birds actually went to in winter. In 1931, an\natlas (Q40)\nwas published showing where the most common species of European birds migrated to. More recent theories about bird migration …\n剑桥雅思17 Test3 Part4雅思听力答案\n31. mud\n32. feathers\n33. shape\n34. moon\n35. neck\n36. evidence\n37. destinations\n38. oceans\n39. recovery\n40. atlas"

I’m looking for a cleaning service for my apartment – do you do domestic cleaning?\nJACINTA:\nSure.\nCLIENT:\nWell, it’s just a one-bedroom flat. Do you have a basic cleaning package?\nJACINTA:\nYes. For a one-bedroom flat we’re probably looking at about two hours for a clean. So we’d do a thorough clean of all surfaces in each room,  and polish them where necessary. Does your apartment have carpets?\nCLIENT:\nNo, I don’t have any, but the\nfloor (Q1)\nwould need cleaning.\nJACINTA:\nOf course – we’d do that in every room. And we’d do a thorough clean of the kitchen and bathroom.\nCLIENT:\nOK.\nJACINTA:\nThen we have some additional services which you can request if you want – so for example, we can clean your oven for you every week.\nCLIENT:\nActually, I hardly ever use that, but can you do the\nfridge(Q2)\n?\nJACINTA:\nSure. Would you like that done every week?\nCLIENT:\nYes, definitely. And would ironing clothes be an additional service you can do?\nJACINTA:\nYes, of course.\nCLIENT:\nIt wouldn’t be much, just my\nshirts (Q3)\nfor work that week.\nJACINTA:\nThat’s fine. And we could also clean your microwave if you want.\nCLIENT:\nNo, I wipe that out pretty regularly so there’s no need for that.\nJACINTA:\nWe also offer additional services that you might want a bit less often, say every month. So for example, if the inside of your\nwindows (Q4)\nneed cleaning, we could do that.\nCLIENT:\nYes, that’d be good. I’m on the fifteenth floor, so the outside gets done regularly by specialists, but the inside does get a bit grubby.\nJACINTA:\nAnd we could arrange for your curtains to get cleaned if necessary.\nCLIENT:\nNo, they’re OK. But would you be able to do something about the\nbalcony (Q5)\n? It’s quite small and I don’t use it much, but it could do with a wash every month or so.\nJACINTA:\nYes, we can get the pressure washer onto that.\nJACINTA:\nNow if you’re interested, we do offer some other possibilities to do with general maintenance. For example, if you have a problem with water and you need a plumber in a hurry, we can put you in touch with a reliable one who can come out straightaway. And the same thing if you need an\nelectrician (Q6)\n.\nCLIENT:\nRight. That’s good to know. I’ve only just moved here so I don’t have any of those sorts of contacts.\nJACINTA:\nAnd I don’t know if this is of interest to you, but we also offer a special vacuum cleaning system which can improve the indoor air quality of your home by capturing up to 99% of all the\ndust (Q7)\nin the air. So if you’re troubled by allergies, this can make a big difference.\nCLIENT:\nRight. In fact, I don’t have that sort of problem, but I’ll bear it in mind. Now can you tell me a bit about your cleaning staff?\nJACINTA:\nOf course. So all our cleaners are very carefully selected. When they apply to us, they have to undergo a security check with the\npolice (Q8)\nto make sure they don’t have any sort of criminal background, and, of course, they have to provide references as well. Then if we think they might be suitable for the job, we give them\ntraining (Q9)\nfor it. That lasts for two weeks so it’s very thorough, and at the end of it, they have a test. If they pass that, we take them on, but we monitor them very carefully – we ask all our clients to complete a\nreview (Q10)\nof their performance after every visit and to email it to us. So we can pick up any problems straightaway and deal with them.\nCLIENT:\nOK, well that all sounds good. And will I always have the same cleaner?\nJACINTA:\nYes, we do our best to organise it that way, and we usually manage it.\nCLIENT:\nGood. That’s fine. Right, so I’d like to go ahead and …\n剑桥雅思17 Test4 Part1雅思听力答案\n1. floor(s)\n2. fridge\n3. shirts\n4. windows\n5. balcony\n6. electrician\n7. dust\n8. police\n9. training\n10. review"

But would you be able to do something about the\nbalcony\n答案解析：跟第1题和第2题相同的套路。Jacinta表示她们可以清洗地毯，而顾客则表示他不需要，而是要清晰阳台，由此确定balcony为答案。\n第6题答案：electrician\n对应原文：you need a plumber in a hurry, we can put you in touch with a reliable one this article is from laokaoya website who can come out straightaway.

So if you’re troubled by allergies, this can make a big difference\n答案解析：同样是采用语序颠倒的手法，将原本位于空前的allergic放在了答案之后，需要大家有较强的短期记忆能力，或者能够事先猜测出空上应该某种物品。\n第8题答案：police\n对应原文： they have to undergo a security check with the\npolice\nto make sure they don’t have any sort of criminal\n答案解析：听到check意识到答案即将到来，从题干可以推测出空上应该填执行这项任务的人或者机构，由此锁定police为正确答案。\n第9题答案：training\n对应原文：Then if we think they might be suitable for the job, we give them\ntraining\nfor it. That lasts for two weeks so it’s very thorough\n答案解析：这道题比较简单一些，根据空前提示词give，可以很容易锁定training。\n第10题答案：review\n对应原文： but we monitor them very carefully – we ask all our clients to complete a\nreview\nof their performance after every visit\n答案解析：这道题没有明显的提示词，根据词性筛选出clients, review, performance, visit之后，发现只有review填上去语义合适，由此确定其为正确答案。"

Every hotel relies on having loyal and experienced members of staff who make sure that everything runs smoothly. If staff are constantly changing, it can make life difficult for everyone. But why do staff leave frequently in many hotels? Of course, many hotel jobs, such as cleaning, are low-skilled and are not well-paid. A lot of managers think it’s this and the long hours that are the main causes of high staff turnover – but what they don’t realise is that\nit’s the lack of training in many hotel\njobs which is a huge factor (Q11)\n.\nSo, what kind of problems does a high turnover of staff cause? Well,\nhaving to recruit new staff all the time can be very time-consuming, and managers may have to cover some duties while waiting for new staff to arrive (Q12)\n. This means they don’t have time to think about less immediate problems such as how to improve their service. When staff leave, it can also severely affect the colleagues they leave behind. It has a negative effect on remaining staff, who may start to feel that they too should be thinking about leaving.\nSo, what can be done to change this situation? Firstly, managers should stop making basic errors which leave their staff feeling upset and resentful. When organising shifts, for example,\nmake sure you never give certain staff preferential treatment. All staff should be given some choice about when they work (Q13)\n, and everyone should have to work some evening and weekend shifts. If you treat staff fairly, they’ll be more likely to step in and help when extra staff are needed.\nKeeping staff happy has other tangible benefits for the business. Take the Dunwich Hotel as an example. It had been experiencing a problem with staff complaints and in order to deal with this, invested in staff training and improved staff conditions. Not only did the level of complaints fall, but\nthey also noticed a significant increase in the amount each customer spent during their stay (Q14)\n. They have now introduced a customer loyalty scheme which is going really well.\nNow I’d like to look at some ways you can reduce staff turnover in your hotels, and I’ll do this by giving some examples of hotels where I’ve done some training recently.\nThe Sun Club received feedback which showed that staff thought managers didn’t value their opinions.\nThey weren’t made to feel they were partners who were contributing to the success of the business as a whole. This situation has changed. Junior staff at all levels are regularly invited to meetings where their ideas are welcomed (Q15)\n.\nA year ago, The Portland recognised the need to invest in staff retention. Their first step was to introduce a scheme for recognising talent amongst their employees.\nThe hope is that organising training for individuals with management potential (Q16)\nwill encourage them to stay with the business.\nAt Bluewater, managers decided to recognise 50 high achievers from across the company’s huge hotel chain.\nAs a reward, they’re sent on an all-expenses-paid trip abroad every year (Q17)\n. Fun is an important element in the trips, but there’s also the opportunity to learn something useful. This year’s trip included a visit to a brewery, where staff learned about the new beer that would be served in the hotel.\nPentlow Hotels identified that retention of junior reception staff was an issue.\nIn order to encourage them to see that working in a hotel could be worthwhile and rewarding, with good prospects, they introduced a management programme (Q18)\n. These staff were given additional responsibilities and the chance to work in various roles in the hotel.\nGreen Planet wanted to be seen as a caring employer. To make life easier for staff, many of whom had childcare responsibilities,\nthe hotel began issuing vouchers to help cover the cost of childcare (Q19)\n.\nLouise Marsh at The Amesbury has one of the best staff retention rates in the business. Since she joined the company, she has made a huge effort to achieve this\nby creating a co-operative and supportive environment. For her, the staff are part of a large family where everyone is valued (Q20)\n.\nOK, now I’d like to …\n剑桥雅思17 Test4 Part2雅思听力答案\n11. A\n12. A\n13. A\n14. C\n15. A\n16. C\n17. B\n18. C\n19. B\n20. A"

All staff should be given some choice about when they work\n答案解析：C选项在原文中完全找不到对应，B选项则错在reorganising和warning。而A选项failing to treat staff eaqually对应give certain staff preferential treatment，由此确定其为正确答案。\n第14题答案：C\n对应原文：they also noticed a significant increase in the amount each customer spent during their stay\n答案解析：抱怨的数量确实下降，但录音中说的是员工抱怨而非顾客，由此排除A。该酒店只是成立了员工忠诚计划，其成员人数是否增加完全没有提到，由此排除B。C选项rise对应increase，per对应each，其他基本为原词，由此确定其为正确答案。\n第15题答案：A\n对应原文：This situation has changed. Junior staff at all levels are regularly invited to meetings where their ideas are welcomed\n答案解析：Sun Club的做法是邀请初级员工经常参加各种会议，欢迎他们提建议。即营造出一种团队工作的氛围，由此确定A为正确答案。\n第16题答案：C\n对应原文：The hope is that organising training for individuals with management potential\n答案解析：The Portland的做法是为拥有管理潜力的员工组织培训。即为他们规划未来的职业发展，由此确定C为正确答案。\n第17题答案：B\n对应原文：As a reward, they’re sent on an all-expenses-paid trip abroad every year\n答案解析：Bluewater Hotels每年组织员工到国外公费旅行。即提供某种激励，由此确定B为正确答案。\n第18题答案：C\n对应原文：In order to encourage them to see that working in a hotel could be worthwhile and rewarding, with good prospects, they introduced a management programme\n答案解析：Pentlow Hotels的做法与Portland相似，都是引入某个管理项目，让员工看到未来的职业发展前景，由此确定C为正确答案。\n第19题答案：B\n对应原文：the hotel began issuing vouchers to help cover the cost of childcare\n答案解析：Green Planet提供优惠券，以此覆盖照顾孩子的费用。即金钱方面的好处，由此确定B为正确答案。\n第20题答案：A\n对应原文：by creating a co-operative and supportive environment.

Didn’t you want to be a professional athlete when you were at school?\nTHOMAS:\nYeah – that was my goal, and\nall my classmates assumed I would achieve it; they\nthought I was brilliant (Q21)\n.\nJEANNE:\nThat must have been a nice feeling.\nTHOMAS:\nMm, I thought I could win anything. There was no one who could run faster than me.\nJEANNE:\nExactly – so what happened? Did your mum and dad want you to be more ‘academic’?\nTHOMAS:\nNot at all. Perhaps they should have pushed me harder, though.\nJEANNE:\nWhat do you mean?\nTHOMAS:\nI think I should have practised more (Q22)\n.\nJEANNE:\nWhat makes you say that?\nTHOMAS:\nWell, I went out to Kenya for a couple of weeks to train …\nJEANNE:\nReally! I didn’t know that.\nTHOMAS:\nI was chosen to go there out of loads of kids and run with some of the top teenage athletes in the world. And … I was so calm about it.\nI just kept thinking how fortunate I was. What a great chance this was (Q23)\n! Everyone back home was so proud of me. But once we started competing, I very quickly realised I wasn’t good enough.\nJEANNE:\nThat must have been a huge shock.\nTHOMAS:\nI thought ‘this can’t be happening’ (Q24)\n! I was used to winning.\nJEANNE:\nI’m sorry to hear that.\nTHOMAS:\nIt’s OK. I’m over it now and I think it’s much better to do a university course and this one has such a variety of sports-related areas. It’s going to be good.\nJEANNE:\nOh, I agree – I chose it because of that.\nTHOMAS:\nSo Jeanne – have you thought of any ideas for the discussion session next week on technology and sport?\nJEANNE:\nWe have to cover more than one sport, don’t we?\nTHOMAS:\nYeah.\nJEANNE:\nYou know – we always think technology is about the future, but we could gather some ideas about past developments in sport.\nTHOMAS:\nLook at early types of equipment perhaps?\nUh, I remember reading something about table tennis bats once – how they ended up being covered with pimpled rubber.\nJEANNE:\nCos they were just wooden at first, I’d imagine.\nTHOMAS:\nYeah. In about the 1920s,\na factory was making rolls of the rubber in bulk for something like horse harnesses (Q25)\n.\nJEANNE:\nReally!\nTHOMAS:\nYeah – and someone realised that it’d make a perfect covering for the wooden bats.\nJEANNE:\nSo what about cricket – that’s had a few innovative changes. Maybe the pads they wear on their legs?\nTHOMAS:\nI don’t think they’ve changed much but, I’m just looking on the internet … and it says that when the first cricket helmet came in, in 1978,\nthe Australian batsman who first wore it was booed and jeered by people watching because it was so ugly (Q26)\n!\nJEANNE:\nWow, players have to protect themselves from getting hurt! I mean everyone wears one now.\nTHOMAS:\nMm, unlike the cycle helmet.\nJEANNE:\nWell, unless you’re a professional, but you’re right, many ordinary bikers don’t wear a helmet.\nTHOMAS:\nHey, look at these pictures of original helmet designs. This one looks like an upside-down bowl!\nJEANNE:\nYet, the woman’s laughing – she’s so proud to be wearing it!\nTHOMAS:\nIt says\nserious cyclists ended up with wet hair from all the hard exercise (Q27)\n.\nJEANNE:\nI guess that’s why they have large air vents in them now so that the skin can breathe more easily.\nTHOMAS:\nOK, so we’ve done helmets. What about golf balls or better still golf clubs – they’ve changed a lot.\nJEANNE:\nYeah – I remember my great grandfather telling me that\nbecause a club was made entirely of wood, it would easily break and players had to get another (Q28)\n.\nTHOMAS:\nThere’s no wood at all in them now, is there?\nJEANNE:\nNo – they’re much more powerful.\nTHOMAS:\nThe same must be true of hockey sticks.\nJEANNE:\nI don’t think so because players still use wooden sticks today. What it does say here, though, is that\nwhen the game started you had to produce a stick yourself (Q29)\n.\nTHOMAS:\nI guess they just weren’t being manufactured. So, one more perhaps. What about football?\nJEANNE:\nWell, I know the first balls were made of animal skin.\nTHOMAS:\nYeah, they covered them with pieces of leather that were stitched together, but … the balls let in water when it rained.\nJEANNE:\nOh, that would have made them much heavier.\nTHOMAS:\nThat’s right. You can imagine\nthe damage to players’ necks when the ball was headed (Q30)\n.\nJEANNE:\nHow painful that must have been!\nTHOMAS:\nYeah, well, I think we can put together some useful ideas …\n剑桥雅思17 Test4 Part3雅思听力答案\n21-22.

Today we’re going to look at another natural food product and that’s maple syrup. What is this exactly? Well, maple syrup looks rather like clear honey, but it’s not made by bees; it’s produced from the plant fluid – or sap – inside the maple tree and that makes maple syrup a very natural product. Maple syrup is a thick,\ngolden (Q31)\n, sweet-tasting liquid that can be bought in bottles or jars and poured onto food such as waffles and ice cream or used in the baking of cakes and pastries. It contains no preservatives or added ingredients, and it provides a\nhealthy (Q32)\nalternative to refined sugar.\nLet’s just talk a bit about the maple tree itself, which is where maple syrup comes from. So, there are many species of maple tree, and they’ll grow without fertilizer in areas where there’s plenty of moisture in the soil. However, they’ll only do this if another important criterion is fulfilled, which is that they must have full or partial sun exposure during the day and very cool nights – and I’ll talk more about that in a minute. There are only certain parts of the world that provide all these conditions: one is Canada, and by that, I mean all parts of Canada, and the other is the north-eastern states of North America. In these areas, the\nclimate (Q33)\nsuits the trees perfectly. In fact, Canada produces over two-thirds of the world’s maple syrup, which is why the five-pointed maple leaf is a Canadian symbol and has featured on the flag since 1964.\nSo how did maple syrup production begin? Well, long before Europeans settled in these parts of the world, the indigenous communities had started producing maple sugar. They bored holes in the trunks of maple trees and used containers made of tree bark to collect the liquid sap as it poured out. As they were unable to keep the liquid for any length of time – they didn’t have storage facilities in those days – they boiled the liquid by placing pieces of\nrock (Q34)\nthat had become scorching hot from the sun into the sap. They did this until it turned into sugar, and they were then able to use this to sweeten their food and drinks. Since that time, improvements have been made to the process, but it has changed very little overall.\nSo let’s look at the production of maple syrup today. Clearly, the maple forests are a valuable resource in many Canadian and North American communities. The trees have to be well looked after and they cannot be used to make syrup until the trunks reach a\ndiameter (Q35)\nof around 25 centimetres. This can take anything up to 40 years. As I’ve already mentioned, maple trees need the right conditions to grow and also to produce sap. Why is this? Well, what happens is that during a cold night, the tree absorbs water from the soil, and that rises through the tree’s vascular system. But then in the warmer daytime, the change in temperature causes the water to be pushed back down to the bottom of the tree. This continual movement – up and down – leads to the formation of the sap needed for maple syrup production.\nWhen the tree is ready, it can be tapped and this involves drilling a small hole into the trunk and inserting a\ntube (Q36)\ninto it that ends in a bucket. The trees can often take several taps, though the workers take care not to cause any damage to the healthy growth of the tree itself. The sap that comes out of the trees consists of 98 percent water and 2 percent sugar and other nutrients. It has to be boiled so that much of that water evaporates, and this process as to take place immediately, using what are called evaporators. These are basically extremely large pans – the sap is poured into these, a\nfire (Q37)\nis built and the pans are then heated until the sap boils. As it does this, the water evaporates, and the syrup begins to form. The evaporation process creates large quantities of\nsteam (Q38)\n, and the sap becomes thicker and denser, and, at just the right moment, when the sap is thick enough to be called maple syrup, the worker removes it from the heat. After this process, something called ‘sugar sand’ has to be filtered out as this builds up during the boiling and gives the syrup a\ncloudy (Q39)\nappearance and a slightly gritty taste. Once this has been done, the syrup is ready to be packaged so that it can be used for a whole variety of products. It takes 40\nlitres\nof sap to produce one\nlitre\n(Q40)\nof maple syrup so you can get an idea of how much is needed!\nSo that’s the basic process. In places like Quebec where …\n剑桥雅思17 Test4 Part4雅思听力答案\n31. golden\n32. healthy\n33. climate\n34. rock(s)\n35. diameter\n36. tube\n37. fire\n38. steam\n39. cloudy\n40. litre/liter"

Let me start by welcoming you all to this talk and thanking you for taking the time to consider joining ACE voluntary organization. ACE offers support to people and services in the local area and we’re now looking for more volunteers to help us do this.\nBy the way, I hope you’re all comfortable –\nwe have brought in extra seats so that no one has to stand, but it does mean that the people at the back of the room may be a bit squashed (Q11)\n. We’ll only be here for about half an hour so, hopefully, that’s OK.\nOne of the first questions we’re often asked is how old you need to be to volunteer. Well, you can be as young as 16 or you can be 60 or over; it all depends on what type of voluntary work you want to do.\nOther considerations, such as reliability, are crucial in voluntary work and age isn’t related to these, in our experience (Q12)\n.\nAnother question we get asked relates to training. Well, there’s plenty of that and it’s all face-to-face. What’s more,\ntraining doesn’t end when you start working for us -it takes place before, during and after periods of work (Q13)\n. Often, it’s run by other experienced volunteers as managers tend to prefer to get on with other things.\nNow, I would ask you to consider a couple of important issues before you decide to apply for voluntary work. We don’t worry about why you want to be a volunteer – people have many different reasons that range from getting work experience to just doing something they’ve always wanted to do.\nBut it is critical that you have enough hours in the day (Q14)\nfor whatever role we agree is suitable for you – if being a volunteer becomes stressful then it’s best not to do it at all. You may think that your income is important, but we don’t ask about that. It’s up to you to decide if you can work without earning money.\nWhat we value is dedication (Q15)\n. Some of our most loyal volunteers earn very little themselves but still give their full energy to the work they do with us.\nOK, so let’s take a look at some of the work areas that we need volunteers for and the sort of things that would help you in those.\nYou may wish simply to help us raise money.\nIf you have the creativity to come up with an imaginative or novel way of fundraising, we’d be delighted (Q16)\n, as standing in the local streets or shops with a collection box can be rather boring!\nOne outdoor activity that we need volunteers for is litter collection and for this\nit’s useful if you can walk for long periods, sometimes uphill (Q17)\n. Some of our regular collectors are quite elderly, but very active and keen to protect the environment.\nIf you enjoy working with children, we have three vacancies for what are called ‘playmates’These volunteers help children learn about staying healthy through a range of out-of-school activities. You don’t need to have children yourself, but\nit’s good if you know something about nutrition (Q18)\nand can give clear instructions.\nIf that doesn’t appeal to you, maybe you would be interested in\nhelping out at our story club for disabled children. especially if you have done some acting (Q19)\n. We put on three performances a year based on books they have read and we’re always looking for support with the theatrical side of this.\nThe last area I’ll mention today is first aid. Volunteers who join this group can end up teaching others in vulnerable groups who may be at risk of injury. Initially, though,\nyour priority will be to take in a lot of information and not forget any important steps or details (Q20)\n.\nRight, so does anyone have any questions …\n剑桥雅思18 Test1 Part2雅思听力答案\n11.

What did you think of the talk, then?\nCHANTAL:\nHi Hugo. I thought it was good once I’d moved seats.\nHUGO:\nOh – were the people beside you chatting or something?\nCHANTAL:\nIt wasn’t that. I went early so that I’d get a seat and not have to stand, but then this guy sat right in front of me and he was so tall!\nHUGO:\nIt’s hard to see through people’s heads, isn’t it (Q21)?\nCHANTAL:\nImpossible\n(Q21)\n!\nAnyway, to answer your question, I thought it was really interesting, especially what the speaker said about the job market.\nHUGO:\nMe too. I mean we know we’re going into a really competitive field so it’s obvious that we may struggle to get work.\nCHANTAL:\nThat’s right – and we know we can’t all have that ‘dream job’.\nHUGO:\nYeah, but it looks like\nthere’s a whole range of … areas of work that we hadn’t even thought of (Q22)\n– like fashion journalism, for instance.\nCHANTAL:\nYeah – I wasn’t expecting so many career options.\nHUGO:\nMmm. Overall, she had quite a strong message, didn’t she?\nCHANTAL:\nShe did. She kept saying things like ‘I know you all think this, but .’and then she’d tell us how it really is.\nHUGO:\nPerhaps she thinks students are a bit narrow-minded about the industry.\nCHANTAL:\nIt was a bit harsh, though! We know it’s a tough industry (Q23).\nHUGO:\nYeah – and we’re only first years, after all. We’ve got a lot to learn (Q23).\nCHANTAL:\nExactly. Do you think our secondary-school education should have been more career-focused?\nHUGO:\nWell, we had numerous talks on careers, which was good, but\nnone of them were very inspiring. They could have asked more people like today’s speaker to talk to us (Q24).\nCHANTAL:\nI agree. We were told about lots of different careers – just when we needed to be, but not by the experts who really know stuff.\nHUGO:\nSo did today’s talk influence your thoughts on what career you’d like to take up in the future?\nCHANTAL:\nWell. I promised myself that I’d go through this course and keep an open mind till the end.\nHUGO:\nBut I think it’s better to pick an area of the industry now and then aim to get better and better at it.\nCHANTAL:\nWell, I think we’ll just have to differ on that issue (Q25)!\nHUGO:\nOne thing’s for certain, though. From what she said, we’ll be unpaid assistants in the industry for quite a long time.\nCHANTAL:\nMmm.\nHUGO:\nI’m prepared for that (Q26)\n, aren’t you?\nCHANTAL:\nActually, I’m not going to accept that view.\nHUGO:\nReally? But she knows it’s the case – and everyone else says the same.\nCHANTAL:\nThat doesn’t mean it has to be true for me.\nHUGO:\nOK. Well – I hope you’re right!\nCHANTAL:\nI thought the speaker’s account of her first job was fascinating.\nHUGO:\nYeah – she admitted she was lucky to get work being a personal dresser for a musician. She didn’t even apply for the job and there she was getting paid to choose all his clothes.\nCHANTAL:\nIt must have felt amazing – though she said all she was looking for back then was experience, not financial reward.\nHUGO:\nMmm. And then he was so mean, telling her\nshe was more interested in her own appearance than his (Q27)\n!\nCHANTAL:\nBut – she did realise he was right about that, which really made me think. I am always considering my own clothes but now I can see you should be focusing on your client!\nHUGO:\nShe obviously regretted losing the job.\nCHANTAL:\nWell, as she said,\nshe should have hidden her negative feelings about him. but she didn’t (Q28)\n.\nHUGO:\nIt was really brave the way she picked herself up and took that job in retail. Fancy working in a shop after that!\nCHANTAL:\nYeah – well, she recommended we all do it at some point. I guess as a designer you’d get to find out some useful information, like how big or small the average shopper is.\nHUGO:\nI think that’s an issue for manufacturers, not designers. However, it would be useful to know if there’s a gap in the market – you know,\nan item that no one’s stocking but that consumers are looking for (Q29)\n.\nCHANTAL:\nYeah, people don’t give up searching.\nThey also take things back to the store if they aren’t right (Q30)\n.\nHUGO:\nYeah. Imagine you worked in an expensive shop and you found out the garments sold there were being returned because they … fell apart in the wash!\nCHANTAL:\nYeah, it would be good to know that kind of thing.\nHUGO:\nYeah.\n剑桥雅思18 Test1 Part3雅思听力答案\n21.

We know it’s a tough industry.\nHUGO: Yeah – and we’re only first years, after all. We’ve got a lot to learn.\n答案解析：这道题需要稍微理解一下。Chantal表示演讲者的话有些刺耳。他们都知道时尚产业是个竞争十分激烈的行业。而Hugo也补充道，他们才一年级，后面还会学很多东西。可见他们两个都觉得演讲者过于苛刻了。选项中只有A的含义最为接近，因此确定其为正确答案。\n第24题答案：C\n对应原文：none of them were very inspiring. This article is from laokaoya website. They could have asked more people like today’s speaker to talk to us\n答案解析：Hugo和Chantal对学校就业办公室所举办的讲座数量和介绍的各种职业发展方向都比较满意。但觉得他们应该邀请更多像今天演讲者这样的人来举办讲座。即他们不满的主要是主讲人的问题，因此确定C为正确答案。选项A和B都无法对应题干中的criticise。\n第25题答案：B\n对应原文：Well, I think we’ll just have to differ on that issue\n答案解析：这道题的关键在于题干中的disagree。录音中Chantal觉得应该到最后再决定自己的未来，而Hugo则觉得现在选定方向更好。即他们在何时做决定方面无法达成一致，因此确定B为正确答案。选项A和C在原文中都找不到对应。\n第26题答案：A\n对应原文：Hugo: I’m prepared for that\n答案解析：这道题中，Hugo和Chantal的意见再次出现了不一致，但因为题干只问Hugo的看法，因此我们直接选A就好。\n第27题答案：B\n对应原文：she was more interested in her own appearance than his\n答案解析：这道题并没有设置过多的干扰项，只要大家能将选项和录音联系起来就好。B选项中paying too much attention对应more interested，how she looked对应her own appearance，由此确定其为正确答案。\n第28题答案：E\n对应原文：she should have hidden her negative feelings about him. but she didn’t\n答案解析：这道题考察虚拟语气。演讲者认为他应该隐藏对雇主的负面看法，但并没有这么做。选项E中openly对应should have hidden，disliking对应negative feelings，由此确定其为正确答案。\n第29题答案：C\n对应原文：an item that no one’s stocking but that consumers are looking for\n答案解析：相比于上一道多选而言，这道题设置了一些干扰项。录音首先提到E选项（fashion size对应how big or small the average shopper is），但Hugo表示了否定。而C选项中的want对应are looking for, fashion design对应an item， can’t find对应no one’s stocking，再加上后面Chantal说了Yeah，因此确定其为正确答案。\n第30题答案：A\n对应原文：They also take things back to the store if they aren’t right\n答案解析：选项A中return对应take bake, reasons则对应后面举例的内容，因此确定其为正确答案。选项B和选项D则在录音中找不到对应，因此统统排除。"

This is known as translocation and has been carried out in Malawi in Africa in recent years. The reason this is being done is because of overpopulation of elephants in some areas.\nOverpopulation is a good problem to have and not one we tend to hear about very often. In Malawi’s Majete National Park the elephant population had been wiped out by poachers, who killed the elephants for their ivory. But in 2003, the park was restocked and effective law enforcement was introduced. Since then, not a single elephant has been poached. In this safe environment, the elephant population boomed. Breeding went so well that there were more elephants than the park could support.\nThis led to a number of problems. Firstly, there was more competition for food, which meant that some elephants were suffering from hunger. As there was a limit to the amount of food in the national park, some elephants began looking further afield. Elephants were routinely knocking down\nfences (Q31)\naround the park, which then had to be repaired at a significant cost.\nTo solve this problem, the decision was made to move dozens of elephants from MajeteNational Park to Nkhotakota Wildlife Park, where there were no elephants. But, obviously, attempting to move significant numbers of elephants to a new home 300 kilometres away is quite a challenge.\nSo how did this translocation process work in practice?\nElephants were moved in groups of between eight and twenty. all belonging to one\nfamily (Q32)\n. Because relationships are very important to elephants, they all had to be moved at the same time. A team of vets and park rangers flew over the park in\nhelicopters (Q33)\nand targeted a group, which were rounded up and directed to a designated open plain.\nThe vets then used darts to immobilise the elephants – this was a tricky manoeuvre, as they not only had to select the right dose of tranquiliser for different-sized elephants but they had to dart the elephants as they were running around. This also had to be done as quickly as possible so as to minimise the\nstress (Q34)\ncaused. As soon as the elephants began to flop onto the ground, the team moved in to take care of them.\nTo avoid the risk of suffocation, the team had to make sure none of the elephants were lying on their chests because their lungs could be crushed in this position. So all the elephants had to be placed on their\nsides (Q35)\n. One person stayed with each elephant while they waited for the vets to do checks. It was very important to keep an eye on their\nbreathing (Q36)\n– if there were fewer than six breaths per minute, the elephant would need urgent medical attention. Collars were fitted to the matriarch in each group so their movements could be tracked in their new home. Measurements were taken of each elephant’s tusks – elephants with large tusks would be at greater risk from poachers -and also of their\nfeet (Q37)\n. The elephants were then taken to a recovery area before being loaded onto trucks and transported to their new home.\nThe elephants translocated to Nkhotakota settled in very well and the project has generally been accepted to have been a huge success -and not just for the elephants.\nEmployment (Q38)\nprospects have improved enormously, contributing to rising living standards for the whole community. Poaching is no longer an issue, as former poachers are able to find more reliable sources of income. In fact, many of them volunteered to give up their\nweapons (Q39)\n, as they were no longer of any use to them.\nMore than two dozen elephants have been born at Nkhotakota since relocation. With an area of more than 1,800 square kilometres, there’s plenty of space for the elephant population to continue to grow. Their presence is also helping to rebalance Nkhotakota’s damaged ecosystem and providing a sustainable conservation model, which could be replicated in other parks. All this has been a big draw for\ntourism (Q40)\n, which contributes five times more than the illegal wildlife trade to GDP, and this is mainly because of the elephants. There’s also been a dramatic rise in interest …\n剑桥雅思18 Test1 Part4雅思听力答案\n31. fences\n32. family\n33. helicopters\n34. stress\n35. sides\n36. breathing\n37. feet\n38. employment\n39. weapons\n40. tourism"

Elephants were routinely knocking down\nfences\naround the park\n答案解析：这道题的难点有三个。其一，答案所在位置距听力音频开头太远，很容易跑神；其二，题目并没有什么特别明显的提示词，需要大家从听到hunger开始就集中注意力；第三，damage和knocking down的对应有些不太好识别，比较考验大家的词汇量。\n第32题答案：family\n对应原文：Elephants were moved in groups of between eight and twenty, all belonging to one\nfamily\n答案解析：听到translocation process和groups意识到答案即将到来，空前词same与one同义替换，根据修饰关系，确定答案为family。\n第33题答案：helicopters\n对应原文：A team of vets and park rangers flew over the park in\nhelicopters\nand targeted a group\n答案解析：听到vets意识到答案即将到来。虽然空前短语made use of在原文中没有明显的替换，但从题干可以推测出空上应该填某种工具，由此锁定helicopters。\n第34题答案：stress\n对应原文：This also had to be done as quickly as possible so as to minimise the\nstress\ncaused.\n答案解析：quickly提示大家答案即将到来，空前词reduce与minimise同义替换，根据修饰关系确定stress为正确答案。\n第35题答案：sides\n对应原文：So all the elephants had to be placed on their\nsides\n答案解析：这道题比较容易将前面的chests当成答案。但题目问的是大象应该躺在他们的什么上，而chests稍微靠前的位置则有none这一否定，因此排除之后再往后找。发现be placed on与be turned on同义替换，由此确定答案为sides。\n第36题答案：breathing\n对应原文：It was very important to keep an eye on their\nbreathing\n答案解析：这道题采用语序颠倒的手法，将原本位于空后的be monitored替换成keep an eye之后放在答案前面。不过题干中的被动有一定的提示作用，不算太过突然。\n第37题答案：feet\n对应原文：Measurements were taken of each elephant’s tusks – elephants with large tusks would be at greater risk from poachers – and also of their\nfeet\n答案解析：考察并列关系。录音并没有做太多的手脚。听到tusks之后注意并列提示词就好。\n第38题答案：employment\n对应原文：\nEmployment\nprospects have improved enormously, this article is from laokaoya website, contributing to rising living standards for the whole community\n答案解析：这道题比较难。题干几乎没有任何提示词，只能根据advantages这一小标题来搜寻具有相应含义的答案。\n第39题答案：weapons\n对应原文：Poaching is no longer an issue, as former poachers are able to find more reliable sources of income. In fact, many of them volunteered to give up their\nweapons\n答案解析：这道题的难点主要在于give up和reduction的替换不太好识别，而且录音中poachers和weapons并非并列关系，只能根据词性和句义去筛选答案，比较考验大家的基本功。\n第40题答案：tourism\n对应原文：All this has been a big draw for\ntourism\n, which contributes five times more than the illegal wildlife trade to GDP.\n答案解析：听到conservation model（对应题干中上一行的example of conservation）意识到答案即将到来。哪怕大家没有识别出increase与big draw的同义替换，根据句义，这一块能填上去的名词也只有tourism一个。"

I’ve got a bit of experience and I can provide references.\nWOMAN:\nThat’s good. I can check all that later. Now, Milo’s Restaurants have some vacancies at the moment. They’re a really good company to work for. Lots of benefits.\nMAN:\nOh right.\nWOMAN:\nYes. They’ve got a very good reputation for looking after staff. For example, all employees get\ntraining (Q1)\n– even temporary staff.\nMAN:\nOh really? That’s quite unusual, isn’t it?\nWOMAN:\nCertainly is.\nMAN:\nAnd do staff get free uniforms too?\nWOMAN:\nUm … you just need to wear a white T-shirt and black trousers, it says here. So I guess not … But another benefit of working for a big company like this is that you can get a\ndiscount (Q2)\nat any of their restaurants.\nMAN:\nEven at weekends?\nWOMAN:\nNo, but you’ll be working then anyway.\nMAN:\nOh yes. I suppose so. Most of their restaurants are in the city centre, aren’t they? So, easy to get to by bus?\nWOMAN:\nYes. That’s right. But if you have to do a late shift and finish work after midnight, the company will pay for you to get a\ntaxi (Q3)\nhome.\nMAN:\nI probably won’t need one. I think I’d use my bike.\nWOMAN:\nNow, they do have some quite specific requirements for the kind of person they’re looking for. Milo’s is a young, dynamic company and they’re really keen on creating a strong team. It’s really important that you can fit in and get on well with everyone.\nMAN:\nYeah. I’ve got no problem with that. It sounds good, actually. The last place I worked for was quite demanding too. We had to make sure we gave a really high level of\nservice (Q4)\n.\nWOMAN:\nThat’s good to hear because that will be equally important at Milo’s. I know they want people who have an eye for detail.\nMAN:\nThat’s fine.I’m very used to working in that kind of environment.\nWOMAN:\nPerfect. So the only other thing that’s required is good communication skills, so you’ll need to have a certificate in\nEnglish (Q5)\n.\nMAN:\nSure.\nWOMAN:\nLet’s have a look at the current job vacancies at Milo’s. The first one is in\nWivenhoe (Q6)\nStreet.\nMAN:\nSorry, where?\nWOMAN:\nWivenhoe. W-I-V-E-N-H-O-E. It’s quite central, just off Cork Street.\nMAN:\nOh right.\nWOMAN:\nThey’re looking for a breakfast supervisor.\nMAN:\nThat would be OK.\nWOMAN:\nSo you’re probably familiar with the kind of responsibilities involved. Obviously checking that all the portions are correct, etc., and then things like checking all the procedures for cleaning the\nequipment (Q7)\nare being followed.\nMAN:\nOK. And what about the salary? In my last job I was getting 9.50 pounds per hour. I was hoping to get a bit more than that.\nWOMAN:\nWell, to begin with you’d be getting\n9.75 (Q8)\npounds but that goes up to 11.25 pounds after three months.\nMAN:\nThat’s not too bad. And I suppose it’s a very early start?\nWOMAN:\nMmm. That’s the only unattractive thing about this job. But then you have the afternoons and evenings free. So the restaurant starts serving breakfast from 7 a.m.And you’d have to be there at 5.30 to set everything up. But you’d be finished at 12.30.\nMAN:\nMmm.Well, as you say, there are advantages to that.\nWOMAN:\nNow, you might also be interested in the job at the City Road branch. That’s for a junior chef, so again a position of responsibility.\nMAN:\nI might prefer that, actually.\nWOMAN:\nRight, well obviously this role would involve supporting the sous chef and other senior staff. And you’d be responsible for making sure there’s enough stock each week – and sorting out all the\ndeliveries (Q9)\n.\nMAN:\nI’ve never done that before, but l imagine it’s fairly straightforward, once you get the hang of it.\nWOMAN:\nYes, and you’d be working alongside more experienced staff to begin with, so I’m sure it wouldn’t be a problem. The salary’s slightly higher here. It’s an annual salary of E23,000.\nMAN:\nRight.\nWOMAN:\nI know that if they like you, it’s likely you’ll be promoted quite quickly. So that’s worth thinking about.\nMAN:\nYes. It does sound interesting. What are the hours like?\nWOMAN:\nThe usual, I think. There’s a lot of evening and weekend work, but they’re closed on Mondays. But you do get one\nSunday (Q10)\noff every four weeks. So would you like me to send off your …\n剑桥雅思18 Test2 Part1雅思听力答案\n1. training\n2. discount\n3. taxi\n4. service\n5. English\n6.

But because of the new industrial centre in Nunston,\nthere’s a lot of demand for housing for employees in\nthe region. as many employees are having to commute long distances at present (Q11)\n. Of course, there’s also the fact that we have an international airport just 20 minutes’ drive away, but although that’s certainly convenient, it wasn’t one of our major criteria for choosing the site. We were more interested in the fact that\nthere’s an excellent hospital just 15 kilometres away and a large secondary school even closer than that (Q12)\n. One drawback to the site is that it’s on quite a steep slope, but we’ve taken account of that in our planning so it shouldn’t be a major problem.\nWe’ve had a lot of positive feedback about the plans. People like the wide variety of accommodation types and prices, and the fact that it’s only a short drive to get out into the countryside from the development. We were particularly pleased that so many people liked the designs for the layout of the development, with the majority of people saying it generally made a good impression and\nblended in well with the natural features of the landscape, with provision made for protecting trees and wildlife on the site (Q13)\n. Some people have mentioned that they’d like to see more facilities for cyclists, and we’ll look at that, but the overall feedback has been that\nthe design and facilities of the development make it seem a place where people of all ages can live together happily (Q14)\n.\nOK. So I’ll put a map of the proposed development up on the screen. You’ll see it’s bounded on the south side by the main road, which then goes on to Nunston. Another boundary is formed by London Road, on the western side of the development. Inside the development there’ll be about 400 houses and 3 apartment blocks.\nThere’ll also be a school for children up to 11 years old. If you look at the South Entrance at the bottom of the map, there’s\na road from there that goes right up through the development. The school will be on that road, at the corner of the second turning to the left (Q15)\n.\nA large sports centre is planned with facilities for indoor and outdoor activities. This will be\non the western side of the development, just below the road that branches off from London Road (Q16)\n.\nThere’ll be a clinic where residents can go if they have any health problems. Can you see the lake towards the top of the map?\nThe clinic will be just below this, to the right of a street of houses (Q17)\n.\nThere’ll also be a community centre for people of all ages.\nOn the northeast side of the development, there’ll be a row of specially designed houses specifically for residents over 65 and the community centre will be adjoining this (Q18)\n.\nWe haven’t forgotten about shopping. There’ll be\na supermarket between the two entrances to the development. We’re planning to leave the three large trees near London Road, and it’ll be just to the south of these (Q19)\n.\nIt’s planned to have a playground for younger children. If you look at\nthe road that goes up from the South Entrance, you’ll see it curves round to the left at the top and the playground will be in that curve, with nice views of the lake (Q20)\n.\nOK, so now does anyone …\n剑桥雅思18 Test2 Part2雅思听力答案\n11-12.

We haven’t got that much time left.\nMICHELLE:\nNo, Adam. But at least we’ve done all the background reading. I found it really interesting – I’d never even heard of the Laki eruption before this.\nADAM:\nMe neither. I suppose 1783 is a long time ago.\nMICHELLE:\nBut it was a huge eruption and it had such devastating consequences.\nADAM:\nI know. It was great there were so many primary sources to look at. It really gives you a sense of how catastrophic the volcano was. People were really trying to make sense of the science for the first time.\nMICHELLE:\nThat’s right. But\nwhat I found more significant was how it impacted directly and\nindirectly on political events, as well as having massive social and economic consequences (Q21)\n.\nADAM:\nI know. That should be the main focus of our presentation.\nMICHELLE:\nThe observations made by people at the time were interesting, weren’t they? I mean, they all gave a pretty consistent account of what happened, even if they didn’t always use the same terminology.\nADAM:\nYeah.\nI was surprised there were so many weather stations established by that time (Q22)\n– so, you know, you can see how the weather changed, often by the hour.\nMICHELLE:\nRight. Writers at the time talked about the Laki haze to describe the volcanic fog that spread across Europe. They all realized that this wasn’t the sort of fog they were used to – and of course this was in pre-industrial times – so they hadn’t experienced sulphur-smelling fog before.\nADAM:\nNo, that’s true.\nMICHELLE:\nReports from the period\nblamed the haze for an increase in headaches, respiratory issues and asthma attacks (Q23)\n. And they all describe how it covered the sun and made it look a strange red colour.\nADAM:\nMust have been very weird.\nMICHELLE:\nIt’s interesting that Benjamin Franklin wrote about the haze. Did you read that? He was the American ambassador in Paris at the time.\nADAM:\nYeah. At first no one realised that the haze was caused by the volcanic eruption in Iceland.\nMICHELLE:\nIt was Benjamin Franklin who realised that before anyone else (Q24).\nADAM:\nHe’s often credited with that, apparently. But a French naturalist beat him to it (Q24)\n– I can’t remember his name. I’d have to look it up. Then other naturalists had the same idea – all independently of each other.\nMICHELLE:\nOh right. We should talk about the immediate impact of the eruption, which was obviously enormous – especially in Iceland,  where so many people died.\nADAM:\nMmm. You’d expect that –  and the fact that the volcanic ash drifted so swiftly –\nbut not that the effects would go on for so long (Q25)\n. Or that two years after the eruption,\nstrange weather events were being reported as far away as North America and North Africa (Q26)\n.\nMICHELLE:\nNo. I found all that hard to believe too. It must have been terrible – and there was nothing anyone could do about it, even if they knew the ash cloud was coming in their direction.\nMICHELLE:\nWe should run through some of the terrible consequences of the eruption experienced in different countries. There’s quite a varied range.\nADAM:\nStarting with Iceland, where the impact on farming was devastating.\nMICHELLE:\nMmm. One of the most dramatic things there was the effect on\nlivestock as they grazed in the fields. They were poisoned (Q27)\nbecause they ate vegetation that had been contaminated with fluorine as a result of the volcanic fallout.\nADAM:\nThat was horrible. In Egypt, the bizarre weather patterns led to a severe drought and as a result the Nile didn’t flood, which meant the crops all failed.\nMICHELLE:\nIt’s so far from where the eruption happened and yet\nthe famine there led to more people dying than any other country (Q28)\n. It was worse than the plague.\nADAM:\nThen in the UK the\nmortality rate\nwent up a lot- presumably from respiratory illnesses. According to one report\nit was about double the usual number and included an unusually high percentage of people under the age of 25 (Q29\n).\nMICHELLE:\nMmm. I think people will be surprised to hear that the weather in the USA was badly affected too. George Washington even makes a note in his diary that they were snowbound until March in Virginia. That was before he became president.\nADAM:\nYes, and\nthere was ice floating down the Mississippi, which was unprecedented (Q30)\n.\nMICHELLE:\nAstonishing, really. Anyway, what do you think …\n剑桥雅思18 Test2 Part3雅思听力答案\n21. C\n22. A\n23. B\n24. B\n25-26. AB\n27. D\n28. A\n29. C\n30. F"

Now, we’ve been asked to choose an aspect of European clothing or fashion and to talk about its development over time.\nI decided to focus on a rather small area of clothing and that’s pockets. I chose pockets for two reasons, really. We all have them-in jeans, jackets, coats, for example – and even though we often carry bags or briefcases as well, nothing is quite as\nconvenient (Q31)\nas being able to pop your phone or credit card into your pocket. Yet, I suspect that, other than that, people don’t really think about pockets too much and they’re rather overlooked as a fashion item.\nIt’s certainly very interesting to go back in time and see how pockets developed for men and women. In the 18th century, fashions were quite different from the way they are now, and pockets were too. If we think about male fashion first … that was the time when\nsuits (Q32)\nbecame popular. Trousers were knee-length only and referred to as ‘breeches’, the waistcoats were short and the jackets were long, but all three garments were lined with material and pockets were sewn into this cloth by whichever\ntailor (Q33)\nthe customer used. The wearer could then carry small objects such as pencils or coins on their person and reach them through a gap in the lining. Coat pockets became increasingly decorative on the outside for men who wanted to look stylish, but they were often larger but plainer if the wearer was someone with a\nprofession (Q34)\nwho needed to carry medical instruments – a doctor or physician, for example.\nThe development of women’s pockets was a little different. For one thing, they weren’t nearly as\nvisible (Q35)\nor as easy to reach as men’s. In the 18th and 19th centuries, women carried numerous possessions on their person and some of these could be worth a lot of money. Women were more vulnerable to theft and wealthy women, in particular, worried constantly about pickpockets. So – what they did was to have a pair of pockets made that were tied together with\nstring (Q36)\n. The pockets were made of fabric, which might be recycled cloth if the wearer had little money or something more expensive, such as linen, sometimes featuring very delicate embroidery. Women tied the pockets around their\nwaist (Q37)\nso that they hung beneath their clothes. Remember, skirts were long then and there was plenty of room to hide a whole range of small possessions between the layers of petticoats that were commonly worn. They would have an opening in the folds of their skirts through which they could reach whatever they needed, like their\nperfume (Q38)\n. Working women, of course, also needed to carry around items that they might use for whatever job or trade they were involved in, but their pairs of pockets still remained on the inside of their clothing, they just got bigger or longer sometimes reaching down to their knees!\nSo the tie-on pockets went well into the 19th century and only changed when fashion altered towards the end of that period. That’s when dresses became tighter and less bulky, and the pairs of pockets became very noticeable – they stood out too much and detracted from the woman’s\nimage (Q39)\n. Women who had been used to carrying around a range of personal possessions – and still wanted to-needed somewhere to carry these items about their person. That was when small bags, or pouches as they were known, came into fashion and, of course, they inevitably led on to the\nhandbag (Q40)\nof more modern times, particularly when fashion removed pockets altogether.\n剑桥雅思18 Test2 Part4雅思听力答案\n31. convenient\n32. suits\n33. tailor\n34. profession\n35. visible\n36. string(s)\n37. waist(s)\n38. perfume\n39. image\n40. handbag"

We have an application form – would you like to complete it over the phone, then you can ask any questions you might have?\nDAN:\nOh, yes, thanks.\nBREDA:\nOK, so what’s your family name? It’s Green-Dan Green.\nDAN:\nSo – can I take your email address? Yes, it’s dan1068@market.com.\nBREDA:\nThanks. And what about your home address?\nDAN:\nWell, I’m about ten miles away from your club in Peacetown. I live in a house there.\nBREDA:\nOK, so what’s the house number and street?\nDAN:\nIt’s 52\nMarrowfield (Q1)\nStreet.\nBREDA:\nIs that M-A double R-O-W-F-I-E-L-D?\nDAN:\nThat’s right.\nBREDA:\n.. and that’s Peacetown, you said?\nDAN:\nUhuh.\nBREDA:\nSo how did you hear about our club? Did you look on the internet?\nDAN:\nI usually do that, but this time, well, I was talking to a\nrelative (Q2)\nthe other day and he suggested it.\nBREDA:\nOh, is he a member too?\nDAN:\nHe belongs to another club – but he’d heard good things about yours.\nBREDA:\nOK. So what do you hope to get from joining?\nDAN:\nWell, one thing that really interests me is the competitions that you have. I enjoy entering those.\nBREDA:\nRight. Anything else?\nDAN:\nWell, I also like to\nsocialise (Q3)\nwith other photographers. That’s great. So what type of membership would you like? What are the options?\nBREDA:\nIt’s 30 pounds a year for\nfull (Q4)\nmembership or 20 pounds a year if you’re an associate.\nDAN:\nI think I’ll go for the full membership, then.\nBREDA:\nThat’s a good idea because you can’t vote in meetings with an associate membership.\nBREDA:\nIf I could just find out a bit more about you…\nDAN:\nOK.\nBREDA:\nSo you said you wanted to compete – have you ever won any photography competitions?\nDAN:\nNot yet, but I have entered three in the past.\nBREDA:\nOh, that’s interesting. So why don’t you tell me something about those? Let’s start with the first one.\nDAN:\nWell, the theme was entitled ‘\nDomestic (Q5)\nLife’.\nBREDA:\nI see – so it had to be something related to the home?\nDAN:\nYeah. I chose to take a photo of a family sitting round the dinner table having a meal,  and, um, I didn’t win, but I did get some feedback.\nBREDA:\nOh, what did the judges say?\nDAN:\nThat it was too ‘busy’ as a picture.\nBREDA:\nAha- so it was the composition of the picture that they criticised?\nDAN:\nThat’s right – and once they’d told me that, I could see my mistake.\nBREDA:\nSo what was the theme of the second competition?\nDAN:\nWell, my university was on the coast and that area gets a lot of beautiful sunsets, so that was the theme.\nBREDA:\nOh, sunsets, that’s a great theme.\nDAN:\nYes. The instructions were to capture the\nclouds (Q6)\nas well – it couldn’t just be blue sky and a setting sun.\nBREDA:\nSure, cause they give you all those amazing pinks and purples.\nDAN:\nYeah – and I thought I’d done that well, but the feedback was that I should have waited a bit longer to get the shot.\nBREDA:\nI see.

He’s going to tell us everything we need to know about picking wild mushrooms. Thank you very much. Well, I need to start by talking about safety. You really\nDAN:\nThank you very much. Well, I need to start by talking about safety. You really need to know what you’re doing because some mushrooms are extremely poisonous. Having said that, once you know what to look for, it’s really worth doing for the amazing variety of mushrooms available – which you can’t get in the shops. But of course, you have to be very careful and that’s why l always say\nyou should never consume mushrooms picked by friends or neighbours (Q11)\n– always remember that some poisonous mushrooms look very similar to edible ones and it’s easy for people to get confused.\nThe other thing to avoid is mushrooms\ngrowing beside busy roads (Q12)\nfor obvious reasons. But nothing beats the taste of freshly picked mushrooms – don’t forget that the ones in the shops are often several days old and past their best.\nThere are certain ideas about wild mushrooms that it’s important to be aware. Don’t listen to people who tell you that it’s only OK to eat mushrooms that are pale or dull- this is completely untrue.\nSome edible mushrooms are bright red (Q13)\n, for example. Personally, I prefer mushrooms cooked but it won’t do you any harm to eat them uncooked in salads – it’s not necessary to peel them. Another thing you should remember is that you can’t tell if a mushroom is safe to eat by its smell – some of the most deadly mushrooms have no smell and taste quite nice, apparently.\nFinally, just because deer or squirrels eat a particular mushroom\ndoesn’t mean that you can (Q14)\n.\nOf course, mushroom picking is associated with the countryside but if you haven’t got a car, your local park can be a great place to start. There are usually a range of habitats where mushrooms grow, such as playing fields and wooded areas.\nBut you need to be there first thing in the morning (Q15)\n, as there’s likely be a lot of competition – not just from people but wildlife too. The deer often get the best mushrooms in my local park.\nIf you’re a complete beginner, I wouldn’t recommend going alone or relying on photos in a book, even the one I’ve written! There are some really good phone apps for identifying mushrooms, but you can’t always rely on getting a good signal in the middle of a wood.\nIf possible, you should go with a group led by an expert (Q16)\n– you’ll stay safe and learn a lot that way.\nConservation is a really important consideration and you must follow a few basic rules.\nYou should never pick all the mushrooms in one area – collect only enough for your own needs (Q17)\n. Be very careful that you don’t trample on young mushrooms or other plants. And make sure you don’t pick any mushrooms that are endangered and protected by law.\nThere’s been a decline in some varieties of wild mushrooms in this part of the country. Restaurants are becoming more interested in locally sourced food like wild mushrooms,\nbut the biggest problem is that so many new houses have been built in this area in the last ten years (Q18)\n. And more water is being taken from rivers and reservoirs because of this, and mushroom habitats have been destroyed.\nAnyway, a word of advice on storing mushrooms.\nCollect them in a brown paper bag and as soon as you get home, put them in the fridge. They’ll be fine for a couple of days\n, but it’s best to cook them as soon as possible – after washing them really carefully first, of course.\nSo everybody knows what a mushroom tastes like, right? Well, you’ll be surprised by the huge variety of wild mushrooms there are. Be adventurous!\nThey’re great\nin so many dishes – stir fries, risottos, pasta (Q19)\n. But just be aware that some people can react badly to certain varieties so it’s a good idea not to eat huge quantities to begin with.\nOK, so now I’m going to show you …\n剑桥雅思18 Test3 Part2雅思听力答案\n11-12.

Looking at the first industrial revolution in Britain in the 19th century and seeing how people reacted to massive change was a real eye-opener.\nYong Woman:\nYes. It was interesting to hear how people felt about automation then and what challenges they faced. I didn’t know that first started with workers in the textile industry.\nYong Man:\nWith those protesting workers called the Luddites destroying their knitting machines because they were so worried about losing their jobs.\nYong Woman:\nYes, and\nultimately, they didn’t achieve anything (Q21)\n. And anyway, industrialization created more jobs than it destroyed.\nYong Man:\nYes, that’s true – but it probably didn’t seem a positive thing at the time.\nI can see why the Luddites felt so threatened (Q22).\nYong Woman:\nI know. I’m sure I would have felt the same. The discussion about the future of work was really optimistic for a change. I like the idea that work won’t involve doing boring, repetitive tasks, as robots will do all that. Normally, you only hear negative stuff about the future.\nYong Man:\nBit too optimistic, don’t you think? For example, I can’t see how people are about to have more leisure time, when\nall the evidence shows people are spending longer than ever at work (Q23)\n.\nYong Woman:\nNo – that’s true. And\nwhat about lower unemployment? I’m not so sure about that (Q24)\n.\nYong Man:\nPerhaps in the long term – but not in the foreseeable future.\nYong Woman:\nMmm. And I expect most people will be expected to work until they’re much older – as everyone’s living much longer.\nYong Man:\nThat’s already happening.\nYong Woman:\nI enjoyed all that stuff on how technology has changed some jobs and how they’re likely to change in the near future.\nYong Man:\nYeah, incredible. Like accountants. You might think all the technological innovations would have put them out of a job,\nbut in fact there are more of them than ever. They’re still really in demand and have become far more efficient (Q25)\n.\nYong Woman:\nRight. That was amazing. Twenty times more accountants in this country compared to the 19th century.\nYong Man:\nI know. I’d never have thought that demand for hairdressing would have gone up so much in the last hundred years. One hairdresser for every 287 people now, compared to one for over 1,500.\nYong Woman:\nYeah\nbecause people’s earning power has gone up so they can afford to spend more on personal services like that (Q26)\n.\nYong Man:\nBut technology hasn’t changed the actual job that much.\nYong Woman:\nNo, they’ve got hairdryers, etc. but it’s one job where you don’t depend on a computer … The kind of work that administrative staff do has changed enormously, thanks to technology. Even 20 years ago there were secretaries doing dictation and typing.\nYong Man:\nYes.\nReally boring compared to these days when they’re given much more responsibility and higher status (Q27)\n.\nYong Woman:\nMmm. A lot of graduates go in for this kind of work now … I’d expected there to be a much bigger change in the number of agricultural workers in the 19th century. But the 1871 census showed that roughly 25% of the population worked on the land.\nYong Man:\nYeah,\nI’d have assumed it would be more than 50%. Now it’s less than 0.2% (Q28)\n.\nYong Woman:\nWhat about care workers?\nYong Man:\nThey barely existed in the 19th century as people’s lifespan was so much shorter.\nBut now of course this sector will see huge growth (Q29)\n.\nYong Woman:\nYeah – and it’s hard enough to meet current demand. The future looks quite bleak for bank clerks. They’ve been in decline since ATMs were introduced in the eighties.\nYong Man:\nAnd\ntechnology will certainly make most of the jobs they do now redundant, I think (Q30)\n.\nYong Woman:\nI agree, although the situation may change. It’s very hard to predict what will happen.\n剑桥雅思18 Test3 Part3雅思听力答案\n21-22. AE\n23-24. BD\n25. G\n26. E\n27. B\n28. C\n29. F\n30. A"

In other words, a SpaceTrafic Management system. We already have effective Air Traffic Control systems that are used internationally to ensure that planes navigate our skies safely. Well, Space TrafficManagement is a similar concept, but focusing on the control of satellites.\nThe aim of such a system would be to prevent the danger of collisions in space between the objects in orbit around the Earth. In order to do this, we’d need to have a set of legal measures, and we’d also have to develop the\ntechnical (Q31)\nsystems to enable us to prevent such accidents.\nBut unfortunately, at present we don’t actually have a Space Traffic Management system that works. So why not? What are the problems in developing such a system?\nWell, for one thing, satellites are relatively\ncheap (Q32)\nthese days, compared with how they were in the past, meaning that more people can afford to put them into space. So there’s a lot more of them out there, and people aren’t just launching single satellites but whole constellations, consisting of\nthousands (Q33)\nof them designed to work together. So space is getting more crowded every day.\nBut in spite of this, one thing you may be surprised to leam is that you can launch a satellite into space and, once it’s out there, it doesn’t have to send back any information to Earth to allow its\nidentification (Q34)\n. So while we have international systems for ensuring we know where the planes in our skies are, and to prevent them from colliding with one another, when it comes to the safety of satellites, at present we don’t have anything like enough proper ways of\ntracking (Q35)\nthem.\nAnd it isn’t just entire satellites that we need to consider. A greater threat is the huge amount of space debris in orbit around the Earth – broken bits of satellite and junk from space stations and so on. And some of these are so small that they can be very hard to identify, but they can still be very dangerous.\nIn addition, some operators,  may be unwilling to share information about the satellites they’ve launched. For example, a satellite may be designed for\nmilitary (Q36)\npurposes, or it may have been launched for commercial reasons, and the operators don’t want competitors to have information about it.\nAnd even if the operators are willing to provide it, the information isn’t easy to collect. Details are needed about the object itself as well as about its\nlocation (Q37)\nat a particular time – and remember that a satellite isn’t very big, and it’s likely to be moving at thousands of kilometers an hour. We don’t have any sensors that can constantly follow something moving so fast, so all that the scientists can do is to put forward a\nprediction (Q38)\nconcerning where the satellite is heading next.\nSo those are some of the problems that we’re facing. Let’s consider now some of the solutions that have been suggested. One key issue is the way in which information is dealt with. We need more information, but it also needs to be accessible at a global level, so we need to establish shared standards that we can all agree on for the way in which this information is presented. We already do this in other areas of science, so although this is a challenge, it’s not an impossible task. Then, as all this information’s collected, it needs to be put together so it can be used, and that will involve creating a single\ndatabase (Q39)\non which it can be entered.\nAs we continue to push forward new developments, congestion of the space environment is only going to increase. To cope with this, we need to develop a system like the one I’ve described to coordinate the work of the numerous spacecraft operators, but it’s also essential that this system is one that establishes\ntrust (Q40)\nin the people that use it, both nationally and at a global level.\nOne interesting development …\n剑桥雅思18 Test4 Part3雅思听力答案\n31. technical\n32. cheap\n33. thousands\n34. identification\n35. tracking\n36. military\n37. location\n38. prediction\n39. database\n40. trust"

Is that Julie Davison?\nJULIE:\nYes.\nGREG:\nThis is Greg Preston from the Employment Agency. We met last week when you came in to enquire about office work.\nJULIE:\nOh, that’s right.\nGREG:\nNow we’ve just had some details come in of a job which might interest you.\nJULIE:\nOK.\nGREG:\nSo this is a position for a\nreceptionist (Q1)\n– I believe you’ve done that sort of work before?\nJULIE:\nYes, I have, I worked in a sports centre for a couple of years before I got married and had the children.\nGREG:\nRight. Well, this job’s in Fordham, so not too far away for you, and it’s at the\nmedical (Q2)\ncentre there.\nJULIE:\nOK. So where exactly is that?\nGREG:\nIt’s quite near the station, on Chastons Road.\nJULIE:\nSorry?\nGREG:\nChastons (Q3)\nRoad – that’s C-H-A-S-T-O-N-S.\nJULIE:\nOK, thanks. So what would the work involve? Dealing with enquiries from patients?\nGREG:\nYes, and you’d also be involved in making\nappointments (Q4)\n, whether face to face or on the phone. And rescheduling them if necessary.\nJULIE:\nFine, that shouldn’t be a problem.\nGREG:\nAnd another of your duties would be keeping the centre’s\ndatabase (Q5)\nup-to-date. Then you might have other general administrative duties as well, but those would be the main ones.\nJULIE:\nOK.\nGREG:\nNow when the details came in, I immediately thought of you because one thing they do require is someone with\nexperience (Q6)\n, and you did mention your work at the sports centre when you came in to see us.\nJULIE:\nYes, in fact I enjoyed that job. Is there anything else they’re looking for?\nGREG:\nWell, they say it’s quite a high-pressure environment, they’re always very busy, and patients are often under stress, so they want someone who can cope with that and stay calm, and at the same time be\nconfident (Q7)\nwhen interacting with the public.\nJULIE:\nWell, after dealing with three children all under five, I reckon I can cope with that.\nGREG:\nI’m sure you can.\nGREG:\nAnd then another thing they mention is that they’re looking for someone with good IT skills.\nJULIE:\nNot a problem.\nGREG:\nSo you’d be interested in following this up?\nJULIE:\nSure. When would it start?\nGREG:\nWell, they’re looking for someone from the beginning of next month, but I should tell you that this isn’t a permanent job, it’s\ntemporary (Q8)\n, so the contract would be just to the end of September. But they do say that there could be further opportunities after that.\nJULIE:\nOK. And what would the hours be?\nGREG:\nWell, they want someone who can start at a quarter to eight in the morning – could you manage that?\nJULIE:\nYes, my husband would have to get the kids up and off to my mother’s – she’s going to be looking after them while I’m at work. What time would I finish?\nGREG:\nOne fifteen (Q9)\n.\nJULIE:\nThat should work out all right. I can pick the kids up on my way home, and then I’ll have the afternoon with them. Oh, one thing .. is there\nparking (Q10)\navailable for staff at the centre?\nGREG:\nYes, there is, and it’s also on a bus route.\nJULIE:\nRight. Well, I expect I’ll have the car but it’s good to know that.\nGREG:\nOK, so where do l go from here?\nJULIE:\nWell, if you’re happy for me to do so, I’ll forward your CV and references, and then the best thing would probably be for you to phone them so they can arrange for an interview.\nGREG:\nGreat. Well thank you very much.\nJULIE:\nYou’re welcome. Bye now.\nGREG:\nBye.\n剑桥雅思18 Test4 Part1雅思听力答案\n1. receptionist\n2. medical\n3.

I understand it’s your first visit here, so I’d like to give you some background information about the museum and then explain a little about what you can see during your visit.\nSo, where we’re standing at the moment is the entrance to\na large building that was constructed in 1880 as the home of a local businessman (Q11)\n, Alfred Palmer, of the Palmer biscuit factory. It was later sold and became a hall of residence for students in 1911, and a museum in 1951. In 2005, a modern extension was built to accommodate the museum’s collections.\nThe museum’s owned by the university, and apart from two rooms that are our offices,\nthe university uses the main part of the building. You may see students going into the building for lessons (Q12)\n, but it’s not open to museum visitors, I’m afraid. It’s a shame because the interior architectural features are outstanding, especially the room that used to be the library.\nLuckily, we’ve managed to keep entry to the museum free. This includes access to all the galleries, outdoor areas and the rooms for special exhibitions. We run activities for children and students, such as the museum club, for which there’s no charge.\nWe do have a donation box just over there so feel free to give whatever amount you consider appropriate (Q13)\n.\nWe do have a cloakroom, if you’d like to leave your coats and bags somewhere (Q14)\n. Unlike other museums, photography is allowed here, so you might like to keep your cameras with you. You might be more comfortable not carrying around heavy rucksacks, though\nkeep your coats and jackets on as it’s quite cold in the museum garden today (Q14)\n.\nI’d like to tell you about the different areas of the museum.\nJust inside, and outside the main gallery, we have an area called Four Seasons. Here you can watch a four-minute animation of a woodland scene.\nIt was designed especially for the museum by a group of young people on a film studies course (Q15)\n, and it’s beautiful. Children absolutely love it, but then, so do adults.\nThe main gallery’s called Town and Country. It includes a photographic collection of prize-winning sheep and shepherds. Leaving Town and Country,  you enter Farmhouse Kitchen, which is …well, self-explanatory. Here we have the oldest collection of equipment for making butter and cheese in the country.\nAnd this morning, a specialist cheesemaker will be giving demonstrations of how it’s produced (Q16)\n. You may even get to try some.\nAfter that, you can go in two directions. To the right is a staircase that takes you up to a landing from where you can look down on the galleries. To the left is a room called A Year on the Farm. There’s lots of seating here as sometimes we use the room for school visits, so it’s a good place to stop for a rest.\nIf you’re feeling competitive, you can take our memory test in which you answer questions about things you’ve seen in the museum (Q17)\n.\nThe next area’s called Wagon Walk. This contains farm carts from nearly every part of the country. It’s surprising how much regional variation there was. Beside the carts are display boards with information about each one.\nThe carts are old and fragile, so we ask you to keep your children close to you and ensure they don’t climb on the carts (Q18)\n.\nFrom Wagon Walk, you can either make your way back to reception or go out into the garden- or even go back to take another look in the galleries. In the far corner of the garden is Beesare Magic,\nbut we’re redeveloping this area so you can’t visit that at the moment (Q19)\n. You can still buy our honey in the shop, though.\nFinally, there’s The Pond, which contains all kinds of interesting wildlife.\nThere are baby ducks that are only a few days old, as well as tiny frogs (Q20)\n. The Pond isn’t deep and there’s a fence around it, so it’s perfectly safe for children.\n剑桥雅思18 Test4 Part2雅思听力答案\n11. B\n12. A\n13. A\n14. C\n15. F\n16. G\n17. E\n18. A\n19. C\n20. B"

Can you all work with the person sitting next to you?\nSEB:\nI had no idea that such a simple thing like folding squares of paper to make the shape of something like a bird could be such an amazing tool. It’s made me see origami in a whole new light.\nLIA:\nI know. It was interesting to see the educational skills the children were developing by doing origami. On the video,\nyou could see them really listening hard to make sure they did all the steps in the right order to make the bird (Q21)\n.\nSEB:\nThat’s right. In this lesson they were working individually but it would also be interesting to see if the children could work out how to make something simple without being given any direction. That would help with building teamwork as well.\nLIA:\nYes, but much more of a challenge. One thing that really stood out for me was that\nthe children were all having fun while being taught something new (Q22)\n.\nSEB:\nWhich is a key aim of any lesson with this age group. And although these kids had no problems with folding the paper, with younger children you could do origami to help practise fine motor skills.\nLIA:\nAbsolutely. Shall we talk about the individual children we saw on the video? I wrote all their names down and took some notes.\nSEB:\nYes, I did too.\nLIA:\nOK, good. Let’s start with Sid.\nSEB:\nHe was interesting because before they started doing the origami, he was being quite disruptive.\nLIA:\nYes. He really benefited from having to use his hands –\nit helped him to settle down and start concentrating (Q23)\n.\nSEB:\nYes, I noticed that too. What about Jack? I noticed he seemed to want to work things out for himself.\nLIA:\nMmm.\nYou could see him trying out different things rather than asking the teacher for help (Q24)\n. What did you make of Naomi?\nSEB:\nShe seemed to be losing interest at one point but then\nshe decided she wanted her mouse to be the best and that motivated her to try harder (Q25)\n.\nLIA:\nShe didn’t seem satisfied with hers in the end, though.\nSEB:\nNo.\nLIA:\nAnya was such a star.\nShe listened so carefully and then produced the perfect bird with very little effort (Q26)\n.\nSEB:\nMmm – I think the teacher could have increased the level of difficulty for her.\nLIA:\nMaybe. I think it was the first time Zara had come across origami.\nSEB:\nShe looked as if she didn’t really get what was going on.\nLIA:\nShe seemed unsure about what she was supposed to do (Q27)\n, but in the end hers didn’t turn out too badly.\nSEB:\nYeah. I’m sure it was a positive learning experience for her.\nLIA:\nMmm.\nLIA:\nI think one reason why the origami activity worked so well in this class was that the teacher was well-prepared.\nSEB:\nRight. I think it would have taken me ages to\nprepare examples, showing each of the steps involved in making the bird (Q28)\n. But that was a really good idea. The children could see what they were aiming for – and much better for them to be able to hold something, rather than just looking at pictures.\nLIA:\nMmm – those physical examples supported her verbal explanations really well.\nSEB:\nIt’s strange that origami isn’t used more widely. Why do you think that is?\nLIA:\nWell, teachers may just feel it’s not that appealing to children who are used to doing everything on computers, especially boys. Even if they’re aware of the benefits.\nSEB:\nOh, I don’t know. It’s no different to any other craft activity.\nI bet it’s because some teachers are clumsy like me (Q29)\n.\nLIA:\nThat’s true – too much effort required if you’re not good with your hands.\nSEB:\nWell, anyway, I think we should try it out in our maths teaching practice with Year 3. I can see using origami is a really engaging way of reinforcing children’s knowledge of geometric shapes, like they were doing in the video, but\nI think it would also work really well for presenting fractions, which is coming up soon (Q30)\n.\nLIA:\nGood idea – that’s something most of the kids in that class might struggle with. Origami would also be good practice for using symmetry – but I think they did that last term.\nSEB:\nOK – well let’s try and get some ideas together and plan the lesson next week.\nTUTOR:\nOK, if you could all stop…\n剑桥雅思18 Test4 Part3雅思听力答案\n21-22.

It became a stage musical in the 1980s, and a film version was also released in 2012. So, some of us, I’m sure, have a pretty general idea of the\nplot (Q31)\n, but we know much less about the author. Today, I’m going to provide a little more insight into this talented man and I’m going to talk particularly about the home he had on the island of Guemsey in the British Channel islands.\nBut first, his early career … as I’ve said, he was a writer, he was at the height of his career in Paris and he was very highly regarded by his colleagues. As far as literature was concerned, he was the leading figure of the Romantic movement. However, as well as being a literary genius, he also gave many speeches about issues like the level of\npoverty (Q32)\nin his society. He felt very strongly about this and about other areas where change was needed, like education. This kind of outspoken criticism was not well-liked by the rulers of France and, eventually, the emperor – Napoleon III – told Victor Hugo to leave Paris and not return; in other words, he sent him into exile.\nSo Victor Hugo was forced to reside in other parts of\nEurope (Q33)\n. Guernsey was actually his third place of exile and he landed there in 1855. He produced a lot while on Guernsey – including Les Miserables – and to do this, he had to spend a great deal of time in the home that he had there. This was a property that he bought using the money he’d made in France from the publication of a collection of his\npoetry (Q34)\n. It was the only property he ever owned, and he was very proud of it.\nThe property Victor Hugo bought on Guernsey was a large, five-storey house in the capital town of St Peter Port and he lived there for 15 years, returning to France in 1870 when Napoleon’s Empire collapsed. He decorated and furnished each level, or floor, of the house in unique and wonderful ways, and many people consider the inside of the house to be a ‘work of art’. Today it’s a museum that attracts 200,000 visitors a year.\nHe lived in the house with his family .. and portraits of its members still hang in rooms on the ground floor, along with\ndrawings (Q35)\nthat he did during his travels that he felt were important to him. In other ground-floor rooms, there are huge tapestries that he would have designed and loved. The walls are covered in dark wood paneling that Victor Hugo created himself using wooden\nfurniture (Q36)\nthat he bought in the market. The items were relatively inexpensive, and he used them to create intricate carvings. They gave an atmosphere on the lower level that was shadowy and rather solemn.\nOn the next level of the house there are two impressive lounges, where he entertained his guests. One lounge has entirely red furnishings, such as sofas and wall coverings, and the other blue. There’s a strong Chinese influence in these areas in things like the wallpaper pattern and the\nlamps (Q37)\n– which he would have made himself by copying original versions.\nHis library, where he left many of his favourite books, forms the hallway to the third floor and was a comfortable area where he could relax and enjoy his afternoons. And then, at the very top of the house, there’s a room called the Lookout – called that because it looks out over the\nharbor (Q38)\n. In contrast to the rather dark lower levels, it’s full of light and was like a glass office where he would write until lunchtime – often at his desk.\nSo, Victor Hugo was a man of many talents, but he was also true to his values. While living in his house on Guernsey, he entertained many other famous writers, but he also invited a large group of local\nchildren (Q39)\nfrom the deprived areas of the island to dinner once a week. What’s more, he served them their food, which was an extraordinary gesture for the time period.\nIn 1927, the house was owned by his\nrelatives (Q40)\n, and they decided to donate it to the city of Paris. It has since been restored using photographs from the period and, as I mentioned earlier, is now a museum that is open to the public.\n剑桥雅思18 Test4 Part4雅思听力答案\n31. plot\n32. poverty\n33.

The items were relatively inexpensive, and he used them to create intricate carvings\n答案解析：这道题采用语序颠倒的手法，将原本位于空前的提示词cheap（对应inexpensive）放在了答案之后，需要大家根据wooden来锁定furniture。\n第37题答案：lamps\n对应原文：There’s a strong Chinese influence in these areas in things like the wallpaper pattern and the\nlamps\n答案解析：听到Chinese意识到答案即将到来，并列词wallpaper没有任何替换，很容易确定lamps为正确答案。\n第38题答案：harbour/harbor\n对应原文：there’s a room called the Lookout – called that because it looks out over the\nharbor\n答案解析：听到room意识到答案即将到来，空前词view与looks out同义替换，由此锁定harbor为正确答案。\n第39题答案：children\n对应原文：he entertained many other famous writers, but he also invited a large group of local\nchildren\nfrom the deprived areas\n答案解析：听到entertained和writers意识到答案即将到来，空前修饰词poor与deprived areas同义替换，再加上空上应该填某种人，因此锁定children。\n第40题答案：relatives\n对应原文：In 1927, the house was owned by his\nrelatives\n, and they decided to donate it to the city of Paris.\n答案解析：听到1927意识到答案即将到来，空前词Victor Hugo’s对应his，根据修饰关系确定relatives为正确答案。"

How can I help you?\nMAN: I understand that the school organizes… umm, trips to different…\nWOMAN: Yes, we run\nfive every month\n: three during weekends and two Wednesday afternoon trips.  Example\nMAN: What sort of places?\nWOMAN: Well, obviously it varies, but always places of historical interest and also which offer\na variety of shopping\n,\nbecause our students always ask about that… and then we go for ones where we know there are\nguided tours\n,\nbecause this gives a good focus for the visit.\nQ1 Q2\nMAN: Do you travel far?\nWOMAN: Well, we’re lucky here, obviously, because we’re able to say that all our visits are less than three hours’ drive.\nMAN: How much do they cost?\nWOMAN: Again it varies – between five and fifteen pounds a head, depending on the distance.\nMAN: Ah ha…\nWOMAN: Oh, and we do offer to arrange special trips if, you know, there are\nmore than twelve\npeople.\nQ3\nMAN: Oh right, I’ll keep that in mind. And what are the times normally?\nWOMAN: We try to keep it pretty fixed so that, that students get to know the pattern.  We leave at eight-thirty a.m. and return at six p.m. We figure it’s best to keep the day fairly short. MAN: Oh yes. And how do we reserve a place?\nWOMAN: You sign your name on the\nnotice board\n. Do you know where it is?\nQ4\nMAN: Ah ha. I saw it this morning.\nWOMAN: And we do ask that you sign up three days in advance so we know we’ve got enough people interested to run it, and we can cancel if necessary, with full refund of course.\nMAN: That’s fine, thanks.\nMAN: And what visits are planned for this term?\nWOMAN: Right, well I’m afraid the schedule hasn’t been printed out yet, but we have confirmed the dates and planned the optional extra visits which you can also book in advance if you want to.\nMAN: Oh that’s all right. If you can just give some idea of the weekend ones so I can, you know, work out when to see friends, etcetera.\nWOMAN: Oh sure. Well, the first one is St Ives. That’s on\nthe thirteenth of February\nand\nwe’ll have only sixteen places available ‘cos we’re going by minibus. And that’s a day in town with the optional extra of visiting the Hepworth Museum.\nQ5\nMAN: Oh right… yeah… that sounds good.\nWOMAN: Then there’s a London trip on the sixteenth of February and we’ll be taking a medium-sized coach so there’ll be forty-five places on that, and, let’s see, the optional extra is\nthe\nTower of London\n.  Q6\nMAN: Oh, I’ve already been there.\nWOMAN: After that there’s\nBristol\non the third of March.\nQ7\nMAN: Where?\nWOMAN:\nBristol… B-R-I-S-T-O-L.\nMAN: OK…\nWOMAN: That’s in a different minibus with eighteen places available, oh, and the optional extra is a visit to the S.S.

Is Bath the Roman city?\nWOMAN: Yes, that’s right, and that’s in the sixteen-seater minibus.\nMAN: And where’s the optional visit?\nWOMAN: It’s to the\nAmerican\nMuseum\n–\nwell worth a visit.\nQ8\nMAN: OK, well that’s great, thanks for all that…\nWOMAN: My pleasure.

To start your visit I’m just going to give you a brief account of the history of the museum before letting you roam about on your own. I won’t keep you long. OK?\nNow, from where we’re standing you’ve got a good view of the river over there. And it was because of this fast-flowing water that this site was a natural place for manufacturing works. The water and the availability of raw materials in the area, like minerals and iron ore, and also the abundance of local fuels, like\ncoal and firewood\n, all made this site suitable for industry from a very early time.\nWater was the main source of power for the early industries and some of the water wheels were first established in the twelfth century, would you believe? At that time,\nlocal craftsmen\nfirst built an iron forge just behind the village here, on the bend in the river.  By the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the region’s rivers supported more than\na hundred and sixty\nwatermills – and many of these continued to operate well into the nineteenth century. But then the steam engine was invented and then the railways came and the centers of industry were able to move away from the rivers and the countryside and into the towns. So, industrial villages like this one became very rare.\nSo that’s the history for you. If you’d like any more information, you can ask me some questions, or you can read further in our excellent guide book.\nNow I’m going to give you a plan of the site and I’d just like to point out where everything is and then you can take a look at everything for yourself.\nI’ve already pointed out the river which is on the left. And of course, running along the bottom is\nWoodside\nRoad, got it? OK. Now we’re standing at the entrance, see it at the bottom, and immediately to our right is the\nTicket Office.\nYou won’t need that because you’ve got your group booking, but just past it are the toilets -always good to know where they are. In front of us is the car park, as you can see, and to the left, by the entry gate is the\nGift Shop.\nThat’s where you can get copies of the guide, like this one here.\nNow, beyond the car park, all the buildings are arranged in a half circle with a yard in the middle. The big, stone building at the top is the\nmain Workshop\n. That’s where the furnace is and where all the metal was smelted and the tools were cast, as you’ll be able to see. Now, in the top right-hand comer, that building with bigger windows is the\nShowroom\n, where samples of all the tools that were made through the ages are on display. In the top left corner is the Grinding Shop, where the tools were sharpened and finished. And on one side of that, you can see the Engine Room and on the other is the\nCafé\n, which isn’t an antique, you’ll be pleased to know, though they do serve very nice old-fashioned teas.\nThe row of buildings you can see on the left are the\ncottages\n. These were built for the workers towards the end of the eighteenth century and they’re still furnished from that period so you can get a good idea of ordinary people’s living conditions. Across the yard from them, you can see the stables where the horses were kept for transporting the products. And the separate building in front of them is the Works Office and that still has some of the old accounts on display.\nRight, if anyone wants a guided tour then I’m starting at the Engine Room. If you’d like to come along, this way please, ladies and gentlemen.\n剑桥雅思4Test 1听力Section2答案解析\n雅思备考听力篇 剑4 test 1 section 2 雅思听力高频词汇"

Well, Melanie, how can I help you?\nMELANIE: I’m… having a bit of trouble with the second assignment, and it’s due in twelve days.\nDR JOHNSON: What sort of trouble are you having? Is the assignment question a problem?\nMELANIE: Well, that’s part of the problem.   I’m also having – been having – trouble getting hold of the books. I’ve been to the library several times, and all the books are out.\nDR JOHNSON: Sounds like you should have started borrowing books a bit earlier.\nMELANIE: Well, I had\na really big assignment due in for another course\n, and I’ve been spending all my time on that, and I thought…\nQ21\nDR JOHNSON: … You might get an extension of time to finish your assignment for me?\nMELANIE: If that’s possible, but I don’t know…\nDR JOHNSON: Well, yes, it is possible, but extensions are normally given only for\nmedical or compassionate reasons\n, otherwise it’s really a question of organizing your study, and we don’t like giving extensions to students who simply didn’t plan their work properly. What did you get for your first assignment?\nQ22\nMELANIE: I got eighty-seven percent.\nDR JOHNSON: Mmm, yes, you did very well indeed, so obviously you can produce good work.\nMELANIE: I don’t think I’ll need too much extra time, as long as I can get hold of some of the important references.\nDR JOHNSON: Well, since you did so well in your first assignment, I’m prepared to give you an extra two weeks for this one, so that’ll mean you’ll need to submit it about a month from now.\nMELANIE: Thank you.\nDR JOHNSON: Now, what about the reading materials? Have you checked out the journal articles in the list?\nMELANIE: Umm, no, not yet, there were about twenty of them, and I wasn’t sure which ones would be most useful or important.\nDR JOHNSON: Well, they’re all useful, but I don’t expect anyone to read them all, because a number of them deal with the same issues. Let me give you some suggestions. The article by Anderson and Hawker is really worth reading.\nMELANIE: Right, I’ll read that one.\nDR JOHNSON: You should also read the article by Jackson, but just look at the part on the\nresearch methodology\n– how they did it.\nQ23\nMELANIE: OK… Jackson, got that…\nDR JOHNSON: And if you have time, the one by Roberts says very relevant things, although it’s not essential.\nMELANIE: So, OK, if it’s\nuseful\n. I’ll try and read that one…\nQ24\nDR JOHNSON: NOw, the one by Morris. I wouldn’t bother with that at this stage, if I were you.\nMELANIE: OK, I\nwon’t bother with Morris\n. Oh, now, someone told me the article by Cooper is important.\nQ25\nDR JOHNSON: Well, yes, in a way, but just look at\nthe last part\n, where he discusses the research results. And lastly, there’s Forster – I can’t think why I included that one. It’s not bad and\ncould be of some help, but not that much.\nQ26 Q27\nDR JOHNSON: Now, let’s deal with the assignment question. What’s the problem there?\nMELANIE: It’s the graph on page two.\nDR JOHNSON: What seems to be the problem? It’s just the bar graph showing the reasons why people change where they live.\nMELANIE: Well, I’ve got a photocopy but the reasons at the bottom are missing.\nDR JOHNSON: Ah, OK. Look at the first bar on the graph – now that indicates the number of people who move because they want more space.\nMELANIE: Oh I see… bar one. OK… Now, what about the next bar?\nDR JOHNSON: Bar two is to do with\nthe people living nearby disturbing them\n, so they chose to move away to somewhere quieter. Now let’s look at bar number three… another reason people change their place of living is that they want to be closer to the city.\nQ28\nMELANIE: OK.

I have been asked today to talk to you about the urban landscape. There are two major areas that I will focus on in my talk: how vegetation can have a significant effect on urban climate, and how we can better plan our\ncities using trees to provide a more comfortable environment\nfor us to live in.\nQ31\nTrees can have a significant impact on our cities. They can make a city, as a whole,\na bit less\nwindy\nor a bit more windy, if that’s what you want. They can make it a bit cooler if it’s a hot summer day in an Australian city,  they can make it\na bit more\nhumid\nif it’s a dry inland city. On the local scale – that is, in particular areas within the city – trees can make the\nlocal area more shady\n, cooler, more humid and much less windy. In fact, trees and planting of various kinds can be used to make city streets\nactually less dangerous\nin particular areas. How do trees do all that, you ask?\nQ32 Q33 Q34 Q35\nWell, the main difference between a tree and a building is a tree has got an internal mechanism to keep the temperature regulated. It\nevaporates water through its leaves\nand that means that the temperature of the leaves is never very far from our own body temperature. The temperature of a building surface on a hot sunny day can easily be twenty degrees more than our temperature. Trees, on the other hand, remain cooler than buildings because they sweat. This means that they can humidify the air and cool it – a property which can be exploited to improve the local climate.\nQ36\nTrees can also help break the force of winds. The reason that high buildings make it windier\nat ground level\nis that, as the wind goes higher and higher, it goes faster and faster. When the wind hits the building, it has to go somewhere. Some of it goes over the top and some go around the sides of the building, forcing those high-level winds down to ground level. That doesn’t happen when you have trees.\nTrees\nfilter the wind and considerably reduce it.\npreventing those very large strong gusts that you so often find around tall buildings.\nQ37 Q38\nAnother problem in built-up areas is that traffic noise is intensified by tall buildings. By planting a belt of trees at the side of the road, you can make things a little quieter, but much of the vehicle noise still goes through the trees. Trees can also help reduce the amount of noise in the surroundings, although the effect is not as large as people like to think.\nLow- frequency noise\n, in particular, just goes through the trees as though they aren’t there.\nQ39\nAlthough trees can significantly improve the local climate, they do however take up a lot of space. There are root systems to consider and branches blocking windows and so on. It may, therefore, be difficult to fit trees into the local landscape. There is not a great deal you can do if you have what we call a street canyon – a whole set of high-rises enclosed in a narrow street. Trees need water to grow. They also need some sunlight to grow and\nyou need room to put them\n. If you have the chance of knocking buildings down and replacing them, then suddenly you can start looking at different ways to design the streets and to introduce… (fade out)\nQ40\n剑桥雅思4Test 1听力Section4答案解析\n雅思备考听力篇 剑4 test 1 section 4 雅思听力高频词汇"

You’ve been ages. What kept you so long?\nPETER: I’m sorry I’m so late, Sally. Have you been waiting long?\nSALLY: Oh,\nhalf an hour\n. But it doesn’t matter. I’ve had a coffee and I’ve been reading this guidebook for tourists. Sit down. You look very hot and tired. What would you like to drink?\nExample\nPETER: I’d love a really\nchilled mineral water\nor something. Will you have another coffee?\nQ1\nSALLY: Yes, I will. The waitress will be back in a moment. Why were you so late? Did something happen?\nPETER: Yes. You know I went to the bank to cash some travelers cheques?  Well, the exchange rate was looking healthy, but when I went to the teller, they told me the\ncomputer system was temporarily down\n, so they couldn’t do any transactions. They said the problem would be fixed in a few minutes, so I waited. And then I started talking to another guy in the bank, and I forgot the time.\nQ2\nSALLY: Oh, really? Someone you met in the bank? Does he work there?\nPETER: NO,\nhe was\na tourist, from New York\n. His name’s Henry, and he’s been here for a week, but he’s moving on to Germany tomorrow. He’s an architect, and he’s spending four weeks traveling around Europe.\nQ3\nSALLY: Just like us!\nPETER: Yeah, just like us. He told me the names of some places where we should eat. Great food, and not too expensive, he said. Oh, and he also gave me\nthis map of the bus system\n. He said he didn’t need it anymore.\nQ4\nSALLY: That’s useful. Pity he’s moving on tomorrow. Ah, here’s the waitress. Let’s order. Do you want anything to eat, or shall we just have a drink?\nPETER: Well, I’m hungry, and we’ve got a lot of sightseeing to do, so let’s just have\na snack and a drink\n.\nQ5\nSALLY: Sounds good to me!\nPETER: Well, let’s decide what we’ll see today. I guess the best place to start is the Cathedral, and then the Castle. What are the opening times for those two?\nSALLY: Well, according to this guidebook, the Cathedral is only open from nine-thirty in the morning until midday. No, hang on. That’s the Cathedral Museum.\nThe\nCathedral itself is open morning and afternoon\n. The Castle is just open from one to five, so we can’t go there until after lunch. I really want to spend some time in the Art Gallery, because they’ve got this wonderful painting by Rembrandt that I’ve always wanted to see.\nQ6\nPETER: What else should we see?\nSALLY: Well, the guidebook says the Botanical Gardens are worth spending some time in, and they’re open all day, from eight to six, so we can go there any time. I’d like to go to the Markets near the river too, but… oh… no, wait, that’s only in the mornings, too.\nPETER: AS well as today and tomorrow, we can see some other places on Monday, you know.\nBut\nI don’t think the Markets will be open then\n; they only open on Thursdays, so we’ve missed them for this week. Maybe we should go to the Cathedral today because it’s Sunday tomorrow, and even though it’s open every day it might be more difficult to get in tomorrow because of the church services.\nQ7\nSALLY: That’s true, but the Art Gallery isn’t open on Sundays at all, so we’ll have to go there today. The Castle’s open every day except Mondays, so we’re OK there, and the Gardens of course only close at night.\nPETER: Are all these places free or do we have to pay to go in? What does the guidebook say?\nSALLY: I think there’s\na charge for all of them except the Botanical Gardens\n. Oh, and the Markets, of course, you don’t pay to go in.\nQ8\nPETER: OK, well, it looks like our plan is this:\nwe’ll go to see the painting you like first\n, the Rembrandt, then have lunch and go on to the Castle after that, and then the Cathedral.\nQ9\nSALLY: OK. It says here that the roof of the Cathedral is really beautiful.\nPETER: IS that right? What I really want to do at the Cathedral is\nclimb the tower.\nThe view is supposed to be spectacular.\nQ10\nSALLY: OK, well, that’ll be more than enough for today. Then, tomorrow, let’s go to the Botanical Gardens and have a picnic. I want to sit by the river and watch the swans. This city’s famous for them.\n剑桥雅思4 test 2 Section 2听力原文与答案"

If you’re confused about subjects or how to combine them in your degree, then we can advise you and discuss the career you are aiming for, so that you can see it all in context.\nWe can also chase up your tutor if you’re not getting proper feedback on how you are getting on in your subject.\nQ11\nBesides help with academic problems, you may also need personal counseling: if you think you’re already under stress, well, just wait till classes begin next week.  You’ll have to start adjusting to teaching and learning methods that may be unfamiliar to you, as well as the\nmounting pressure as the\ndeadline for that first assignment creeps up on you\n.\nAnd of course, you have to cope with all this without your usual social network – you know, the social contacts. family and friends,\nyou could normally rely on for help\n. All of this causes anxiety. . Studying overseas can trigger a personal crisis – you may have left a lot of what you might call ‘unfinished business’ back in your own country, or you may have\ninterrupted personal relationships\nor even sometimes have broken them off to come overseas, and so the student often feels lonely, unhappy, unmotivated and unable to concentrate on studying. Or there may be other things bothering you. Our resident chaplain can offer you spiritual guidance if that’s what you want, or we can put you in touch with community groups that can provide you with social contacts and friendship.\nQ12 Q13 Q14\nWhat about exam stress? It affects nearly everyone to some extent, but especially overseas students like yourselves. There may be a huge amount of family pressure on you to succeed, and\nif you fail a subject or drop out of a course because it’s too difficult then your self-esteem can suffer.\nBut it’s not the end of the world if you don’t pass an exam – I had to resit First Year Anthropology, so I can certainly offer you a sympathetic ear! Anyway, exam failure can lead to worrying changes in the way you normally behave. You may also be off your food, or you may have dietary problems because\nthe local food is not to your liking\nand upsets you, and this can affect your health and studies. Glenda Roberts is our dietician in the Health Service and we can put you on to her.\nQ15 Q16\nAnd we all have money problems, don’t we? But remember, full-time students can get a\nl\now-interest loan of up to six hundred dollars to buy books\nand for similar study-related expenses. That’s right, and you can get double that amount if you can’t afford an item of equipment you need for your course – a musical instrument, for example. And it doesn’t stop there.\nWhen you move into a flat, starting-up expense, including furniture for it\n, can be covered by a loan through the Welfare Service – see Jill Freeman for details.\nQ17 Q18\nCan we help you? Well, last academic year, in spite of staff cuts,\nwe counseled two hundred and forty international students\nfor a total of twenty-six hundred hours counseling, and, finally we won all but just one of the twelve appeals that we launched on behalf of students.\nNot too bad for an understaffed service\n, don’t you think?

Sorry, I’m a bit late – there was a long queue. So, have you worked out how to deal with this assignment then?\nMICK: Not yet, we’ve only been here a couple of minutes ourselves.\nROSA: Can you just remind me what the task is exactly?\nPETE: Well, there are two, no, three, parts to it: first, we’ve got to write an essay about ways of collecting data. Then…\nROSA: What’s the title of the essay exactly?\nMICK: I’ve got it here: Assess the two main methods of\ncollecting data\nin social science research’.\nQ21\nROSA: And how much do we need to write?\nMICK:\nFifteen hundred words\n. That’s for the essay. Then, for the second part of the assignment, we have to choose one method of data collection, and ‘carry out a small-scale study, making appropriate use of the method chosen to gather data from at least\nfive subjects\n’.\nQ22 Q23\nROSA: And then we have to write a report on the study?\nPETE: That’s right, of\nthree to four thousand words\n.\nQ24\nROSA: Did you get as far as discussing which form of data collection we should go for -questionnaire or interview, isn’t it?\nMICK: Yeah, I think we should use a questionnaire. It’ll be so much less time-consuming than organizing interviews, I reckon. Once we’ve agreed on the wording of it, we only have to send it out and wait for the responses.\nROSA: Yes, I think it probably would be quicker. But what did that article he gave us last week say about the quality of data from questionnaires?\nMICK: I’m pretty sure it recommended questionnaires as a source of ‘highly reliable data’. As long as you design the questionnaire properly in the first place, the data will be fine.\nROSA: No, I’m sure it talked about drawbacks as well, didn’t it? Something about the\nresponse rate and the problems you get if it’s too low.\nQ25\nMCK: Yeah, but we only need data from five subjects anyway.\nROSA: I suppose SO. Another drawback I remember it mentioned was that questionnaire data\ntends not to reveal anything unexpected\n, because it is limited to the questions fixed in advance by the researcher.\nQ26\nMICK: Come on, Rosa. This is only a practice. It’s not meant to be real research, is it?\nROSA: Well, I’m not sure about that.\nROSA: Maybe I’d better go through the article again, just to be sure. Can you remember what it was called?\nMICK: ‘Sample Surveys in Social Science Research’, I think. By\nMehta\n.\nQ27\nROSA: M-E-H-T-A ?\nMICK: Yeah. And he also recommended a more recent book, called ‘\nSurvey Research\n’, by Bell, I think. It’s in that series published by\nLondon University\n.\nQ28 Q29\nPETE: And if we tried to use interviews instead, I saw a book in the departmental library that’ll be helpful: it’s called ‘Interviews That Work’, by Wilson, published in Oxford in\nnineteen eighty-eight\n.\nQ30\nROSA: Right. I’ve got a tutorial now. Can we meet up again later this week? What about Friday morning?\nPETE: Suits me. Eleven o’clock?\nROSA: Fine.\nMICK: Before Friday, I think we should all look through the reading list.\n剑4 test 2 Section 3雅思听力答案\n21. collecting data\n22. 1500\n23. 5\n24. 3000-4000\n25-26. BC\n27.

It’s been defined as, quote, ‘crime which is committed for the corporate organization’ – the company – ‘not against it’, unquote.\nQ31\nSo\ncrimes like theft by employees – things like embezzlement or fraud against one’s actual employer are excluded according to this definition\n. The employees may be involved but they’re acting in the first place for the company – they may not even realize they’re committing a crime or they may realize but they feel it’s excusable because it’s policy, or because otherwise, they may lose their jobs. So here, really, we’re talking about the links between power and crime.\nQ32\nNow, this is one area that much less is generally known about than conventional or traditional crime. It has been relatively ignored by the\nmass media\n– for example, it tends to be under-reported in comparison with conventional crime in news broadcasts, and in crime serials and films and so on – they very rarely deal with corporate crime. And it also tends to be ignored in\nacademic circles\n– there’s been far more research on conventional crime and far more data is available.\nQ33 Q34\nThere are several reasons for this lack of interest in corporate crime, compared with other types of crime. It’s often very complex, whereas with conventional crime it’s usually possible to follow what’s going on without\nspecialist knowledge\n. As well as this, whereas conventional crime usually has a lot of human interest, corporate crime often has much less. The third reason, and possibly the most significant one, is that very often the victims are unaware – they think their misfortune is an accident or that it’s the fault of no-one in particular. They’re\nunaware\nthat they’ve been victims of a crime.\nQ35 Q36\nSo, when we look at the effects of corporate crime we may find it’s very difficult to assess the costs. But these costs can be very considerable in both their economic and social aspects.\nLet’s look at the economic costs first. For example, if a company is producing fruit juice and it dilutes its product so that it’s just a little below the concentration it should be, many millions of people may be paying a small amount extra for their carton of orange juice. Now small amounts like this may seem insignificant for\nindividual customers\n– too small to worry about – but for the company, this deception might result in massive\nillegal profit\n. However, all studies of corporate crime agree that the individuals are in fact deprived of far more money by such crime than they are by conventional crime like robbery and theft.\nQ37 Q38\nIn addition to this, we have to consider the social costs of corporate crime and these are again very difficult to assess, but they are considerable. They’re important because they can undermine the faith of the public in the business world and also, more importantly, because the main group of people they affect are, in fact, not the richer sections of society but the poorer – so here companies are robbing the poor to benefit the rich.\nThere are two more points to do with corporate crime that I’d like to illustrate with reference to a specific event which occurred several years ago. This was an explosion of a large oil tanker which caused the loss of more than fifty lives of the crew. It was an explosion which never should have happened and a subsequent inquiry laid the blame not on anyone who had actually been on the tanker at the time, but on the owners of the tanker. They had deliberately decided not to carry out necessary repair work on the tanker as it was due to be sold, and it was this lack of repair work which was directly responsible for the explosion.\nNow, this illustrates two points to do with corporate crime. First of all, that it does not have to be intentional. The owners of the tanker certainly did not intend it to explode. But very serious consequences can result from people or organizations not considering the possible results of their actions seriously enough. The main crime here was\nindifference to the human results rather than the actual intention to harm anyone. but that didn’t make the results any less tragic\n.\nQ39 & Q40\nAnd this leads me to my second point – that corporate crime can have very severe consequences. It’s not just a matter of companies making bigger profits than they should do, but of events which may affect the lives of innocent people, and yet very often companies, because they say they didn’t intend to harm anyone, can avoid taking responsibility for the results of their actions. And that has been a very dangerous loophole in the law.\nA further example of corporate crime was… (fade out)\n剑4 test 2 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31. C\n32.

Over to you, Jane.\nJANE: Thank you, Geoffrey. This year, the Summer Festival is the biggest we’ve ever seen, so there should be something for everybody. This is the third year they’ve run it and the timing’s slightly different: for the last couple of years it’s been around the fifth to seventeenth, but this year they wanted to allow everyone enough time to recover from the first of January celebrations and they’ve put it\nat the end of the month\n.\nQ11\nThe program has a sensational theatre, dance and also a large number of art exhibitions, but the thing the Festival is most famous for is its great street music.  For today’s report though, Geoffrey, I’m looking at some of the\ntheatrical events\nthat you might like to see; in particular, at this year’s theme – circuses.\nQ12\nI’m going to tell you about two circus performances, but there are\nplenty of others in the program\n. I’ve chosen these because they represent distinct movements within circus performance. The first is the Circus Romano from Italy. As this is a traveling circus, it follows a long tradition by performing\nin a marquee\n– which is really like a canvas portable building, usually put up in a green space or car park, rather than in a theatre or stadium.\nQ13 Q14\nIn spite of this, Circus Romano isn’t at all like the traditional circuses I grew up with. There are no animals -just very talented clowning and acrobatic routines. The show has a lot of very funny moments, especially at the beginning, but the best part is\nthe music and\nlighting\n. They’re magical. At forty-five dollars it’s very expensive anyway – it’s really for\nadult\ntastes. In fact, much of it would be wasted on children – so I suggest you leave them at home.\nQ15 Q16\nThe second circus performance is Circus Electrica at the\nStudio Theatre\n. The purists are suggesting that this isn’t a circus at all. It’s a showcase for skills in dance and magic, rather than the usual ones you expect in a circus. With only six performers it’s a small production, which suits the venue well -the Studio only seats about two hundred people. For my money, it’s the aerial displays which are outstanding as well as the magical tricks – features which are missing from Circus Romano. An interesting feature of the show is that the performers are so young – the youngest is only fourteen. But it’s still well worth seeing: a good one for\nthe whole family\n.\nQ17 Q18\nAnd finally, as it’s summer, you may wish to see some of the Festival performances that are being presented outdoors. Like the famous Mekong Water Puppet Troupe, performing in\nthe City Gardens\nthis week. Now, water puppetry is amazing! It’s large puppets on long sticks, controlled by puppeteers standing waist-deep in the lake. The puppets do comedy routines and there is some terrific formation dancing. This is a fantastic show and the best moment comes at the end – seeing the puppeteers. When the troupe walks up out of the water, you get this amazing feeling. It’s really hard to believe that what you’ve been watching is lifeless wood and cloth. As an adult, I had a great time, but I did note that other older people in the audience weren’t quite as taken with it as I was. It’s a must for\nyoung children\nthough, and that’s the audience it’s really aimed at.\nQ19 Q20\nWell, that’s all I’ve time for today, but I’ll be back next week with more news of what’s worth seeing and what it’s best to miss.\n剑4 test 3 Section 2雅思听力答案\n11.

Er, I’m Dawn Matthews.\nSTUDENT: Yes, hello. I’ve been referred to you because I’m enquiring about the refresher courses that you run. I’d like to find out a bit more about them.\nOFFICER: OK. Well, we run quite a few different short courses for students who are either\nreturning to study\nor studying part-time. Um, tell me about your situation.\nQ21\nSTUDENT: Well, I think that I really need some help in preparing for the coming semester, especially to build up my confidence a bit and help me study effectively because, you see, I’ve been out in the work-force for nearly twelve years now, so it really is a long time since I was last a student.\nOFFICER: Yes, it can seem like a long time, can’t it? Um, well, let me start by telling you what courses we have that might suit you. Are you an undergraduate or a postgraduate? Arts or Sciences?\nSTUDENT: Undergraduate, and I’m in the Business faculty.\nOFFICER: Right then. First of all, there’s our intensive ‘Study for Success’ seminar on\nthe first and second of February\n. It’s aimed at students like you who are uncertain about what to expect at college, and looks at a fairly wide range of approaches to university learning, to motivate you to begin your study and build on your own learning strategies.\nQ22\nSTUDENT: Mm, that sounds good. What are some of the strategies that are presented?\nOFFICER: Well, we try to cover all aspects of the study. Some of the strategies in writing, for example, would be improving your planning for writing, organizing your thinking and building some techniques to help you\nwrite more clearly\n. With reading, there’ll be sessions aimed at getting into the habit of\nanalyzing material\nas you read it, and tips to help you record and remember what you have read. It really is very important to begin reading confidently right from the beginning.\nQ23 Q24\nSTUDENT: Mm.\nOFFICER: There’s also advice on how to get the most from your lectures and practice in giving confident presentations, as well as how to prepare for exams.\nSTUDENT: What about the motivational side of things?\nOFFICER: Ah. Well, there’s a range of motivational exercises that we do to help the students feel\npositive and enthusiastic about their studies\n. The process of learning and exploring a subject can lead to a whole new way of looking at the world, and the study skills and techniques that you build up can be applied in all sorts of different ways.\nQ25\nSTUDENT: Actually, I… I’m very excited about the whole thing of taking up studying again but, you know, I’m a little nervous about whether I’ll manage to get everything done. I suppose it’s the same for all mature students?\nOFFICER: Of course it is. Two of the key components of the course are\ntime management\nand overcoming procrastination. People discover that, once they learn to plan their days, all the work can be accomplished and there’ll still be time for leisure.\nQ26\nSTUDENT: IS there an enrolment fee?\nOFFICER: Well, er, oh, just a minute, let’s see… Ah, the cost is thirty pounds, which includes all course materials and morning tea. You have to arrange your own lunch.\nSTUDENT: That wouldn’t be a problem. I already make sandwiches for my three kids and my wife and myself every day. I won’t have to change my routine.\nOFFICER: No. Now, I need to tell you that this is a very popular course and it’s essential that you\nbook well ahead of time\n. In fact, the Course Convenor tells me that there are only five places left.\nQ27\nSTUDENT: What other courses might be good for me?\nOFFICER: There is one other that you could benefit from. It’s simply called ‘Learning Skills for University Study’ and is\non three consecutive mornings starting on a Monday\n, from nine to twelve, and costs twenty-five pounds. This is aimed at upgrading the study skills most school-leavers have and help them cope with the increased demands of university study. It focuses mainly on making students more responsible for their own success.\nQ28\nSTUDENT: What sort of things are covered in this course?\nOFFICER: Well, basically it’s more advanced thinking, note-taking, reading and writing strategies, but also some input about\nstress management\n.\nQ29\nSTUDENT: I think I’d be better off\nstarting from the basics\nand looking at all the strategies, don’t you?\nQ30\nOFFICER: Yes, from what you’ve told me, I think that’s more in line with your situation.\nSTUDENT: Alright then, um, can I book a place on the ‘Study for Success’ seminar course now?\nOFFICER: Yes. Let me just get out a registration form and take down your details.\n剑4 test 3 Section 3雅思听力答案\n21. A   22. B   23. C   24. A   25. B\n26. A   27. C   28. B   29. B   30. B"

We appreciate that some of our ideas may not be feasible in the circumstances, but we do feel that it is important that the ultimate beneficiaries of the facilities should have some say in its design.\nIf I could start by briefly explaining what steps were taken to find out student opinion and how we have arrived at conclusions. Firstly, a meeting was held in the current Union for our SU Committee to explain the options. Then we invited all students to submit written suggestions for the design, placing cards in a suggestion box. These suggestions then provided the basis for the design of a\nquestionnaire\n,  which was completed by\napproximately two thousand\nof the College students over a period of three weeks. Finally, the SU Committee collated the results and drew up a report. If I can just hand around a copy of that report. This presentation is essentially a summary and discussion of the key points of this report.\nQ31, Q32\nSo, in broad terms, the consensus was as follows. Firstly, regarding the crucial matter of the site, we presented the three options that you have proposed. One: in the city center, near the Faculty of\nEducation\n: two: on the outskirts of the city, near the park, and three: out of town, near the\nhalls of residence\n. We asked students to cite reasons for and against these sites and, and there was remarkable agreement on all three. Site One was unpopular\nbecause of traffic and parking problems\n. Site Two had a number of supporters, mainly because it was close to\nmost lecture rooms\n. And Site Three, out of town, near the halls of residence, was clearly the most popular because of access from living quarters. It was clear that the Union was mainly to be used after lectures. It was also felt that the larger site would allow\nmore room for a choice of facilities\n.\nQ33 Q34 Q35 Q36 Q37\nOur second area of interest was obviously the facilities: there was minimal interest in having a library on the premises, but one option seemed to be a reading room instead -more useful. We would like the current table games room to be replaced with\na small gym\n. And, if possible, a small swimming pool – not, of course, Olympic-sized! There was a large number of respondents in favor of\na travel agent’s\nand insurance center. We also request that there be the offices of the Student Counselling Centre, moving this from the Refectory. There was, however, much disagreement about whether to build a drama theatre. Just over forty percent of the respondents were in favor, but a largish minority were strongly against it, claiming that it is\nelitist and a waste of funds\n. Essentially the jury is out on that.\nQ38 Q39\nFinally, given the number of unfortunate incidents in the current Union over the past few months, a strong point was repeatedly made about security. The recommendations would be at least\nvideo surveillance\nand security personnel who would\ncheck Student Union cards on request\n. We doubt if it would be feasible to have a check at the reception of all people coming in.\nQ40\nWell, this is the summary of the views of the student population. As I say, fuller details are given in our report but I’m happy to take any questions if you have them… (fade out)\n剑4 test 3 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31. questionnaire 问卷调查\n32. approximately 2000 大约2000\n33. education 教育\n34. halls of residence 公寓楼\n35. traffic parking 交通停车场\n36. lecture rooms 演讲室\n37. facilities 设施\n38.

I heard him say he needed a good one.\nQ7\nLISA: The other thing he was saying last week was that his computer printer had broken.\nTONY: Umm. No, I’d be really frightened about getting the wrong type.\nLISA: OK, yeah.\nTONY: The other thing is something for the home – Jill suggested a coffee maker.\nLISA: Oh yeah. I’ll certainly find out what they cost. OK, have you got all that down?\nTONY: Yes.\nLISA: Now we need to think a little more about the money.

What’s this I hear about a big assignment we’ve got to do?\nSUE: Well, basically, we’ve got to find two science experiments to do with a group of eight-year-old children at the local primary school, and we’ve got to complete it by the end of the week.\nMIKE: Oh, that sounds like hard work. Where are we supposed to get the ideas for these experiments from?\nSUE: Well, I managed to get hold of two books from the library.\nMIKE: Oh, well done!\nSUE: How about if we take a look at the experiments in this book first and see if anything looks suitable? I can make notes as we go, about equipment and the purpose of the experiments.\nMIKE: OK, let’s see, um, the first experiment is called ‘Make your own hovercraft’, which sounds very ambitious! Mind you, you only need\ntwenty balloons\nand a table – you don’t need any special engines or anything like that!\nQ21\nSUE: What do you do with it all?\nMIKE: Er, you blow up the balloons and you balance the table on them, upside down of course, and the kids get to ride around on it. You know, the other kids sort of push them around the room. The main purpose is to show how hovercrafts work, and how things hover around on just a cushion of air.\nSUE: OK, that doesn’t sound too bad.\nMIKK: OK, ready for number two?\nSUE: Uh – huh.\nMIKE: Now this one is called ‘Unusual Measures of Lengths’, and you basically use lots of paperclips. The kids go around the class measuring things – you know, how long the desk is, and that sort of thing, um, and then they all compare their answers. Er, and, basically, because not all paperclips are the same lengths, they should come up with some strange answers. It’s supposed to demonstrate the importance of having fixed\nunits of measurement\n.\nQ22\nSUE: Hmm, yes, that’s not bad.\nMIKE: OK, now for number three you need\nrock salt\nor copper sulphate.\nQ23\nSUE: Oh, I’m not sure about that!\nMIKE: Well, just put down the rock salt then, um, apart from that you only need ajar of water. Um, and basically you dissolve lots of salt into the water and watch the crystals form, so it basically teaches the kids about growing\ncrystals\n.\nQ24\nSUE: I suppose it would be nice to grow something. Hmm, let’s move on and have a look at number four.\nMIKE: OK, this one is called ‘Spinning color wheel’. It looks like you get some cardboard and draw a circle on it, divide it into six equal segments and color each one in using different colors, then you thread a\npiece of string\nthrough the middle.\nQ25\nSUE: So we’d need some string as well.\nMIKE: Yes, sorry… um… and you spin the wheel around and if you can get it spinning fast enough, hopefully the colors all merge and show up as white.\nSUE: Oh, I didn’t know that. What’s the principle behind it?\nMIKE: Well it’s pretty elementary physics, really. It teaches them about how\nwhite light or ordinary light\nis made up.\nQ26\nSUE: Hmm, well that doesn’t sound too bad. Now there’s only one more left in this book isn’t there? What does that one say?\nMIKE: Um, well it’s another one where they’d get to make something.\nSUE: Sounds very interesting.\nMIKE: You need quite a lot of equipment actually – a hand drill, an old record, a pin or needle, some paper and a bolt.\nSUE: Hmm, go on, what do they have to do?\nMIKE: Well, they basically make a record player. The main idea is to teach them about recording sound, but hopefully, they’d also see that you need motion and an amplifier to make the sound heard.\nSUE: OK, well it does sound interesting. Shall we go through all of those again and decide if any of them are going to be suitable?\nMIKE: Right, number one. I thought this one sounded nice: there’d be lots of activity and it doesn’t need too much in the way of equipment.\nSUE: Yes, that’s true, but don’t you think it’s\na bit risky\nto get a group of eight-year-olds pushing each other around a classroom like that? Someone could get hurt. No, I don’t like the sound of that one at all!\nQ27\nMIKE: Maybe you’re right.\nSUE: What about number two, with the paperclips? It sounds tame enough.\nMIKE: Yes, a bit too tame if you ask me. I think it needs to be something\na bit more active and interesting\nthan that, don’t you?\nQ28\nSUE: Yes, I suppose you’re right. We won’t get a very good mark if the children don’t actually enjoy the experiments, and I suppose we could turn them off science for good! Well, what about the next one, number three?\nMIKE: Now, I quite like the idea of this one.\nSUE: Yes, so do I, but I seem to remember when we did it at high school we\nhad to wait up to a fortnight\nbefore we saw any halfway decent results.\nQ29\nMIKE: Oh, yes well, that won’t be any good then. We’ll only see the kids for one or two hours at the most.\nSUE: Yes, and we have to do the experiments and write up our results within a week, so that one won’t do at all.\nMIKE: OK, well, what did you think of number four?\nSUE: I like the idea of it, but do you think it will be a bit elementary for them?\nMIKE: Well they are only eight you know!\nSUE: I know, but you know what I mean. Don’t you think the activity itself is a bit babyish?\nMIKE: Hmm, maybe you’re right.\nSUE: They might have fun but, I mean, cutting out a circle and coloring it in?\nMIKE: OK, well, what about number five?\nSUE: I thought this one sounded a bit too good to be true – great equipment!\nMIKE: Yeah.\nSUE: But don’t you think it’s\na bit ambitious\nfor this age group? I mean, I don’t want to start off something and then have to abandon it if they just can’t cope with it. I could see us ending up doing just about all of the work for them.\nQ30\nMIKE: I guess you’re right. Oh well, maybe we could store that idea away for later.\nSUE: Yep, let’s hope this second book has something better!\n剑4 test 4 Section 3雅思听力答案\n21. 20 balloons\n22. units of measurement/measurements/measurement units\n23. rock salt/salt\n24. crystals\n25. strings/piece of string\n26.

As you know, sharks have a reputation for being very dangerous creatures capable of injuring or killing humans, and I’d like to talk about sharks in Australia.\nSharks are rather large fish, often growing to over ten metres and the longest sharks caught in Australia have reached sixteen metres. Sharks vary in weight with size and breed, of course, but the heaviest shark caught in Australia was a White Pointer – that,  weighed\nseven hundred and ninety-five\nkilograms – quite a size! Sharks have a different structure to most fish: instead of a skeleton made of bone, they have a tough elastic skeleton of cartilage. Unlike bone, this firm, pliable material is rather like your nose, and allows the shark to bend easily as it swims. The shark’s skin isn’t covered with scales, like other fish: instead the skin’s covered with barbs, giving it a rough texture like sandpaper. As you know, sharks are very quick swimmers. This is made possible by their fins, one set at the side and another set underneath the body, and the\ntail\nalso helps the shark move forward quickly.\nQ31 Q32\nUnlike other fish, sharks have to keep swimming if they want to stay at a particular depth, and they rarely swim at the surface. Mostly, they swim at the bottom of the ocean, scavenging and picking up food that’s lying on the ocean\nfloor\nWhile most other animals, including fish, hunt their prey by means of their eyesight, sharks hunt essentially by smell. They have a very acute\nsense of smell\n– and can sense the presence of food long before they can see it.\nQ33 Q34\nIn Australia, where people spend a lot of time at the beach, the government has realised that it must prevent sharks from swimming near its beaches. As a result, they’ve introduced a beach-netting program. Beach-netting, or meshing, involves\nsetting large nets parallel to the shore\n; this means that the nets on New South Wales beaches are set on one day, and then lifted and taken out to sea on the next day. When shark-netting first began in 1939, only the Sydney metropolitan beaches were meshed – these beaches were chosen because beaches near the city are usually the most crowded with swimmers. Ten years later, in 1949, systematic meshing was extended to include the beaches to the south of Sydney. As a result of the general success of the program in Sydney, shark-meshing was introduced to the state of Queensland around 1970. The New Zealand authorities also looked at it, but considered meshing uneconomical – as did Tahiti in the Pacific. At around the same time,\nSouth Africa\nintroduced meshing to some of its most popular swimming beaches.\nQ35 Q36\nWhen meshing began, approximately fifteen hundred sharks were caught in the first year. However, this declined in the years that followed, and since that time, the average annual catch has been only about\na hundred and fifty\na year. The majority of sharks are caught\nduring the warmest months, from November to February\n, when sharks are most active and when both the air and the ocean are at their maximum temperature.\nQ37 Q38\nDespite quite large catches, some people believe that shark meshing is not the best way to catch sharks. It’s not that they think sharks are afraid of nets, or because they eat holes in them, because neither of these is true. But meshing does appear to be less effective than some other methods, especially when there are big seas with\nhigh rolling waves and strong currents\nand anything that lets\nthe sand move\n– the sand that’s holding the nets down. When this moves the nets will also become less effective.\nQ39 Q40\n剑4 test 4 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31. 795\n32. tail 尾巴\n33. floor 地面\n34. sense of smell 嗅觉\n35. A\n36. A\n37. B\n38. B\n39-40. BE"

How can I help you?\nCUSTOMER: Oh hello. I’m interested in the holidays you offer along the coast near here.\nRECEPTIONIST: Yes. We operate several tours up the coast. Where in particular did you want to go?\nCUSTOMER: Well, I like the sound of the holiday that mentioned whales. Was it ‘Whale Watching’?\nRECEPTIONIST: Oh, that’s our\nWhale Watch\nExperience. It’s very popular and it’s based in a lovely little town with nice beaches.\nExample\nCUSTOMER: Oh right, and how long does it last?\nRECEPTIONIST: It’s two days – that includes four hours’ travel time each way from here.\nCUSTOMER: Good, I don’t want to be away any longer than that. So is that by coach?\nRECEPTIONIST: Actually it’s\nby minibus\n. We like to keep those tours small and personal so we don’t take a whole coachload of people. In fact, we only take up to\nfifteen people\non this tour, although we do run it with just twelve or thirteen.\nQ1, Q2\nCUSTOMER: Oh, right. So do you run these tours often?\nRECEPTIONIST: Well it depends on the time of year. Of course, in peak times like the summer holidays, we do them every weekend, but at the moment it’s usually once a month at most.\nCUSTOMER: And when is the next one going?\nRECEPTIONIST: Mmm, let me see. Um, there’s one in three weeks’ time which is\nApril the 18th\n, and then we don’t have another one until June the 2nd.\nQ3\nCUSTOMER: All right, and is April a good time to go?\nRECEPTIONIST: Pretty good. Though the really good time is later in the year. I have to say though that the whale sighting is only one of the many things offered.\nCUSTOMER: Really?\nRECEPTIONIST: Yes. The hotel itself where you stay has great facilities. It’s called The Pallisades.\nCUSTOMER: The Paris what?\nRECEPTIONIST: No, it’s actually The Pallisades,\nP-A-L-L-I-S-A-D-E-S\n. It’s right on the main beach there.\nQ4\nCUSTOMER: Oh, I see.\nRECEPTIONIST: All of the rooms have nice views and the food is really good there too.\nCUSTOMER: Oh right.\nCUSTOMER: And what about the other things? You know, that are included in the price.\nRECEPTIONIST: Oh, there are lots of things. If you don’t want to do the whale watch cruise, your guide will take anyone who is interested either on\na bushwalk through the national park near the hotel, and there’s no extra charge for that\n, or on a fishing trip. That’s an extra $12 I think. And there’s also a reptile park in town – that costs more or less the same.\nQ5/Q6\nCUSTOMER: No, I think I’d prefer whales to snakes.\nRECEPTIONIST: Yeah. And if you just want to relax you are free to sit by the hotel pool or go down the beach. Oh, and they also have tennis courts at the hotel, but you have to pay for those by the hour. But\nthere are\ntable tennis tables downstairs and they’re part of the accommodation package.\nJust speak to your guide.\nQ5/Q6\nCUSTOMER: Well that sounds good. So how much is the basic tour price?\nRECEPTIONIST: At this time of year it’s usually around $300 but let me check. Er… oh, it’s actually\n$\n280\n.\nQ7\nCUSTOMER: And the next tour, are there any places on that one?\nRECEPTIONIST: How many people is it for?\nCUSTOMER: There are two of us.\nRECEPTIONIST: Yes, that should be fine. Can I just mention that we require all bookings to be made at least\nfourteen days\nbefore you travel to avoid cancellations of tours. And if you cancel within seven days of departure you will have to pay 50% of your total booking.\nQ8\nCUSTOMER: OK.\nRECEPTIONIST: And you also need to pay a\n20%\ndeposit at the time of booking.\nQ9\nCUSTOMER: Can I pay that by credit card?\nRECEPTIONIST: Yes, you can.\nCUSTOMER: All right, what I’ll do is I’ll talk to my partner and get back to you.\nRECEPTIONIST: Fine. So I’ll make a provisional booking, shall I? – two for the Whale Watch Experience. Let me issue you with a customer reference number for when you call back. Do you have a pen?\nCUSTOMER: Yes.\nRECEPTIONIST: OK, it’s\nthree nine seven, four five, T\n. That’s T for tango. When you call back, ask to speak to the Tour Manager, that’s me, Tracy.    Q10\nCUSTOMER: Fine, I will.\n剑5 test 1 Section 1雅思听力答案\n1. (by) minibus\n2. 15 (people)\n3. April 18th\n4. Pallisades\n5-6.

Now, in today’s show we’re looking at beds for children and babies. Let’s start by looking at baby cots, that’s for children of up to three years old. We tested three different cots all in the budget price range and, as usual, we will feature the good points, the problems and our verdict.\nThe first cot we looked at was by Baby Safe and it had several good points to recommend it. Our testers liked the fact that it had four wheels, so it was easy to\nmove around\n. The only slight problems with this cot were that it had no\nbrakes\n, but they didn’t think that mattered too much. At first, they were a bit concerned about the sidebar, because they felt babies could trap their\nfingers\nin it, but our testers felt that this was unlikely to happen so they have given this one a verdict of ‘\nsatisfactory\n’.\nQ11, Q12, Q13, Q14\nThe next cot was by Choice Cots and this time our testers were pleased to find a cot which is simple to\nput together\n– unlike others we looked at. On the minus side, our testers did not like the fact that the side of the cot did not drop down, making it difficult to pick up newborn babies. However, the real problem with this cot was the space between the bars; our testers found they were\ntoo wide\nand a baby could easily trap his head. We felt this was a real safety hazard and so we have labeled this one\ndangerous\n, I’m afraid.\nQ15, Q16, Q17\nAnd finally better news for the Mother’s Choice cot. This cot was slightly different in that, although the sidebar did not drop down, the base could be raised or lowered into two different positions making it safe as well as convenient. The negatives for this one were quite minor; the only niggle everyone had was the fact that it has no\nwheels\nand the only other problem anyone could find, was that there were pictures which were simply stuck on and so could easily become detached. The makers have now promised to discontinue this practice. As this cot will then be safe in every way, we have made the Mother’s Choice cot our\nbest buy\n. Congratulations Mother’s Choice!\nQ18, Q19\nSo, what features should you look for in a baby’s cot? Well, obviously safety is a very important factor as well as comfort and convenience. We recommend that, if you are buying a cot, do make sure that any metal present is not rusted or bent in any way. You should ensure your cot has only rounded or smooth edging without any\nsharp\nedges, this is especially important for wooden cots.\nQ20\nAnd now on to beds for toddlers …\n剑5 test 1 Section 2雅思听力答案\n11. move around\n12. brakes\n13. fingers\n14. satisfactory\n15. put together\n16. too wide\n17. dangerous\n18. wheels\n19. best/best buy/safe\n20. sharp"

Hi, my name is Monica.\nANDREW: Nice to meet you. My name is Andrew, Andrew Harris.\nMONICA: So, Andrew, have you seen our diploma course prospectus yet?\nANDREW: Yes, I’ve already looked at it. In fact, I thought the information on course content was really useful, but I’m afraid I’m a bit confused by all the different ways you can do the course: full-time intensive, part-time and so on.\nMONICA: Well, let’s see if I can help. I think each course type has its advantages and disadvantages, so it really depends on you – your own study habits, and your financial circumstances, of course. Are you working at the moment?\nANDREW: Yes. I’ve been working in the administration section of the local hospital for the last\nthree years\n. And before that I worked in the office of a computer engineering company for two years. So, I’ve got about five years of relevant work experience. And what I’m hoping to focus on is Personnel Management.\nQ21\nMONICA: I see. And are you planning to leave your current job to study, or are you thinking about just taking a year off?\nANDREW: I want to know what my options are, really. I don’t want to quit my job or anything and my employers are keen for me to get some more qualifications but obviously, it would be better if I could do a course without taking too much time away from work.\nMONICA: Right, so you don’t really want to do the full-time course, then?\nANDREW: No, not really. It’s also a question of finances. You see, my office has agreed to pay\nthe cost of the course itself\n, but I would have to take unpaid leave if I want to study full-time and, well, I don’t think I could afford to support myself with no salary for a whole year.\nQ22\nMONICA: OK. Well, you have two other possibilities: you could either do the part-time course – that would be over\ntwo years\nand you wouldn’t have to take any time off work – or you could do what we call a ‘modular’ course. You could do that in eighteen months if you wanted – or longer, it’s quite flexible and it would be up to you.\nQ23\nANDREW: Mmm. So what does the part-time course involve?\nMONICA: For that you would join an evening class and have a lecture twice a week. Then, you’d have to attend a seminar or discussion workshop one weekend a month.\nANDREW: What kind of coursework would I have to do?\nMONICA: Well, it’s a mixture. You’d be expected to write\nan essay\neach month, which counts towards your final assessment. You have a case study to do by the end of the course, which might involve doing a survey or something like that, and also you need to hand in\na short report\nevery four weeks.\nQ24/Q25\nANDREW: So, that’s quite a lot of work, then, on top of working every day. It sounds like a lot of studying – and really tiring.\nMONICA: Yes, you certainly wouldn’t have much free time!\nANDREW: What about the ‘modular’ course? What would I have to do for that?\nMONICA: That’s where you get the opportunity to study\nfull-time\nfor short periods. That way you can cover a lot of coursework and attend lectures and seminars during the day. And each module lasts for\none term\n, say, about twelve weeks at a time. There are obvious advantages in this – the main one being that you can study in a much more\nintensive\nway, which suits some people much better.\nQ26, Q27, Q28\nANDREW: And how many of these ‘modules’ would I have to do to get the diploma?\nMONICA: The current programme is\ntwo modules\n– and then you have to choose\na topic\nto work in more depth – but you can base that on your job, and so you don’t need to be away from the office, and how long it takes is up to you. The important thing is that you don’t have to study and work. You can focus on one thing at a time.\nQ29, Q30\nANDREW: Yes, I can see that. It certainly sounds attractive! It would be more expensive, though. I mean, I’d have to support myself without pay for each module.\nMONICA: That’s true, so that might be a problem for you. Look, why don’t you talk this over with your employers and …\n剑5 test 1 Section 3雅思听力答案\n21. B\n22. A\n23. C\n24-25.

One aspect that we haven’t yet considered is gender. So if we consider gender issues we’re basically asking whether men and women have different attitudes towards saving money, and whether they save money for different things.\nBack in 1928 the British writer George Bernard Shaw wrote in his Intelligent Women’s Guide to Socialism and Capitalism that ‘A man is supposed to understand\npolitics\n, economics, and finance and is, therefore, unwilling to accept essential instruction.’ He also said, ‘A woman, having fewer pretensions, is far more willing to\nlearn\n’. Now, though these days people might question a lot of the assumptions contained in those statements, recent research does suggest that there are some quite fundamental differences between men and women in their attitudes to economic matters.\nQ31, Q32\nLet’s look at what men and women actually save for. Research studies of women in North America have found that women are far more likely to save for\ntheir children’s education\nand they are also more likely to save up in order to buy a house one day. The same studies have found that men, on the other hand, tend to save for\na car\n, which by the way takes a surprisingly large amount of the household budget in North America. But the other main priority for men when saving money is their retirement. When they’re earning, they’re far more likely to put money aside for their old age than women are.\nQ33, Q34\nNow, this is rather disturbing because in fact, the need for women to save for their old age is far greater than for men. Let’s consider this for a moment. To start with, it is a fact that throughout the world, women are likely to live many years longer than men, so they need money to support them during this time. Since women are likely to be the ones left without a partner in old age, they may, therefore, have to pay for\nnursing care\n, because they don’t have a spouse to look after them. Furthermore, the high divorce rates in North America are creating a poverty cycle for women. It is the divorced women who will most often have to look after the children and thus they need more money to look after not just themselves but others.\nQ35\nSo what can be done about this situation? The population in North America is likely to contain an increasing number of elderly women. The research indicates that at present for women it takes a\ncrisis\nto make them think about their future financial situation.    Q36\nBut of course, this is the very worst time for anyone to make important decisions. Women today need to look ahead, think ahead – not wait until they’re under pressure. Even women in their\nearly twenties\nneed to think about pensions, for example, and with increasing numbers of women in professional positions, there are signs that this is beginning to happen. Then research also suggests that women avoid dealing effectively with their economic situation because of a lack of\nconfidence\n. The best way for them to overcome this is by getting themselves properly informed so they are less dependent on other people’s advice. A number of initiatives have been set up to help them do this. This College, for example, is one of the educational institutions which offers night classes in\nMoney Management\n, and increasing numbers of women are enrolling in such courses. Here, they can be given advice on different ways of saving. Many women are unwilling to invest in stocks and shares, for instance, but these can be extremely profitable. It is usually advised that at least 70% of a person’s savings should be in\nlow-risk investments\nbut for the rest, financial advisors often advise taking some well-informed risks. Initiatives such as this can give women the economic skills and knowledge they need for a comfortable, independent retirement.\nQ37, Q38, Q39, Q40\nThe increasing proportion of elderly women in the population is likely to have other economic consequences …\n剑5 test 1 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31. politics 政治\n32. learn 学习\n33. children’s education 儿童教育\n34. a car 一辆车\n35. nursing care 护理\n36. crisis 危机\n37. early twenties 20年代初期\n38. confidence 自信心\n39. money management 财务管理\n40. low-risk investment 低风险投资"

How can I help you?\nMAN: I was wondering if it was possible to join the library.\nLIBRARIAN: Are you a student at North College?\nMAN: No, I’m not, but someone told me it was possible to join, even if I wasn’t.\nLIBRARIAN: That’s right, it is. Are you over\n18\n? That’s our minimum joining age.\nExample\nMAN: Yes, I am.\nLIBRARIAN: That’s no problem then.\nMAN: Could you tell me what I have to do to join?\nLIBRARIAN: Well, you’ll need to come into the library and fill out some forms. You’ll also need to bring two\npassport photos\nwith you. We also need two documents for ID, so a driving license would be fine.\nQ1\nMAN: I’ve got that and what else? A credit card?\nLIBRARIAN: No, it needs to have your address on it.\nMAN: Shall I bring\na bank statement\n, would that do?\nQ2\nLIBRARIAN: That’ll be fine.\nMAN: Good. Does it cost anything to join?\nLIBRARIAN: Well, it’s free for students here but otherwise it’s\n￡125\nper year or ￡25 if you’ve got a current student card from another college.\nQ3\nMAN: I was at Westerley College until last year but now I’ve got a job at Jefferson’s steel factory. Er, it’s more expensive than I thought. My local library is free.\nLIBRARIAN: But you’ll find they don’t have the range of reference books or facilities which we buy for our students. That’s why you have to pay to be an external member.\nMAN: I see. How many books can I borrow?\nLIBRARIAN: We allow twelve items borrowed at any one time if you’re a student, and that includes CDs, DVDs and videos. However, it’s only\neight\nitems for members of the public.\nQ4\nMAN: Fine. And how long can I have them for?\nLIBRARIAN: Well, you can have both fiction and reference books for four weeks which isn’t bad really.\nMAN: And what happens if I return them late?\nLIBRARIAN: Like all libraries there’s a fine system in place. The minimum fine is\n￡1.50\nbut it can be much higher for some items – up to ￡5 per week. We’ll give you a booklet with all the details when you join. You can always renew items if they’re not required by anyone else by telephoning or logging on to our website.\nQ5\nMAN: What about the computers? Can I use them free of charge?\nLIBRARIAN: For college students it’s free, but for external members like yourself, the first hour is free and then we make a nominal charge of ￡1 per hour thereafter.\nMAN: Do I have to book in advance for them?\nLIBRARIAN: Oh, yes, it’s advisable. Most people tend to book twenty-four hours in advance although sometimes you can get one with only six hours’ notice. However, the earliest you can book a computer is\nforty-eight\nhours before you need it, and you can only book one hour at a time. If no-one else has booked the computer out, then you may be able to have another hour if you want. We have a wide range of databases, so the computers are in great demand.\nQ6\nMAN: I’m thinking of doing some writing and I might need to access national newspapers. Do you have them on these databases?\nLIBRARIAN: We do indeed. We’ve got all the big nationals, The Guardian and The Observer, The Independent and The Times and Sunday Times. We’ve also got all the\nlocal papers\nand a wide selection of magazines.\nQ7\nMAN: Excellent. I assume you have photocopying facilities?\nLIBRARIAN: Of course. 5p a sheet for both A4 and A3 black-and-white copies and 40p a sheet for colour. You can get\na card\nfrom the counter here – it doesn’t take coins.\nQ8\nMAN: OK. Oh by the way, another thing I was wondering about was if you ran any writing classes through the library?\nLIBRARIAN: We do, but you’ll have to speak to John Grantingham about that. He’s our resident author. He runs the creative writing classes.\nMAN: John… Grant…. Could you spell that for me please?\nLIBRARIAN: Certainly.\nG – R – A – N – T – I – N – G – H – A – M\n.\nQ9\nMAN: Are the classes here at the library?\nMAN: Yes – he’s here on Thursday evenings, oh no sorry,\nFriday\n– he’s just changed it. You can contact him by emailing the library.\nLIBRARIAN: Okay. Right, well that’s about all I need to know. Thank you. I’ll be along later this week to join. Thanks.

I’ll be giving our contact details at the end, if anyone would like to find out more about how to support us.\nBut first, how the charity began. I got the idea of exporting bicycles to developing countries while I was in Ecuador. I went there in 1993 just after graduating from university. After three years of studying, I wanted adventure. I loved travelling, so\nI decided to join a voluntary organisation\nand was sent to Ecuador to carry out land surveys. The project came to an end after five years and when I returned to the UK in 1998, I started planning Pedal Power.\nQ11\nWhere I lived in Ecuador was a very rural area. My neighbour had the only bicycle in the village, whereas everyone else walked everywhere. My neighbour’s business was unusually successful, and for years I couldn’t understand why. Then I realised\nhaving a bike meant he could get where he wanted to go without much trouble\n. Other local carpenters could only accept jobs in a three-kilometre radius, so no matter how skilled they were, they could never do as many jobs as my neighbour.\nQ12\nAt Pedal Power, we collect second-hand bikes in the UK and send them to some of the poorest regions in the world. When we distribute bikes overseas we don’t give them away for free. We’d like to, but long term that doesn’t really help the local economy. The demand for bikes is enormous, which makes them very expensive locally. So we sell them for 5% of the normal price.\nBut in order to continue operating we need to have a constant supply of bikes which we send out every six months.\nQ13\nOne example of a town that’s received bicycles from Pedal Power is Rivas. It was the first place I sent a full container of bicycles to. Most people there now own a bicycle.\nThe local economy has developed so much, you wouldn’t recognise it as the same place\n. In fact, there are more bikes than on the streets of Amsterdam, if you’ve ever been there.\nQ14\nBut Pedal Power still needs your help. You may have read about some of our recent problems in the British media. In August 2000, we simply ran out of money. We had containers of bikes ready to send, but\nno money to pay the bills\n. It was a terrible situation. We managed to ensure the bikes went out on time, but the other problems carried on for several months.\nQ15\nFortunately in October 2001 we won an Enterprise Award which helped us enormously. We invested fifteen of the\nseventy-five-thousand-pound\nprize money to help secure our future. Winning the award helped raise our profile, and the money enabled us to pay all our shipping costs, which represent our greatest expense. Pedal Power changes lives – when someone gets a bicycle from us, they see a 14% increase in their income. We’re currently looking to invest in\ncomputers\nso that our office staff can do an even better job. Because of our work, people in a number of countries now have a better standard of living – so far we’ve provided 46,000 people with bikes. But we’d like to send more, at least 50,000 by the end of the year.\nQ16, Q17\nNow there are many ways in which you can support the work of Pedal Power, not just by taking a bike to a collection in your area. I should also like to say if you do have a bike to donate, it doesn’t matter what condition it’s in – if we can’t repair it, we’ll strip it down for spare parts. Of course, to do that\nwe always need tools\n, which are expensive to buy, so we welcome any that you can give. Also, you could help by contacting the voluntary staff at our offices, they’ll be able to suggest\nactivities you could organise to bring in funds for us\n. People do all kinds of things – including, of course, sponsored bike rides. Also,\nwe’re always interested to hear of other places that would benefit from receiving a consignment of bikes\n, and welcome suggestions from people who’ve been to developing regions on their travels. We hope that by talking on radio programmes like this, we will be able to raise public awareness, which will lead to government organisations also giving us regular financial support, something that we really need.\nQ18/19/20\nIf you’d like some more information about where to donate an old bicycle or offer help in other ways please contact us on …\n剑5 test 2 Section 2雅思听力答案\n11.

You did really well, and I hope that you got a lot out of it. I’d like to use this tutorial as a feedback session, where you reflect on the experience of doing the project. So Cristina, I was wondering, what did you enjoy most about making the video?\nCRISTINA: I liked using the camera.\nTUTOR: Is it the first time you’ve operated one like that?\nCRISTINA: Yes, it is.\nTUTOR: Well the results were very good! Anything else?\nCRISTINA: I also enjoyed visiting one of the British students we filmed. I’d never been inside a British\nhome\nbefore.\nQ21\nTUTOR: OK Cristina, thanks. What about you, Ibrahim? What did you enjoy?\nIBRAHIM: Well for me it was a very good chance to get to know students who are on other courses, because everyone in our group is studying English, and we don’t usually have much to do with the rest of the college.\nTUTOR: Yes, good. Do you think you’ll maintain the contact now?\nIBRAHIM: I hope so. I’ve invited three of them to\nhave dinner\nwith me next week.\nQ22\nTUTOR: Great! If you haven’t decided what to make yet I can tell you they’ll love trying Arab dishes. And of course, it’s good for your English too. Cristina, what did you find? What was the most useful aspect of the project from the point of view of the English practice?\nCRISTINA: I think, when we were being shown how to edit the film, we had to follow the instructions. And that was very good practice for me. And I also learned some\ntechnical\nwords that I hadn’t heard before.\nQ23\nTUTOR: What about you Ibrahim? What was the most useful for your English?\nIBRAHIM: It was listening to the British students, because they don’t speak as slowly as most of the tutors on our course. I think they speak at natural speed, so it forces me to get used to it. And they use a lot of\nslang\n.\nQ24\nTUTOR: So you learned some new words which will be useful?\nIBRAHIM: Yes.\nTUTOR: Good. I’m glad it helped. Well, we’ve talked a little bit about enjoyment, and about language practice. Were there any other benefits? What else did you feel you’d learnt from the project? Was it useful in other ways?\nCRISTINA: Yes, well firstly, I learned how to use a video camera. And also, I think I really learned a lot about working together with other people. I’ve never done anything with a group before, and we had to find ways of\ncooperating\n, erm, and compromising, and sometimes\npersuading\npeople, when they don’t agree with you.\nQ25, Q26\nTUTOR: Yes, that is a very useful experience, I know.\nTUTOR: What about you, Ibrahim?\nIBRAHIM: Well, I think I learnt a lot about how important\nediting\nis. When you’re filming you think that everything’s going to be interesting, but in fact we cut around half of it in the end, and then it was much better.\nQ27\nTUTOR: Good. Well, one last thing I’d like to ask. What mistakes do you think you, as a group that is, made? I mean, to put it another way, if you had to do it all over again, is there anything you’d do differently?\nCRISTINA: We didn’t plan very well. For example, we didn’t decide on dates when we’d\ncomplete\neach separate step of the project, and we should have agreed about that in the beginning, because we were always late with everything!\nQ28\nTUTOR: Right. Anything else?\nCRISTINA: I think we should have tried to\nexperiment\nmore with the camera.

I’d never been inside a British\nhome\nbefore.\n解析：这道题因为先提到了British students，所以很容易将students当作答案。但它的错误有两点。其一，根据题干中的going to，可以判断答案应该是个地点，students填上去语义不符。其二，题干中British前面有冠词a，表示答案应该是单数，这点students也不符合。因此我们继续往后听，最终判断答案为home\n第22题答案：(have) dinner/come to dinner/go to dinner\n对应原文： I’ve invited three of them to\nhave dinner\nwith me next week\n解析：这道题的难点主要在于跟21题距离太远，很容易让人在心急之前随便选个动词填上去。但只要守好with him这一点，或者能识别ask与invite的同义替换，还是比较容易确定答案的。\n第23题答案：technical\n对应原文：And I also learned some\ntechnical\nwords that I hadn’t heard before.\n解析：听到同一单元格内instructions，意识到答案即将出现。vocabulary在录文章来自老烤鸭雅思音中被替换成words，根据修饰关系确定technical为答案。\n第24题答案：slang\n对应原文：And they use a lot of\nslang\n.\n解析：录音中a lot of与large amount of的替换很好识别，难点主要在于slang（俚语，俗语）的拼写上。\n第25题答案：cooperating/cooperation\n对应原文：I’ve never done anything with a group before, and we had to find ways of\ncooperating\n解析：听到同一单元格内上面的working with other people意识到答案即将到来。虽然learn about与find ways of的对应有些勉强，但cooperating说的时候有明显重音，还是比较好识别的。\n第26题答案：persuading\n对应原文：and sometimes\npersuading\npeople, when they don’t agree with you.\n解析：空后的people原词出现，而且答案与前面的compromising构成并列结构，还是比较好确定答案的。但因为上一道题cooperating拼写较长，可能会出现漏掉的情况。\n第27题答案：editing\n对应原文：Well, I think I learnt a lot about how important\nediting\nis\n解析：锁定答案不难，但这道题出现了多种语音现象。首先是important的t浊化，发/d/的音，而后/d/与editing的/e/连读，同时editing的i弱读变成了/ə/，所以哪怕听到了也不太好识别。\n第28题答案：complete\n对应原文：we didn’t decide on dates when we’d\ncomplete\neach separate step of the project\n解析：这句话读的比较有节奏感，不少同学听到dates重读就匆忙写上去当成答案。但它一不是动词，二不能跟each stage搭配，所以得排除。each原词出现，stage与step同义替换，根据修饰关系确定complete是答案。\n第29题答案：experiment\n对应原文： I think we should have tried to\nexperiment\nmore with the camera.\n解析：with the camera原词出现，根据这一点很容易确定答案为experiment\n第30题答案：long\n对应原文：we tried to do too much, to make a\nlong\nfilm\n解析：虽然much前也有too，但它并不能修饰film，因此排除，选择后面的long作为答案。"

For early explorers, it was the ultimate survival contest; for researchers like me, it remains a place of great intellectual challenge; while for the modern tourist, it’s simply a wilderness of great beauty.\nFirst, some facts and figures. Antarctica is a place of extremes – the highest, coldest and windiest continent and over\nfifty-eight\ntimes the size of the UK. The ice-cap contains almost 70% of the world’s fresh water and 90% of its ice, but with very low snowfall, most of the continent technically falls unbelievably into the category of ‘\ndesert\n’! Huge icebergs break off the continent each year, while in winter half the surrounding ocean freezes over, which means its size almost doubles.\nQ31, Q32\nResearch and exploration has been going on in Antarctica for more than two hundred years, and has involved scientists from many different countries, who work together on research stations. Here\nscience\nand technical support have been integrated in a very cost-effective way – our Antarctic research programme has several summers-only stations and two all-year-round ones; I was based on one of the all-year-round ones.\nQ33\nThe research stations are really self-contained communities of about twenty people. There’s living and working space, a kitchen with a huge food store, a\nsmall hospital\nand a well-equipped gym to ensure everyone keeps fit in their spare time. The station generates its own electricity and communicates with the outside world using a satellite link.\nQ34\nOur station – Zero One – had some special features. It wasn’t built on land but on an ice-shelf, hundreds of metres thick. Supplies were brought to us on large sledges from a\nship\nfifteen kilometres away at the ice edge.\nQ35\nLiving in the Antarctic hasn’t always been so comfortable. Snow build-ups caused enormous problems for four previous stations on the same site, which were buried and finally crushed by the weight. Fortunately no-one was hurt, but these buildings became a huge challenge to architects who finally came up with a remarkable solution – the buildings are placed on\nplatforms\nwhich can be raised above the changing snow level on legs which are extendable.\nQ36\nFood is one of the most important aspects of survival in a polar climate. People living there need to obtain a lot more energy from their food, both to keep warm and to undertake heavy physical work. . Maybe you know that an adult in the UK will probably need about 1,700 kilocalories a day on average; someone in Antarctica will need about\n3,500\n-just over double! This energy is provided by foods which are high in carbohydrate and fat.\nQ37\nRations for fieldwork present an additional problem. They need to provide maximum energy, but they must also be compact and light for easy transport. Special boxes are prepared, each containing enough food for one person for twenty days. You may be familiar with coffee processed by freeze-drying, which preserves the quality of the food product while making a large saving in weight – well, this type of presentation is ideal in our situation. It wasn’t available to earlier polar explorers, whose diet was commonly insufficient for their health.\nI think that being at the cutting edge of science has a special appeal for everyone working in Antarctica, in whatever capacity. As a marine biologist, my own research was fascinating; but it’s perhaps climate change research that is the most crucial field of study.\nWithin this general field, surveying changes in the volume and stability of the ice-cap is vital, since these may have profound effects on world sea levels and on\nocean currents\n. A second important area is monitoring the size of the hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica, since this is an indicator of global ultra-violet radiation levels. Thirdly, bubbles in the ice-sheet itself provide an index of\npollution\nbecause frozen inside them are samples of previous atmospheres over the past 500,000 years, and these provide us with evidence for the effects of such human activities as agriculture and industry.\nQ38, Q39\nThere are an increasing number of opportunities for\nyoung\npeople to work for a period in Antarctica – not only as research assistants in projects like mine, but also in a wide range of junior administrative and technical positions including vacancies for map-makers. I hope that the insights I’ve provided will encourage you to take up these opportunities in this fascinating continent.\nQ40\n剑5 test 2 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31. 58\n32. desert\n33. science\n34.

I’d like a bit more power this time … a\n1.4\nshould do, I don’t think I need a 1.6 or anything.\n解析：这道题先说了1.2，然后是1.4，最后又说了1.6。前者是她现在车的排量，后者则有否定。不过1.6处的don’t读的很轻，不太容易识别。大家要逐渐习惯这种发音方式。除此之外，如果大家写答案的时候没有写liters也不用担心，现在考试这种单位一般都会直接给出来。\n第2题答案：automatic\n对应原文： I’d want\nautomatic\n– I’ve never driven a car with manual gears\n解析：这道题的出题方式跟上一道题目有些类似，都是先说正确答案之后又否定了错误答案。此外，大家要记着automatic（自动挡）和manual（手动挡）这两个单词，它们在购车场景中几乎必然出现。\n第3题答案：light/sky\n对应原文：But actually, I think I prefer this lighter shade here – ‘\nSky\n’\n解析：女性先以疑问语气说了royal，后面跟了转折，再然后才是答案sky。所以大家在Section 1中听到疑问语气之后要小心一下，以防后面更正。\n第4题答案：credit\n对应原文：I’d like\ncredit\nprovided the terms are reasonable.\n解析：男性在上句话结束时提到了credit和cash两种方式。女性选择了credit。题目难度本身不大，只要有耐心等待男性说完话就行。\n第5题答案：Harries\n对应原文：Wendy Harries, that’s\nH-A-double R-I-E-S\n解析：这道题的难点主要在double和r的连读，发出了la的音。不过我们可以根据女性前面关于harries的整体读音进行辅助判断。\n第6题答案：Dr/Doctor\n对应原文：It’s\nDoctor\n, actually.\n解析：题目本身不难。主要是跟上道题离的太近了。只要稍微思考la是什么字母，基本上就会错过。\n第7题答案：Alton\n对应原文：Men: Is that\nO-L-T-O-N\n?-WOMAN: Not quite, it begins with an\nA\n, not an O.\n解析：不少同学会把中间的L听成O。这点一方面是听音辨音能力较弱的问题，另一方面也有L的尾音元音化的问题。大家听得时候可以将重点放在L发音转弯的那一下。\n第8题答案：messages\n对应原文：I can give you a number just for\nmessages\n解析：题目难点在于女性的回答偏长。在考试紧张的情况下，很容易因为担心错过题目而从前面随便选个单词作为答案。只要有耐心等待，一般都没有什么问题。\n第9题答案：Lion\n对应原文：I think it’s 1996, and it’s called a\nLion\n解析：这道题有个小技巧。在雅思听力Section 1中，如果题干上问到了name或者type，答案在录音中基本都出现在called后面，可以帮助我们定位。\n第10题答案：reasonable\n对应原文： I’d probably describe it as\nreasonable\n解析：这道题的难点在于题干上的提示过于模糊，我们很难事先推断空上大概要填什么内容。不过根据问答节奏，其答案只能是reasonable。"

At Rexford, we have a strong research capability. We came 7th out of 101 universities in last year’s research assessment, carried out by a government body and did particularly well in your particular subjects, engineering, and science. Actually we got a top research grade of five for engineering, geography and computer sciences. One further point – and I know from talking to you individually that a number of you may be looking for some experience in the industry after the course – is that all our science and engineering research departments have unusually\nclose relationships with industry in the area\n. Anyway, that’s enough sales talk from me… I’ll just take a sip of this coffee that’s just arrived, thank you, and then I’ll say something about what actually happens when you apply.\nQ11/Q12\nRight… Now if you do decide to make an application, what you do is send it directly to me in my department. I will then immediately send confirmation and the application process begins. Er… I’d like to say at this point that you shouldn’t worry if this process doesn’t work all that quickly  I mean occasionally there are postal problems, but most often the hold-up is caused by\nreferences\n– the people you give as referees, shall we say, take their time to reply. Anyway, it’s absolutely normal for this process to take three to four months. What I do in this period is keep in touch with you and reassure you that things are moving along.\nQ13\nOne of the ways we’ve devised to help you decide about applying as well as later when you’ve been accepted… hopefully… is to put you in contact with, if possible, a student from your own\ncountry\nwho is at present studying with us. What you can do is phone them up – we will, of course, liaise between you – and discuss your concerns with them. That way you can get an objective opinion of what you can expect if you come to live and study at Rexford – not only the academic atmosphere but important details like what the leisure facilities are like and whether the English\nweather\nand food are really as awful as everybody says!\nQ14/Q15\nIf you decide you can face it, the contact can also help you just before you leave, with tips on what to pack and that sort of thing. At the moment I think we’ve got two second-year students and one postgraduate from this country.\nNow to move on to the other concerns you expressed earlier. At a UK university – as I’m sure you know – you will be in an environment where\nindependent learning is the norm\n, which takes most students a while to adjust to, and at a time when you will be separated from your normal surroundings and, in most cases, your family. This can be a difficult time. But remember that something like 25% of our student body are international students like yourselves, and that there are several organisations in the university and city whose main purpose is to offer help and ensure that your time with us is enjoyable and useful.\nQ16\nOne or two of you touched on the subject of accommodation earlier. So I’ll just add a few points: it is the University’s policy to give priority in the allocation of residence places to three categories, and those are: visiting students, exchange students and\nnew postgraduate students\n. However, demand exceeds supply, so there is still a need to put your name down early for campus accommodation, particularly if your family is accompanying you. This means that the earlier you decide whether you want to study with us… and so get the procedure moving, the better it will be for everybody. Yes?\nQ17\nWOMAN: What if you would prefer to live outside the university?\nMAN: If you’re planning to live off-campus, you’ve got to sort things out even earlier. As with everything in short supply, the good accommodation gets snapped up months before the beginning of term – in other words,\nif you’re starting in October you need to be thinking about it in June or at the very latest July\n. So you do need to think very carefully about what you need, how much you can afford to pay, well in advance. What you can’t do is leave it until a few days before the start of term. The agencies in town are pretty good – it’s just a matter of contacting them in good time. Of course, we have a full-time accommodation officer available to help all students. She’ll get in touch with you when you’re accepted – she’s got plenty of contacts in the town and\nwill deal with the agencies on your behalf\n.\nQ18/Q19\nOne or two of you asked me earlier about your level of spoken English. Obviously most of you have already achieved a lot – I wish I could speak your language half as well. Having said that though, I’m afraid the lecturers will make little or no allowance for the presence of non-native speakers in the audience. So anything you can do to improve your spoken English – even beyond the pretty high levels most of you have already reached – will help make your stay with us that bit more fun for you.\nSome extra practice before you arrive is worth more\nthan.., for example, private lessons afterwards, when you won’t really have time. Oh… and one last thing before I invite further questions: it’s very important that you…\nQ20\n剑5 test 3 Section 2雅思听力答案\n11-12. CE\n13. references\n14. country\n15. weather\n16. C\n17. C\n18. A\n19.

However, demand exceeds supply\n答案解析：读题的时候我们可以注意到这道题目的三个选项比较相似，差别只在前面的数量和后面的对象，因此可以将注意力放在这两方面。发现录音中只提到了C选项的new postgraduate students，由此确定答案。\n第18题答案：A\n对应原文： the good accommodation gets snapped up months before the beginning of term – in other words,\nif you’re starting in October you need to be thinking about it in June or at the very latest July\n.\n答案解析：录音中先说了好的宿舍在学期开始前好几个月就会被抢光，然后又用具体的月份表示需要提前多久，因此答案为A。录音虽然确实提到了two or three weeks，但说的是不能等到这时候，因此排除。\n第19题答案：B\n对应原文：She’ll get in touch with you when you’re accepted – she’s got plenty of contacts in the town and\nwill deal with the agencies on your behalf\n.\n答案解析：这道题的关键在于对on somebody’s behalf这一短语的理解上。只要知道它是代表某人的意思，即可确定B为正确答案。\n第20题答案：C\n对应原文：\nSome extra practice before you arrive is worth more\nthan.., for example, private lessons afterwards, when you won’t really have time\n答案解析：选项A完全没有提到。选项B和C的差别主要在于是来之前练习英语，还是来之后练习英语。而原文中说的是来之前练习比到之后更有价值，因此确定答案为C。"

I remember, my birthday’s on May 4th and it was the day after, it must have been\nMay 5th\n.\n答案解析：录音中先给了5月4日的干扰项，但那是女性的生日，而非课程开始的日期。因此排除。后面又特意给了must这一提示，确定答案为May 5th（顺序无所谓）。\n第22题答案：16th July/Friday 16th July\n对应原文：ANNIE: No, and we finish at the end of this week, on Friday, so that’s\nJuly\n15th?\nBEN: Er\n16th\n, Monday was the 12th.\n答案解析：这道题采用他人更正的手法，而且男性说正确答案的时候还特意不带上月份，给大家设置障碍。这种将日期分成两段回答，或者前面干扰项是完整日期后面只说一半的情况还是比较常见的，大家多加注意。\n第23题答案：clear/was clear\n对应原文：Yes, I think the organisation was\nclear\n答案解析：这道题比较简单，题干中的organisation原词出现，而且clear还重复了两次（听力中多次重复的词很容易作为答案出现）。\n第24题答案：(an/the) outline/(a/the) course outline\n对应原文： It was a good thing he gave us\nthe course outline\nat the beginning\n答案解析：这道题的难点有两个，一是题干与原文的替换幅度比较大，对应起来不太容易。二是outline（提纲）一词有些同学不怎么熟悉，导致没听出来。但这个词是Section 3讨论论文时超级常见的词汇，所以务必要掌握。\n第25题答案：(the) 2nd half\n对应原文： I thought it was going to be really easy and then all of a sudden in the\nsecond half\nof the course we got a whole load of work\n答案解析：录音中先以很清晰的语气说了at the beginning，部分同学就把它当作答案写了上去。但这里说的其实是开始的时候作业很少，不符合题干中的要求，因此排除。继续往下听，发现a whole load of work对应题干中的too much work，由此锁定second half。\n第26题答案：(standard of) teaching/(standard of) teachers\n对应原文：Well, what I thought was really good on this course was the\nstandard of teaching\n答案解析：题目比较简单，提示词course delivery原词出现，而且standard和teaching还在原文中还反复提及，想忽略都难。\n第27题答案：discussion/group discussion\n对应原文：I… I didn’t think it was all that wonderful when we had great long\ngroup discussion\nsessions that went on for hours and hours.\n答案解析：这道题的解题关键在于读题的时候就意识到题干末尾的too long是修饰答案的。这样一来，对录音中long之后的内容就会特别敏感。\n第28题答案：handouts\n对应原文：Oh, now what was good about some sessions was the\nhandouts\n.\n答案解析：与24题相似，这道题目的难度主要在于单词拼写。handout在听力中一般不表示传单，而是指任何分发的资料，也是Section 3比较常考的一个单词。\n第29题答案：written work\n对应原文： but I’m not so sure about the\nwritten work\n. One thing I think is that there’s just too much, it’s really stressful.\n答案解析：这道题采用倒置的手法，先说答案，然后隔一小段再说提示词，比较考验大家的短期记忆能力。这种出题方式在填空题中已经算是比较难的了。目前7分以上的同学要注意一下。\n第30题答案：student support/support for students\n对应原文：I thought\nstudent support\nwas excellent.\n答案解析：题目比较简单，表格第一列的Other comments原词出现，而且excellent也紧跟着答案，很好确认位置。"

This is a lower figure than in most other European countries, and needs to increase dramatically in the next few years if the government is going to meet its recycling targets.\nThe agreed targets for the UK mean that by 2008 we must reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by\n12.5%\n, compared with 1990. And recycling can help to achieve that goal, in two main ways: the production of recycled glass and paper uses much less energy than producing them from virgin materials, and also recycling reduces greenhouse gas emissions from landfill sites and\nincineration plants\n.\nQ31/Q32\nAs part of our project, we carried out a survey of people in the street, and the thing that came up over and over again is that people don’t think it’s easy enough to recycle their waste. One problem is that there aren’t enough ‘\ndrop-off\n’ sites, that is, the places where the public are supposed to take their waste.\nQ33\nWe also discovered that waste that’s collected from householders is taken to places called ‘bring banks’, for sorting and baling into loads. One problem here is taking out everything that shouldn’t have been placed in the recycling containers: people put all sorts of things into bottle banks, like plastic bags and even broken umbrellas. All this has to be removed by hand. Another difficulty is that toughened glass used for\ncooking\ndoesn’t fully melt at the temperature required for other glass, and so that also has to be picked out by hand.\nQ34\nGlass is easy to recycle because it can be reused over and over again without becoming weaker. Two million tons of glass is thrown away each year, that is, seven billion bottles and jars; but only\n500,000\ntons of that is collected and recycled.\nQ35\nOddly enough, half the glass that’s collected is green, and a lot of that is imported, so more green glass is recycled than the UK needs. As a result, new uses are being developed for recycled glass, particularly green glass, for example in fibreglass manufacture and water filtration. A company called CLF Aggregates makes a product for\nroads\n, and 30% of the material is crushed glass.\nQ36\nFor recycling paper, Britain comes second in Europe with 40%, behind Germany’s amazing 70%.\nWhen recycling started, there were quality problems, so it was difficult to use recycled paper in office printers. But these problems have now been solved, and Martin’s, based in South London, produces a range of office stationery which is 100% recycled, costs the same as normal paper and is of equally high quality.\nBut this high quality comes at a cost in terms of the waste produced during the process. Over a third of the waste paper that comes in can’t be used in the recycled paper, leaving the question of what to do with it. One firm, Papersave, currently sells this to farmers as a\nsoil conditioner\n, though this practice will soon be banned because of transport costs and the smell, and the company is looking into the possibility of alternative uses.\nQ37\nPlastic causes problems, because there are so many different types of plastic in use today, and each one has to be dealt with differently. Pacrite recycles all sorts of things, from bottles to car bumpers, and one of its most successful activities is recycling plastic bottles to make\ncontainers\nwhich are used all over the country to collect waste.\nQ38\nThe Save-a-Cup scheme was set up by the vending and plastics industries to recycle as many as possible of the three-and-a-half billion polystyrene cups used each year. At the moment 500 million polycups are collected, processed and sold on to other businesses, such as Waterford, which turns the cups into\npencils\n, and Johnson & Jones, a Welsh-based firm, which has developed a wide variety of items, including\nbusiness cards\n.\nQ39, Q40\nWell, to sum up, there seems to be plenty of research going on into how to re-use materials, but the biggest problem is getting people to think about recycling instead of throwing things away. At least doing the research made us much more careful.\n剑5 test 3 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31. 12.5%\n32. incineration plants\n33. drop-off\n34. cooking\n35. 500,000\n36. roads\n37. soil conditioner\n38. containers\n39. pencils\n40. business cards"

Good, I think I’d like to say ‘advanced’ but my written work is below the level of my spoken, so I suppose it’s\nintermediate\n.\n答案解析：这道题虽然出现了自我更正，先说advanced，然后给了解释，最后才说整体情况。但大部分同学都能找到intermediate这一答案。难点主要在拼写上。\n第5题答案：North-west\n对应原文：Ummm, well I’m studying right in the centre but I’d really like to live in the\nnorth-west\n.\n答案解析：前面center的干扰项比较明显，大多数同学都不会上当。north-west写成northwest或者north west都可以，大不大写也都可以。\n第6题答案：vegetarian\n对应原文：Well, I’m nearly a\nvegetarian\n答案解析：只要在租房场景中提到饮食要求，答案百分之八十以上都是vegetarian（素食主义者），所以大家务必要熟练掌握这个单词的拼写。\n第7题答案：(a) (real) garden\n对应原文：And also if it’s possible a TV and I’d also like the house to have a real\ngarden\nrather than just a yard\n答案解析：答案与TV并列，本身拼写也很简单，唯一需要注意的就是rather than表否定，别把yard写上去就行。\n第8题答案：(the) only guest\n对应原文：I’m really serious about improving my English so I’d prefer to be\nthe only guest\nif that’s possible?\n答案解析：一些同学可能会因为心急，把上文的peaceful当成答案写了上去。但peaceful其实是修饰garden的，不存在并列关系，因此排除。\n第9题答案：100\n对应原文：I was thinking in terms of about ￡60-￡80 a week, but I’d go up to\na hundred\nif it was something special.\n答案解析：不少同学容易受前面60和80的干扰。这里有两个小技巧可以帮忙，一是but之后的内容是答案的可能性要远高于but之前，二是题干上有maximum的限定条件，正确答案前面必须要有对应的词汇才可以。\n第10题答案：23rd March/Monday 23rd March\n对应原文：Let me see, it’s the 10th today… so if we go for the\nMonday\nit’s the\n23rd March\n答案解析：正常考察日期，没有什么难度。23rd的rd带不带都行。日期顺序也可以进行调整，March 23rd同样正确。"

It’s good to see so many parents and children here tonight, and I know you are looking forward to a great football season. Now I’d like to take a few minutes to tell you about some changes to the Soccer Club for the coming season.\nNow, this season we’ll be playing all our matches for both the junior and senior competitions at King’s Park, instead of Royal Park, which was used last season.\nNow for meetings, we’re going to use the\nclubhouse\nin King’s Park, and the next meeting will be held in the clubhouse on the 2nd of July.\nQ11\nAs usual, we hope to begin the season with a\npicnic\nnext Saturday at the clubhouse. Please try and come to the picnic as it’s always good fun. The last week of the season we usually have a dinner and presentation of\nprizes\nto the players, and more information about this will be given to you later in the season.\nQ12, Q13\nThis season we have more teams than ever. We hope to have\nten\nteams, instead of five, in the junior competition and they will play on Saturday mornings, beginning at 8.30 a. m. Training sessions will be held in King’s Park on\nWednesday afternoons\nfor the juniors and they will be wearing red shirts again this year.\nQ14, Q15\nIn the senior competition, there’ll be\nfour\nteams, the same as last year, and their games will be played on Saturday afternoons starting at 2.30, no sorry, it will be a 2 o’clock start, and the training session for seniors is planned for\nSunday afternoons\n.\nQ16, Q17\nNow I’d like to introduce you to the new committee for the Soccer Club for this season. Firstly, let me welcome Robert Young, the new President, who will manage the meetings for the next two years. Robert’s son has been playing football with the club for over five years now, and many thanks to Robert for taking on the job of President.\nNext we have Gina Costello, she’s the treasurer, and she will\ncollect the fees\nfrom you for the season. Please try and give Gina your fees as early as possible in the season, as the club needs the money to buy some new equipment.\nQ18\nThen there’s David West who has volunteered to be the club secretary, and one of the many jobs he will have is to\nsend out newsletters\nto you regularly. If you have any information that may be useful, please let David know so that it can be included in these newsletters.\nQ19\nAlso I’d like to introduce you to Jason Dokic who is the Head Coach. For all the new members here tonight, this is the third year that Jason has been with us as Head Coach, and we are very lucky to have such an experienced coach and former player at our club. He will continue to\nsupervise the teams\n, at training sessions and on match days.\nQ20\nNow before we finish and have some refreshments, does anyone have any questions they’d like to ask the new committee?\n剑5 test 4 Section 1雅思听力答案\n11. clubhouse\n12. picnic\n13. prizes\n14. 10\n15.

It’s interesting because they are in the middle of problems at the moment and I want you to track how they deal with them. Let’s start with you, Karin. Having read through the case study, can you just summarise what the problems were that Box Telecom had to take on board?\nKARIN: Um, yeah… Well of course what first came to their attention was that, despite a new advertising campaign, they were suffering from falling\nsales\n– and this is something that had many causes. On top of that immediate problem, what had also happened over the last two years was that, although they had invested in an expansion plan, they had to face up to increased\ncompetition\n. And, before they had a chance to get to grips with the effects of that, they were stalled by a strike and it was just when they were thinking about making a colossal investment in new machinery for their plants. So they were really in trouble.\nQ21, Q22\nTUTOR: Yes, I think that’s fair. And Jason, you contacted the company, didn’t you?What did the company define as the reasons for these problems?\nJASON: Well, I think they’ve hit on the right things – it would be easy to say they had invested too heavily, or at the wrong time, but in fact the signs were good and what they were set back by was high\ninterest rates\n. At the same time, their longer-term problems, which were affecting their market share, were eventually credited to poor\ntraining\n– and having looked at the details in their last report I think that’s right.\nQ23, Q24\nTUTOR: So, onto the larger issues then. Karin, what do you think the company will do?\nKARIN: Hmm… Well, obviously they have the choice of accepting the very favourable terms that another company – KMG Plc- have given them to buy them out. That would mean creating a new company with a new image. Or they could decide on a bolder move and offer some new shares if they wanted. But I think they’re much more cautious than that and expect they will start\ntrying to find individuals who’d be prepared to back them with some of the capital they need\n.\nQ25\nTUTOR: Well, you mustn’t always assume that dramatic problems require dramatic solutions. Sometimes there’s a simple fix such as changing the guy at the top. If they truly are cautious, then I suspect they will seek to shut down some of their shops. But a more ambitious approach, and one which I think would have more chance of success, would be to\nalter how they’re running things\n– the management layers and the processes. So in your analysis try to think of all the options. Jason?\nQ26\nJASON: Yes, it’s interesting because I’ve found it a really useful company to study. Its problems cross all types of industries and it’s lucky it’s so big – a smaller or even medium-sized company would have gone under by now.\nTUTOR: Ah well in fact, what I want you two to do is to go away when we’ve finished our discussion today and write a report. We’ve looked in general at the telecommunications market in the UK over the last few sessions and I want you to take Box Telecom as an example and\nsuggest some ways in which they might overcome their problems\n. And outline the reasons why you think as you do – but try and keep it intrinsic to the company rather than dragging in other examples. Is that OK, Karin?\nQ27\nKARIN: Yes, I think I can do that. Personally I’ve got great hopes for it.\nI think it will recover\n. That advertising campaign they did was very strong and they’re very innovative with their products – they set new trends. The company’s got to recover, don’t you think, Jason?\nQ28\nJASON: Hmmm – I’m not sure. I think it can but it’s not a foregone conclusion unless they manage\nto attract the right level of investment\n. The company definitely needs a boost\nand to attract more highly skilled workers if their recovery is to be long-lasting. When I was talking to the marketing manager he said to me that he thinks the company had got a great management team – but he would say that, wouldn’t he? – but they are suffering from having to work with outdated production machinery and that could cost a lot to put right.\nQ29\nTUTOR: Well, personally I think the stock market is to blame. I think they were expecting too much of the company and then inevitably it looked bad when it didn’t perform. The market should have had more realistic expectations.\nAnd I disagree with you about the advertising campaign Karin. That’s where they could do with some innovation\n– to get sales kick-started.

I think it can but it’s not a foregone conclusion unless they manage\nto attract the right level of investment\n. The company definitely needs a boost\n答案解析：与上一道题目一样，男性一开始就说了自己的观点。如果只听到这里的话比较容易确定B是答案。但后面他又说了很多东西，不少同学以为这里面才有答案，反而因为没绕明白而不知道该选哪个。\n第30题答案：D\n对应原文：\nAnd I disagree with you about the advertising campaign Karin. That’s where they could do with some innovation\n答案解析：老师的观点需要结合女生的观点来看。女生之前提到他们的市场营销策略还不错。但老师说这点我不同意，他们需要在这方面进行更多的创新。对应D选项中的市场营销活动需要提升。因此确定答案。"

Well, first of all, welcome to Cardiff University. I’m here to explain what we can offer you.\nNow, as a new student at the university, you will probably need some sort of guidance to help you to use the library effectively to study and research. Some of you have asked about a guided tour but we find this rather muddles people. So,\nin this first week, we run a series of talks which focus on different aspects of the library and its resources\n. You’ll also find that to get the most out of the library you really do need to be computer literate and so all this term we run small classes which will bring you up to speed on how to access the computer-loaded information.\nQ31\nOK, now let me give you an outline of what’s available to you. You’ll find that the computers are increasingly used as a research tool. Many students do most of their research on the internet and the library computers are permanently online. Having found what you need, you’ll find you can readily save texts on your personal computer space to print off when you need. You might think that it is the fastest way to get information but the links can be slow.\nClearly you can find lots on there but much of it is useless information as it is from highly debatable sources\n– so be critical. You’ll also find that the library has loaded several CD-ROMS onto the computers from specialist reference sources such as the MLA. It means we can expand what we offer you\nat very little extra cost\nand saves us having to invest in more and more books. The CD-ROMS contain exactly the same information as the reference books as the two are updated together.\nQ32, Q33\nNow most of you will need to refer to journal articles in your work and you’ll find you can also access these online and we encourage you to do so.\nClearly some of you will find the printed version more accessible as it sits on the shelves but I’m afraid the intention is to phase these out eventually\n. However, you will still be able to print off a version of the text rather than photocopying the journal pages. So you must get used to working online. Naturally we do still have the full range of classic reference books, additional to the CD-ROMS, for you to use and there are several copies of each one. This is because\nsome of you may prefer to borrow a book rather than sit in the library\n. There is a restricted loan time on these so that they are not missing from the shelves for too long. Although there is a Section Manager for each part of the library, they are very busy and so, if you do get stuck looking for things, you should ask the relevant Cataloguing Assistant. As your Training Supervisor,\nI just oversee your induction\nand will not be around after this initial week.\nQ34, Q35, Q36\nSome of you may be interested to know that the library is offering specialised training sessions on writing a dissertation. Obviously this is not relevant to those of you who are undergraduates; it is just for postgraduates. Your department will discuss the planning stage of the dissertation – i.e. what you’re going to do – with you and we will focus on the structure of it. However,\nthe training will also include some time on the computers\n. I realise most of you know how to organise files but we can show you the\ndifferent ways to run data programmes\n. Your tutors will tell you at the outset how to set out the chapters they require but you will need to\nask them how they would like you to organise the bibliography\nbecause it varies depending on your subject area.\nWhen you’ve got something together the trainer here will look through the draft version for you to see if it’s OK\n. And, one final point, for those of you who have registered from abroad, we can offer individual sessions on dissertations if you feel you need them.\nIf you require language lessons then they are available from the International Centre next to the Law Department\n.\nQ37, Q38, Q39, Q40\n剑5 test 4 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31.

I was wondering if you could give me some information about membership and facilities.\nWOMAN: Of course. What would you like to know?\nMAN: Do you have tennis courts, for example?\nWOMAN: No, I’m afraid we don’t. We’re primarily a golf club.\nMAN: What about football? I heard you had a team.\nWOMAN: No, I’m sorry. Perhaps you’re thinking about Fresham Sports Centre.\nMAN: Oh, right. I know it. I’ve played badminton there.\nWOMAN: Have you? They’ve got a lot of facilities we don’t have and vice versa. We do have\na keep-fit studio\n, which is very popular with members, and then as well as that there’s\nswimming\n, of course.\nQ1   Q2\nMAN: That’s good. I like to swim every day.\nWOMAN: We have a range of classes too.\nMAN: Do you have judo classes? I’m keen to learn.\nWOMAN: Well, at the moment we offer kick-boxing. We’re planning to add judo and stretch classes soon. We’re currently running a range of\nyoga classes\n, too.\nQ3\nMAN: What about relaxing after exercise? I assume you have a restaurant or something.\nWOMAN: At the moment, we’ve got\na salad bar\nwhich is very popular. We’ll also have a fully-licensed restaurant by the end of the year.\nQ4\nMAN: Sounds good!\nWOMAN: What kind of membership are you interested in?\nMAN: Um I’m not really sure. What are the options?\nWOMAN: Well, there are three different membership schemes.\nMAN: I see. What’s the difference?\nWOMAN: Well, the first one’s called Gold, and you can use all the facilities at any time of the day or week. You can also join in as many classes as you like for free.\nMAN: That sounds good. Is it very expensive?\nWOMAN: Well, you pay a ￡250 joining fee and then it’s ￡450 – oh no, I’m sorry, it’s just gone up by ￡50, sorry about that – it’s now\n￡500\nfor the annual subscription fee.\nQ5\nMAN: Right, got that. And what’s the next type?\nWOMAN: Well, that’s Silver – it’s the same as Gold except you have to pay a small fee of\n￡1.00\nper lesson for any you do and you can only use the centre at certain times.\nQ6\nMAN: I see. So when exactly?\nWOMAN: You can only use the facilities\nbetween 10 am and 4.30 pm\n.\nQ7\nMAN: So I couldn’t use the pool at 8 in the morning or evening, then?\nWOMAN: That’s right.\nMAN: OK. And the price for that? Is the joining fee the same as for Gold?\nWOMAN: Actually, it’s slightly less than the ￡250 – it’s ￡225, but the annual fee is only ￡300. Does that sound more like what you want?\nMAN: Well, it’s still rather more expensive than I thought. I’m a student here in England and I’m only here for six months.\nWOMAN: Ah, then the Bronze scheme would probably suit you best.\nMAN: How is that different?\nWOMAN: Well, some of the facilities have restricted use.\nMAN: And do I have to pay for classes?\nWOMAN: Yes, it’s ￡3 for each class you join.\nMAN:  I see. And what are the hours then?\nWOMAN: Between 10.30 and 3.30 weekdays only and you pay a ￡50 joining fee. The annual fee is\n￡180\n– it works out at ￡15 a month, so that would be quite a lot cheaper.  Q8\nMAN: Oh, that should be all right. I could come in my free periods. What do I have to do if I want to join?\nWOMAN: Well, we book you in for an\nassessment\nwith an instructor, who will show you how to use all the equipment. If you want to organise a trial session and look around the centre, you’ll need to speak to David Kynchley.\nQ9\nMAN: Hmm. Could you spell that please?\nWOMAN: Yes, David\nK-Y-N-C-H-L-E-Y\n.

We do have\na keep-fit studio\n答案解析：这道题的难点有两个。一是男性提出了多种项目，但都被依次否决，很容易仍然心浮气躁。而是keep-fit studio这一短语不少同学可能不太熟悉。但它是健身房场景中最容易考察的内容之一，所以一定要熟练掌握。\n第2题答案：\nswimming\n对应原文： and then as well as that there’s\nswimming\n, of course.\n答案解析：as well as提示答案即将到来，swimming本身也没有什么难度，很容易写出来。\n第3题答案：\nyoga (classes)\n对应原文：Well, at the moment we offer kick-boxing. We’re planning to add judo and stretch classes soon. We’re currently running a range of\nyoga classes\n, too\n答案解析：kick-boxing提示答案即将到来。judo和stretch classes因为是并列，而且还有plan这种表示计文章来自老烤鸭雅思划的词汇，可以直接排除。最终确定yoga classes是答案。不过这一题中出现的所有运动项目都需要大家掌握。\n第4题答案：\nsalad bar\n对应原文：At the moment, we’ve got\na salad bar\nwhich is very popular.\n答案解析：确定答案位置毫无难度，主要难点还在于salad bar的含义。它其实就是大家在餐厅里常见的自主沙拉区，可以自己随便拿东西浇酱汁。\n第5题答案：\n500\n对应原文：then it’s ￡450 – oh no, I’m sorry, it’s just gone up by ￡50, sorry about that – it’s now\n￡500\nfor the annual subscription fee.\n答案解析：虽然设置了干扰项450，但后面的否定十分明显，几乎不可能出错，很容易确定答案为500。唯一需要注意的就是誊写答题卡的时候500前面的货币符号并不需要带。\n第6题答案：\n1\n对应原文：it’s the same as Gold except you have to pay a small fee of\n￡1.00\nper lesson for any you do\n答案解析：毫无难度，注意听数字即可。\n第7题答案：\n10 am, 4.30 pm\n对应原文：You can only use the facilities\nbetween 10 am and 4.30 pm\n.\n答案解析：根据题干同一列内容可以推测出空上应该填具体的时间，写完上一题答案之后注意听时间即可。\n第8题答案：\n180\n对应原文： The annual fee is\n￡180\n答案解析：因为one hundred and eighty中的连读，这道题很容易写成190。大家要注意分辨/ei/和/ai/这两个元音的差别。\n第9题答案：\nassessment\n对应原文：Well, we book you in for an\nassessment\nwith an instructor\n答案解析：这道题设置了两个难点。一是进行了语序颠倒，将本来在空前的instructor放在空后；二是assessment这一单词本身可能会有些陌生。它经常出现在健身房场景中表示评测，也会出现在Section 3的学术场景中表示考试或者测试。\n第10题答案：\nKynchley\n对应原文：Yes, David\nK-Y-N-C-H-L-E-Y\n.\n答案解析：根据题干可以推断出空上应该填人名，注意听拼写即可。"

Hello, Lynne.\nLYNNE: Hello.\nMAN: Now, the theatre is reopening soon after its three-year redevelopment programme, isn’t it?\nLYNNE: That’s right, and there are a lot of improvements. The first thing people will see when they go in is that the foyer has been repainted in the original green and gold. Then\nthe box office has been reoriented, with its own access from the side of the building\ninstead of through the foyer, which means it can be open longer hours, and has more space, too. The shop that used to be in the foyer, which sold books and CDs, is the one part of the redevelopment which isn’t yet complete. The plan is to find new premises for it near the theatre, and we’ve had difficulty finding somewhere suitable.\nWe hope to reopen the shop in the next few months\n.\nQ11  Q12\nMAN: Will audiences find any difference in the auditorium?\nLYNNE: Yes, we’ve increased the leg-room between the rows. This means that\nthere are now fewer seats\nbut we’re sure audiences will be much happier. And we’ve installed air conditioning, so it won’t get so hot and stuffy. We already had a few seats which were suitable for wheelchair users, and\nnow there are twice as many\n, which we hope will meet demand. Something else that will benefit audiences is the\nnew lifts. The two we used to have were very small and slow. They’ve now gone, and we’ve got much more efficient ones\n.\nQ13  Q14  Q15\nMAN: Anything for the performers?\nLYNNE: Yes, we’ve made a number of improvements backstage.\nThe small, dark dressing rooms we used to have have been converted into two large airy rooms\n, so they’re much more comfortable now. And the state-of-the-art electronic sound and lighting systems have been installed.\nQ16\nMAN: OK, so what’s the first play that audiences can see when the theatre reopens?\nLYNNE: We’ve got a very exciting production of Peter Shaffer’s Royal Hunt of the Sun, which is currently touring the country. That starts on October the 13th and runs till\nthe 19th\n. We’re experimenting a bit with the time the curtain goes up. We used to start all our performances at 7.30, but that made it difficult for people to go home by public transport, so instead we’re beginning at\n7\n, because at 9.45, when it finishes, there are still buses running. Tickets are already selling fast. The Friday and Saturday performances sold out almost immediately and, in fact, now there are only tickets for\nMonday\nand\nThursday\n.\nQ17  Q18  Q19\nMAN: How much are they?\nLYNNE: We’ve introduced a simpler price structure. Ticket prices used to range from ￡6 to ￡30 but now they’re all\n￡18\n. They’re available from the box office, in person, by phone, fax or post, or online.\nQ20\nMAN: OK, Lynne, now if you’d like to give the contact details for the theatre…\n剑6 test 1 Section 2雅思听力答案\n11.

This means that\nthere are now fewer seats\nbut we’re sure audiences will be much happier.\n答案解析：一些同学容易受前面increase the leg-room的干扰，直接选了D。但它指的是座位之间的腿部空间有所增加，而非座位本身。后面fewer才是答案真正对应的点。\n第14题答案：A\n对应原文：We already had a few seats which were suitable for wheelchair users, and\nnow there are twice as many\n答案解析：这道题目比较简单一些，主要考察倍数的替换，将double换成twice而已。\n第15题答案：E\n对应原文： Something else that will benefit audiences is the\nnew lifts. The two we used to have were very small and slow. They’ve now gone, and we’ve got much more efficient ones\n.\n答案解析：原来的电梯又小又慢，现在有更加效率的新的了。因此确定答案为E（替换）。一些同学可能觉得以前的比较小，现在的一定很大，因此推测答案为D。但无论是老烤鸭雅思听力还是阅读，除非万不得已，否则的话只能根据原文中给出的明确信息做题，千万不要推断。\n第16题答案：D\n对应原文：\nThe small, dark dressing rooms we used to have have been converted into two large airy rooms\n答案解析：原文中提到“原来又小，又黑的更衣室被转变为两个大型又通风的房间”。small和large前后对比，因此确定答案为D。\n第17题答案：（October） 19th\n对应原文：That starts on October the 13th and runs till\nthe 19th\n.\n答案解析：从表头的dates和空前的October 13th很容易推断空上应该填个日期。注意听序数词即可。\n第18题答案：7\n对应原文：We used to start all our performances at 7.30, but, this article is from Laokaoya website, that made it difficult for people to go home by public transport, so instead we’re beginning at\n7\n答案解析：录音中先提到了7.30，但说人们乘坐公共交通回家不太方便，现在改成了7。除了听明白之外，我们还可以根据but和instead这两个转折词进行判断。\n第19题答案：Monday, Thursday\n对应原文：in fact, now there are only tickets for\nMonday\nand\nThursday\n答案解析：虽然我们在读题的时候无法根据题干推断空上填的是周几。但录音中句子结构毫无改变，很容易确定答案为Monday和Thursday。\n第20题答案：18\n对应原文：Ticket prices used to range from ￡6 to ￡30 but now they’re all\n￡18\n答案解析：出题套路跟第18题有些类似，都是先给出一个符合猜想的数字，然后再进行更正，注意but即可。"

I’m one of the tutors, so I should be able to help you.\nBRIAN:                    Oh, good. My name’s Brian Ardley. I’ve decided to enrol on a part-time management course. A friend of mine took one last year, and recommended it to me.\nTUTOR:                   Right.\nBRIAN:                    Is there anything I should do before the course, like reading or anything?\nTUTOR:                   We prefer to integrate reading with the course, so we don’t give out a reading list in advance. But we like people to write a case study, describing an organisation they know.\nBRIAN:                    I’ve already done that, as my friends told me you wanted one. But would it be possible to\nsit in on a teaching session\n, to see what it’s like? I haven’t been a student for quite a while.\nQ21\nTUTOR:                   Fine. Just let me know which date, and I’ll arrange it with the tutor.\nBRIAN:                    Now, could I ask you about the college facilities, please?\nTUTOR:                   Anything in particular?\nBRIAN:                    Well, the course is one day a week, all day, isn’t it? So presumably it’s possible to buy food?\nTUTOR:                   Yes, the refectory’s open all day.\nBRIAN:                    Does it cater for special diets? I have some food allergies.\nTUTOR:                   Provided you warn the refectory\nin advance\n, it won’t be a problem.\nQ22\nBRIAN:                    Good. What about facilities for young children? I’d like to bring my daughter here while I’m studying.\nTUTOR:                   How old is she?\nBRIAN:                    Three.\nTUTOR:                   Then she’s eligible to join the\nnursery\n, which is supervised by a qualified Nursery Nurse. The waiting list for a place is quite long though, so you ought to apply now.\nQ23\nBRIAN:                    OK.\nTUTOR:                   I don’t know if our careers advice service would be of any interest to you?\nBRIAN:                    Yes, it might help me decide how to develop my career after the course.\nTUTOR:                   The centre has a lot of reference materials, and staff qualified to give guidance on a one-to-one basis.\nBRIAN:                    I noticed a fitness centre next to the college. Is that for students?\nTUTOR:                   It’s open to everyone, but students pay an\nannual fee\nthat’s much less than the general public pay.\nQ24\nBRIAN:                    And presumably the college library stocks newspapers and journals, as well as books?\nTUTOR:                   Yes, and there’s also an audio-visual room, for viewing and listening to videos, cassettes, and so on.\nBRIAN:                    Is there also access to computers?\nTUTOR:                   Yes, your\ntutor\nwill need to arrange with the technical support team for you to get a password, so ask him or her about it when you start the course.\nQ25\nBRIAN:                    OK.\nTUTOR:                   By the way, do you know about our Business Centre?\nBRIAN:                    No. What’s that?\nTUTOR:                   It’s a training resource a collection of materials for people to study on their own, or use in their own organisations.\nBRIAN:                    Uhuh. You mean books and videos?\nTUTOR:                   Yes, and manuals for self-study. Plus a lot of computer-based materials, so people can work through them at their own speed, and repeat anything they aren’t sure about. And you can hire\nlaptops\nto use in your own home or workplace as well as\nprinters\nthat you can take away.\nQ26/27\nBRIAN:                    Does it have anything that I could use to improve my study skills? I don’t have much idea about\nreport writing\n, and I’m sure I’ll need it on the course.\nQ28\nTUTOR:                   Oh yes, there’s plenty of useful material. Just ask one of the staff.\nBRIAN:                    Does the centre cover all the main areas of business?\nTUTOR:                   Yes, topics like finance, and of course\nmarketing\n– that’s a popular one. Local managers seem to queue up to borrow the videos!\nQ29\nBRIAN:                    So it isn’t just for students, then?\nTUTOR:                   No, it’s for members only, but anyone can join.\nBRIAN:                    How much does it cost?\nTUTOR:                   ￡100 a year for a company, and ￡50 for an\nindividual\n, with no discount for students, I’m afraid.\nQ30\nBRIAN:                    That’s very helpful. Well, I think that’s all. I’d better go home and fill in the enrolment form. Thanks for all your help.\nTUTOR:                   You’re welcome. Goodbye.\nBRIAN:                    Goodbye.\n剑6 test 1 Section 3雅思听力答案\n21.

I don’t have much idea about\nreport writing\n答案解析：听到study skills提示答案即将出现。虽然空前的e.g.在录音中没有对应，但根据句子位置和重读，很容易锁定report writing.\n第29题答案：marketing\n对应原文：Yes, topics like finance, and of course\nmarketing\n答案解析：再次考察并列关系，不过finance和and都原词出现，相比于27题而言还要再简单一些。\n第30题答案：individual\n对应原文： ￡100 a year for a company, and ￡50 for an\nindividual\n答案解析：这道题目中设置了小小的干扰项。出题人希望大家听到company就认为是答案。但它并不符合后面50这一条件，因此排除，锁定individual。"

I’ll start with a brief history of the district, and then focus on life in the first half of the twentieth century.\nBack in the first to the fourth centuries AD, when the Romans controlled England, London grew into a town of 45,000 people, and what’s now the East End – the area by the river Thames, and along the road heading north-east from London to the coast – consisted of farmland with crops and livestock which helped to\nfeed\nthat population.\nQ31\nThe Romans left in 410, at the beginning of the fifth century, and from then onwards the country suffered a series of invasions by tribes from present-day Germany and Denmark, the Angles, Saxons and Jutes, many of whom settled in the East End. The technology they introduced meant that\nmetal\nand\nleather\ngoods were produced there for the first time. And as the East End was by the river, ships could transport goods between there and foreign markets.\nQ32\nIn the eleventh century, in 1066 to be precise, the Normans conquered England, and during the next few centuries London became one of the most powerful and prosperous cities in Europe. The East End benefited from this, and because there were fewer\nrestrictions\nthere than in the city itself, plenty of newcomers settled there from abroad, bringing their skills as workers, merchants or money-lenders during the next few hundred years.\nQ33\nIn the sixteenth century the first dock was dug where\nships\nwere constructed, eventually making the East End the focus of massive international trade. And in the late sixteenth century, when much of the rest of\nEngland\nwas suffering economically, a lot of agricultural workers came to the East End to look for alternative work.\nQ34    Q35\nIn the seventeenth century, the East End was still a series of separate, semi-rural settlements. There was a shortage of accommodation, so marshland was drained and\nbuilt\non to house the large numbers of people now living there.\nQ36\nBy the nineteenth century London was the busiest port in the world, and this became the main source of employment in the East End. Those who could afford to live in more pleasant surroundings moved out, and the area became one where the vast majority of people lived in extreme\npoverty\nand suffered from appalling sanitary conditions.\nQ37\nThat brief outline takes us to the beginning of the twentieth century, and now we’ll turn to housing.\nAt the beginning of the century, living conditions for the majority of working people in East London were very basic indeed.\nHouses were crowded closely together and usually very badly built\n, because there was no regulation. But the poor and needy were attracted by the possibility of work, and they had to be housed. It was the availability, rather than the condition, of the housing that was the major concern for tenants and landlords alike.\nQ38\nFew houses had electricity at this time, so other sources of power were used, like coal for the fires which heated perhaps just one room.\nOf course, the smoke from these contributed a great deal to the air pollution for which London used to be famous.\nQ39\nA tiny, damp, unhealthy house like this might well be occupied by two full families, possibly including several children, grandparents, aunts and uncles.\nQ40\nNow, before I go on to health implications of this way of life, I’ll say something about food and nutrition.\n剑6 test 1 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31. feed\n32. metal leather\n33. restrictions\n34. ships\n35.

I’m interested in the children’s workshops and I’d like a little more information, please.\nMAN:                       Do you mean the Art and Craft workshops?\nWOMAN:                 Yes. A friend of a friend mentioned them – the children do painting and make models and so forth.\nMAN:                       Yes, of course. Um, where to begin? First of all, as you probably know, they run every\nSaturday\n.\nExample\nWOMAN:                 Fine. And what about ages?\nMAN:                       Well, all ages from five upwards are welcome, though we do ask that children below\neight\nyears of age are accompanied by an adult.\nQ1\nWOMAN:                 Fine. That wouldn’t be a problem. What about cost?\nMAN:                       Well, I think you’ll find them very reasonable. It’s ￡2.50 a child, with 80 pence off for two or more children from the same family.\nWOMAN:                 Oh yes, very reasonable.

We’re driving in from out of town.\nMAN:                       Your best bet is to leave your car at the back of the\nlibrary\n– on a Saturday morning there are plenty of spaces there.

But for future reference, I’ll give you the direct number. It’s two hundred-seven-six-five.\nWOMAN:                 Great, I’ve got that.\nMAN:                       But I’m very happy to give you information about the next two workshops. On Saturday the 16th there’s Building\nCastles\n.\nQ6\nWOMAN:                 Oh, sounds great!\nMAN:                       This involves quite a bit of glue, so just make sure the kids are in\nold clothes\n.\nQ7\nWOMAN:                 I know, ones I don’t mind getting mucky.\nMAN:                       Exactly. And if possible, could you bring along\nbottle tops\nwhich the children might be able to use in the models, you know, as decoration?\nQ8\nWOMAN:                 We’ll certainly try to find some for you.\nMAN:                       Then the following week…\nWOMAN:                 That’ll be the 23rd, won’t it?\nMAN:                       Yes, that’s right. On that day, it’s what we call\nUndersea Worlds\n. This is where they make scenes with fishes, underground caverns and so on.\nQ9\nWOMAN:                 Is that likely to get very dirty? Lots of paint splashes?\nMAN:                       Not really, so we don’t recommend any special clothes for that one. But if you could search out some\nsilver paper\nto bring along to use in the sessions, you know, it’s shiny – it looks like water, that’d be great.\nQ10\nWOMAN:                 Yes, of course. We’ll see what we can come up with. Well, thank you ever so much for all your help. The sessions sound really good and I’ll certainly book up for the next two.\nMAN:                       Lovely.

Don’t press the red button please\n答案解析：题干中的push被替换为press，由此确定答案。原文里后面还通过否定的方式设置了red button这一干扰项，只要注意don’t即可。\n第4题答案：library\n对应原文：  Your best bet is to leave your car at the back of the\nlibrary\n答案解析：题干中的behind在录音中替换成at the back of，由此确定答案。这组同义替换在雅思听力中非常常见，大家务必要记清楚。\n第5题答案：education department\n对应原文： Yes, and I must tell you, you really should book by calling the\neducation department\nhere.\n答案解析：题干中的phoning被替换成calling，由此确定答案为education department。其中department在这里表示部门的意思，也算是雅思听力中比较常见的一个单词。\n第6题答案：castles\n对应原文： On Saturday the 16th there’s Building\nCastles\n.\n答案解析：空前词building毫无替换直接出现，很容易锁定答案。主要难度还在于castle的拼写。请大家一定记着中间还有个t，忘掉的话肯定就没分了。\n第7题答案：old clothes\n对应原文：so just make sure the kids are in\nold clothes\n答案解析：从表头children advised to wear可以推断出空上应该填具体的穿着。上一题结束之后根据问答节奏定位大体的位置，只有old clothes符合这一含义，由此确定答案。\n第8题答案：bottle tops\n对应原文： And if possible, could you bring along\nbottle tops\n答案解析：表头中的bring原词出现，确定答案并不难。不过一些同学因为不知道tops在这里表示瓶盖，犹豫半天都不太敢写。\n第9题答案：Undersea Worlds\n对应原文： On that day, it’s what we call\nUndersea Worlds\n答案解析：答案不算太难，但因为是个专有名词，所以词组搭配不太常见。有些同学会写成undersea words。注意单词中间有无转音即可。\n第10题答案：silver paper\n对应原文：But if you could search out some\nsilver paper\nto bring along\n答案解析：难点主要在silver（银色）的拼写上。除此之外，雅思听力还经常考察gold（金色），purple（紫色），pink（粉色），grey（灰色），blue（蓝色）等颜色。"

Um my family and I are staying here in Trebirch for a week or two and we wanted to know about the train services. We’re hoping to do a few local trips.\nRAILPERSON:         OK. Well, I can give you lots of details about all the trains going from Trebirch in the South West. This leaflet will be very helpful but I can tell you some of the main things. We’ve got two main train stations in the town.\nKing Street\nis for local commuter lines and regional services.\nQ11\nCUSTOMER:           What about trains to London? I’ll need to go there on business for one day.\nRAILPERSON:         Then you need to go to\nCentral\nStation – that’s for all the national services. There are regular trains to London. They leave Trebirch\nevery half hour\non weekdays and every hour at weekends. It takes about two hours, a bit longer on Sundays. You’ve got a choice of first and second class and there’s a buffet car – though\nrefreshments\nare included in the cost of a first class ticket.\nQ12  Q13  Q14\nCUSTOMER:           Ah right. Um, and have you got any information on different ticket types?\nRAILPERSON:         Yes. There’s a range of ticket prices depending on when you travel and when you buy your ticket. There’s a standard open ticket which doesn’t have any restrictions. This can be bought in advance or on the day. You can also get various discounted tickets. A popular one is called the Supersave and, er, this is OK for travel after 8.45. Then there is the Special ticket, which is valid for travel after\n10.15\n. The Special tickets are also valid for travel at weekends. The cheapest tickets are called\nAdvance\nand you have to buy them at least six days ahead. Only a certain number are available and you have to make seat\nreservations\nfor these.\nQ15  Q16  Q17\nCUSTOMER:           Thanks. And are there lots of places to go to around here?\nRAILPERSON:      Oh yes. You can enjoy many days out. Um there’s the Merthyr\nMining Museum\n, which is only half an hour from Trebirch by train. Your children will find it just as fascinating as any theme park and they can ride in the original miners’ lifts and on the coal trains. There are special excursion tickets which include entrance fees. Mainline trains also offer direct services to Bristol, where you can visit the docks or spend a great day out with the children in the\nzoo\n, which is set in the parkland that used to surround the old castle. Er, special family awayday fares are available for this service now during the school holidays. Er, alternatively, you can be in Birmingham in only an hour and a half, where there’s lots to see and do including the new and internationally-acclaimed\nclimbing wall\nbuilt on the site of the old aquarium. We will also be running a special service to Newport when the new science museum opens next year, as we anticipate a lot of visitors in the opening weeks. I’d advise you to call early to book your tickets. Is that OK?\nQ18  Q19  Q20\nCUSTOMER:           Yes, thanks.\n剑6 test 2 Section 2雅思听力答案\n11. king street\n12. central\n13. half hour/30 minutes\n14. refreshments\n15. 10.15\n16. Advance\n17.

They leave Trebirch\nevery half hour\non weekdays and every hour at weekends.\n答案解析：题目中设置了小小的干扰项，平日里是每半个小时一趟，周末是每小时一趟。如果大家在填空题中看到题干上有时间或者地点的限制，就要小心干扰项了。\n第14题答案：refreshments\n对应原文：though\nrefreshments\nare included in the cost of a first class ticket.\n答案解析：这道题有两个难点，一是题目采用语序颠倒的手法，将题干中的句子倒置，比较考验大家的短时记忆能力。二是refreshment的含义。它在听力中经常表示食物，与food和snack同义替换。\n第15题答案：10.15\n对应原文：Then there is the Special ticket, which is valid for travel after\n10.15\n.\n答案解析：从同一列单元格的内容中可以推测出空上应该填时间，然后注意听即可。\n第16题答案：Advance\n对应原文：The cheapest tickets are called\nAdvance\nand you have to buy them at least six days ahead.\n答案解析：这道题设计到一个小技巧。雅思听力中如果问到name或者type，答案一般都出现在called后面。通过这点事先预测，可以大大降低锁定答案的难度。\n第17题答案：(seat) reservations\n对应原文： you have to make seat\nreservations\nfor these\n答案解析：听到a certain number与limited numbers的对应意识到答案即将到来。essential在原文中被替换为have to，由此确定答案。reservation也是雅思听力中超级经常考察的词汇，在选择题中会与booking同义替换。\n第18题答案：D\n对应原文： there’s the Merthyr\nMining Museum\n, which is only half an hour from Trebirch by train.\n答案解析：这个选项中设置了theme park的干扰项，但录音只是拿矿场博物馆跟主题公园进行比较，并没有说可以去主题公园玩耍。\n第19题答案：G\n对应原文：you can visit the docks or spend a great day out with the children in the\nzoo\n, which is set in the parkland that used to surround the old castle.\n答案解析：选项设置了old castle的干扰项，但录音中用的是used to，也就是说castle已经是过去的事情了，现在并没有。\n第20题答案：C\n对应原文：including the new and internationally-acclaimed\nclimbing wall\nbuilt on the site of the old aquarium.\n答案解析：干扰项为E aquarium，录音中的意思是攀岩墙位于水族馆的旧址上。可见水族馆现在已经没有了。因此排除。"

How have you been getting on with your dissertation?\nSANDY:                   Fine, and I’ve been working hard on the various action points we agreed on our last tutorial.\nTUTOR:                   Do you want to talk me through what you’ve done?\nSANDY:                   Yeah, sure. Well, we agreed on three main targets for me to aim for. The first one was to find out about suitable data analysis software.\nTUTOR:                   Yes.\nSANDY:                   And what I decided to do was to look through\ncatalogues\nspecialising in IT.\nQ21\nTUTOR:                   That’s a good idea. What did you come up with?\nSANDY:                   I found the names of two promising ones.\nTUTOR:                   Right.\nSANDY:                   But I also thought it’d be worthwhile talking to a lecturer.\nTUTOR:                   Oh right. Who did you see?\nSANDY:                   Jane Prince. Do you know her? She’s in the\nComputer Centre\n.\nQ22\nTUTOR:                   Yes, of course, she’s the new Head.\nSANDY:                   Yes. Well, she was very helpful.\nTUTOR:                   Oh, that’s good. Did she suggest anything in particular?\nSANDY：                Yeah. She recommended software called Vivat and said I should book up for a couple of practice sessions using Vivat.\nTUTOR:                   Great. I’m sure you’ll find them useful.\nSANDY:                   And, of course, the second target was to draw up a survey\nchecklist\nwhich I…\nQ23\nTUTOR:                   Yes, you emailed me it last week.\nSANDY:                   Have you had a chance to look…?\nTUTOR:                   Of course, um I think it’s good. Very much on the right lines. I’d say your first two sections are spot on. I wouldn’t suggest that you change anything there, but in section three you really do need to have questions on\nteaching experience\n.\nQ24\nSANDY:                   Yeah. I was thinking that section looked a bit short.\nTUTOR:                   Right.\nSANDY:                   And my third target was, do further reading on discipline.\nTUTOR:                   Oh yes. I mentioned a couple of writers, didn’t I?\nSANDY:                   Yes, well I got hold of the Banerjee and I thought that was excellent. But I’m afraid I didn’t manage to get hold of the essays about\nclassroom\nmanagement – you know, the ones by Simon Ericsson. The bookshop said it was out of print and the library doesn’t have a copy.\nQ25\nTUTOR:                   Oh right, and I’m afraid I’ve lent my copy to another student. What I suggest you do is try the library again – this time apply for it through the service called special loans. Have you done that before? You’re entitled to six books a year.\nSANDY:                   Yes. No problem. That’s what I’ll do.\nTUTOR:                   SO, lots of useful work done.\nTUTOR:                   So, let’s look at some new targets. We’ll start by having a chat about your Chapter One. I very much enjoyed reading it. Your written style is very clear and you’ve included lots of interesting descriptions of education in your target area. I’ve just got a couple of suggestions for some additional work.\nSANDY:                   Of course. Could I just ask – what do you think I should call it?\nTUTOR:                   Well, I’d go for something like Context\nReview\n. What do you think?\nQ26\nSANDY:                   Well, short and to the point.\nTUTOR:                   Exactly. Now, as regards specific areas to work on, I’d be quite interested to have a few more statistics about the\nschools\nin the different zones.\nQ27\nSANDY:                   Oh, that wouldn’t be a problem. I can get them from the Internet.\nTUTOR:                   Great, and although you did make a reference to quite a few different writers, I think you should aim to cite more works written later than\n2000\n.\nQ28\nSANDY:                   OK. That’s more difficult, but I can try. When do you want that done by?\nTUTOR:                   Oh, it’s not urgent. Um I should aim for the\nend of term\n. But in the meantime, I think you should also be thinking about Chapter Two.\nQ29\nSANDY:                   Should I be drafting it already?\nTUTOR:                   No, but I think you should note down its main sections.\nSANDY:                   Yes. You know, I always find that the hardest part.\nTUTOR:                   I always find it helpful to put some ideas on index cards.\nSANDY:                   Yeah.\nTUTOR:                   Um… and then you can sort them, and even lay them out on the floor. It’s a real help.\nSANDY:                   Well, I’ll certainly try it! When would the deadline be for that?\nTUTOR:                 My advice would be to get it done before you embark upon the\nresearch\n. You can always change it later if you need to.\nQ30\nSANDY:                   OK. I’ll get going on that then.\n剑6 test 2 Section 3雅思听力答案\n21. catalogues/catalogs\n22. computer center\n23. checklist\n24. teaching experience\n25. classroom\n26. review\n27. schools\n28. 2000\n29. end of term\n30. research"

Do you know her? She’s in the\nComputer Centre\n答案解析：录音中提到Jane Prince的人名之后，就直接到了答案，将空前提示词head放在了后面。可能会显得有些突然，不过computer centre读的很重，而且单词也比较简单，大多数同学都能写出来。\n第23题答案：checklist\n对应原文：And, of course, the second target was to draw up a survey\nchecklist\nwhich I…\n答案解析：同样采用语序颠倒的手法，不过这道题是把空后的survey提到了答案前面，只要大家读题的时候有注意到这个词，题目反而变得更加简单一些。\n第24题答案：teaching experience\n对应原文：but in section three you really do need to have questions on\nteaching experience\n.\n答案解析：听到提示词section three意识到答案即将出现，空前介词on没有替换，很容易锁定teaching experience。\n第25题答案：classroom\n对应原文：I’m afraid I didn’t manage to get hold of the essays about\nclassroom\nmanagement\n答案解析：题目的出题手法仍然是语序颠倒，将空前的managing放到了答案后面，但因为仍然紧挨着答案，所以锁定位置并不难。难的地方在于classroom中的r出现浊化现象，不太好识别单词。\n第26题答案：review\n对应原文：  Well, I’d go for something like Context\nReview\n答案解析：context完全没有变化，很容易确定答案。唯一的一点难点在于review这个单词可能对于词汇量一般的同学来说不太熟悉。\n第27题答案：schools\n对应原文：I’d be quite interested to have a few more statistics about the\nschools\nin the different zones.\n答案解析：录音中的句子结构与题干相比几乎没有变化，只是将add替换成了a few more而已。再加上schools单词比较简单，题目难度不大。\n第28题答案：2000\n对应原文：I think you should aim to cite more works written later than\n2000\n答案解析：题干中的after在原文中被替换成later than。不过好多同学看题的时候会推测空上填的是具体日期（因为有date），所以听到2000的时候不太敏感，进而错过。\n第29题答案：end of term\n对应原文：it’s not urgent. Um I should aim for the\nend of term\n.\n答案解析：跟上一题一样，主要难点在于读题时推测的误导。不少同学都以为空上填具体的日期或者几点几分，没想到会是个如此模糊的时间点，进而有点反应不过来。\n第30题答案：research\n对应原文：My advice would be to get it done before you embark upon the\nresearch\n.\n答案解析：虽然starting与embark upon的同义替换很多同学都不太清楚，但before原词出现，在加上research有重读，还是比较容易确定答案的。"

To settle the bet, a photographer was asked to photograph a horse galloping and the bet was settled because you could see that\nall the hooves were off the ground in some of the photos\n. What was even more interesting was that if the photos were shown in quick succession the horse looked like it was running – in other words ‘moving pictures’.\nQ31\nThe person who became interested in taking the moving pictures to its next step was the famous American inventor Thomas Edison. Actually, he didn’t do the work himself but rather asked a young Scotsman in his employ to design a system, which he did. Now this young fellow was clever because the first thing he did was study other systems – primitive as they were – of moving pictures and then\nput all the existing technologies together to make the first entire motion picture system\n. He designed a camera, a projection device and the film. The system was first shown in New York in 1894 and was really very popular. Apparently people lined up around the block to see the wonderful new invention. There were, however, a couple of problems with the system.\nThe camera weighed over 200 kilograms\nand only one person at a time could see the film.\nQ32      Q33\nWell now, news of the new system in America travelled fast and\na number of rival European systems started to appear once people had heard about it\n. The single problem with all the systems was they couldn’t really project the film onto a screen – you know, so more than one person could see it.\nThen in 1895, three systems were all developed, more or less at the same time and independently of each other. I guess the most famous of these was by the Lumière Brothers from France\n, and they called their system the cinematographe which of course is where the word cinema comes from. There were also two brothers in Germany who developed a successful system and they called it a bioskop.\nQ34    Q35\nWell now, once the problem of projection had been solved, the next challenge for the inventors was to make the films longer and more interesting. A continuing problem at the time was that the\nfilms had a tendency to break when they were being played – a problem which was caused by the tension between the two wheels, or ‘reels’ as they are called, which hold the film\n.\nNow this problem was solved by two American brothers. They developed the ‘Lantham Loop’, which was the simple addition of a third reel between the two main reels, and\nthis took all the tension away\nwith the result that the film stopped snapping.\nQ36    Q37\nSo now there was a real possibility of having films of more than two or three minutes, and this led to the making of The\nGreat Train Robbery\n– the very first movie made. It only lasted 11 minutes but was an absolute sensation, and there were cases of people watching the movie and actually fainting when the character fired a gun at the camera! Almost overnight movies became a craze, and by 1905 people in America were lining up to see movies in ‘store theatres’, as they were called then.\nQ38\nI guess the next big step in terms of development of technology was to have people actually talking on the film, and the first step towards this was in 1926 when\nsound effects\nwere first used on a film. It wasn’t until the following year however that the first ‘talkie’, as they were called then, was made. This film featured actors speaking only during parts of the film and was called The Jazz Singer, and it wasn’t until 1928 that the first all-talking film was produced, and this was called The Lights of New York. Unfortunately, the sound on this early film was not very good and I believe they put subtitles on the film – that is, they printed the dialogue along the bottom of the film to compensate for this\npoor sound quality\n. Now, with the addition of sound, moving pictures became far more difficult to make…\nQ39  Q40\n剑6 test 2 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31. A\n32. B\n33. C\n34. A\n35. A\n36. C\n37. A\n38. Great Train Robbery\n39.

I guess the most famous of these was by the Lumière Brothers from France\n答案解析：首先，录音中明确提到了independently of each other，即互相独立完成，因此排除选项B。其次，cinema来源于法国人发明的系统，而非德国人，同样排除。因此确定答案为A。\n第36题答案：C\n对应原文：A continuing problem at the time was that the\nfilms had a tendency to break when they were being played – a problem which was caused by the tension between the two wheels, or ‘reels’ as they are called, which hold the film\n.\n答案解析：这道题稍微需要一些背景知识。最起码得了解放映机一般包含两个轮子用于固定胶片，然后就会比较好做一些。听到two wheels即可确定答案。\n第37题答案：A\n对应原文： the simple addition of a third reel between the two main reels, and\nthis took all the tension away\nwith the result that the film stopped snapping\n答案解析：录音中提到的是加了第三个轮子，而非加三个轮子，因此排除B。C选项完全没提到。而A选项中的remove被替换成take away，因此判断答案为A。\n第38题答案：Great Train Robbery\n对应原文：and this led to the making of The\nGreat Train Robbery\n– the very first movie made\n答案解析：解题存在两个障碍。一是题目采用了语序颠倒的出题方式，本应在前面起提示作用的first被放在了答案后面。二是great train robbery作为专有名词，无法根据上下文事先推测含义。所以哪怕不少同学都听到了这一点，却没有识别出具体的词汇。\n第39题答案：Sound effects\n对应原文：and the first step towards this was in 1926 when\nsound effects\nwere first used on a film\n答案解析：答案中sound的尾音d，与effects的首音e发生连读，不太好识别。\n第40题答案：poor sound quality\n对应原文： I believe they put subtitles on the film – that is, they printed the dialogue along the bottom of the film to compensate for this\npoor sound quality\n答案解析：题目存在两个难点，一是说完subtitles这一提示词之后，后面又加了一句解释，导致不少同学错误的以为答案在这一句解释中，进而忽略了后一句。二是好不容易听到答案之后只写了sound quality，漏掉了poor导致扣分。"

We have different types – I see you’ve got our leaflet there.\nPIETER:                   I’ve decided on the one called ‘\nSelect\n.’\nQ1\nWOMAN:                 Right, that’s fine, so, first of all, can I have your full name please?\nPIETER:                   Yes, it’s Pieter Henes.

I think I’ll put that then. It’s shorter! Now we usually ask for a piece of information which we can use to check your identity, for security reasons.

In fact, I wanted to ask you about that.

Um, just a minute, I’d better check. Oh, no sorry, six-one-six\n.\n答案解析：虽然这道题目比较简单，但有一个值得注意的地方。男性在后面进行更正的时候只提到了错误部分，而没有重复完整的数字，寄希望于大家已经遗忘前面的内容。这也是雅思听力Section 1比较常见的出题方式。\n第6题答案：engineer\n对应原文 Well, I’m in Britain as a project manager, but that’s not my main job. I’m an\nengineer\nby profession.\n答案解析：男性进行了自我更正，注意but转折就好。\n第7题答案：mother\n对应原文：\nMother\n‘s might be better. It’s less likely to be known.\n答案解析：男性先询问妻子的可以吗？女性回答说妈妈的更好，因此确定答案为mothers。这种他人更正的模式在Section 1中也十分常见。\n第8题答案：2000\n对应原文：Well, I’m going to transfer\n€2,000\nfrom my Dutch account, just till I get paid.\n答案解析：题干后面有一段补充描述：to be transferred from Fransen Bank。只要注意到这一点就可以很容易排除前面提到的50和75。\n第9题答案：month\n对应原文： Oh, no, that’s too often. Can I have them sent, Mm, once a\nmonth\n?\n答案解析：表示频率说法的同义替换。除此之外，需要注意题干上的statement在这里表示银行对账单，它也算是银行场景中比较经常考察的内容。\n第10题答案：internet\n对应原文： I was thinking of registering for your\ninternet\nservice at some stage.\n答案解析：题目本身没有什么难度，但距离第9题的答案太近。上一题稍加犹豫就会错过。"

He bought the house in 1902 although he had first seen it two years earlier. At that time the owners let it out to a tenant because\nGeorge was too slow making up his mind to buy it\n. When it came back on the market, there was no hesitation and he bought it immediately, for ￡9,300, even though the house had no bathroom, no running water upstairs, and no electricity.\nQ11\nWhen he came here, he’d been married for ten years. During that time, he’d become one of the most famous writers in the English-speaking world. His professional success was enormous, but\nhis personal life wasn’t as successful. He was no longer on speaking terms with his brother and had been devastated by the death at the age of seven of his elder daughter, Josephine\n.\nQ12\nMoving to Rosewood allowed the family to start a new life.\nGeorge regarded Rosewood as a pure example of a traditional country house of this part of England\nand did some of his most successful writing here. The house and its grounds became the family haven and their escape to privacy and quiet. The walls, and the mullioned windows were built of the local sandstone, the tiles on the roofs and the bricks of the chimney stack were baked from local clay, and the wooden structures inside came from oak trees which grow around here.\nQ13\nNow, please look at the map I’ve given you of the house and gardens. We’re here at the Information Centre. Follow the path marked with the arrow and the first area you come to is the orchard on your left.\nAs you go further down the path, there’s the kitchen garden on the right and as you go round the first sharp corner you will find, to your left, an area where different types of pear tree have been planted as well as some lovely flowers, and this is known as\nPear Alley\n-designed by George himself.\nQ14\nNext to this is the greenhouse where some exotic plants and fruits are grown. Follow the path round the second corner and on your right you will see the entrance to the\nMulberry Garden\nwith its 500-year-old tree. Past the Mulberry Garden, follow the path until you reach the front of the house. I suggest you spend a good hour wandering around this lovely building. A guide takes visitor groups round every two hours.\nQ15\nIf you would like to purchase any of George’s books or other souvenirs, then leave the house by the side entrance, where you will find our\nshop\n, which is situated between the house and the garage which contains the magnificent old Rolls-Royce car which used to belong to George. I expect by this time you may also be in need of a rest and some refreshment. Most visitors are, so why don’t you visit\nthe tea room\non the far side of the garage?\nQ16   Q17\nIf you have time, there is a lovely walk down towards the River Dudwell. For me, this is the best part of the estate. This isn’t on the map but it is all clearly signposted. You cross the\nfield\nwhich spreads along the banks of the river. In spring, this area is well worth a visit. Spend a minute or two watching the water pass by underneath as you cross the\nfootbridge\n, and then continue along the River Walk through the woodland. On a hot summer’s day the trees along this path provide welcome shade. Eventually you come to the water mill which used to provide the electricity for the house – only about four hours every evening – in George’s time. And, finally, for those of you who would like to see stunning views of the surrounding countryside and who are a little bit more energetic, when you return from the mill take the first turning on your left and climb up to the\nviewpoint\n. You won’t regret it.\nQ18  Q19  Q20\n剑6 test 3 Section 2雅思听力答案\n11. C\n12. A\n13. C\n14. H\n15. F\n16. B\n17. D\n18. field\n19. footbridge\n20. viewpoint"

He was no longer on speaking terms with his brother and had been devastated by the death at the age of seven of his elder daughter, Josephine\n.\n答案解析：录音中提到，买房子之前，他已经是英语世界最著名的作家之一，因此排除B。C选项完全没有提到。选项A则采用了词义解释的方法，将family problems的具体内容罗列出来，包括不跟兄弟说话，大女儿去世等。\n第13题答案：C\n对应原文：\nGeorge regarded Rosewood as a pure example of a traditional country house of this part of England\n答案解析：录音中虽然提到了B选项中的escape，但说的并不是逃离工作，因此排除。选项A完全没有提到。选项C中的typical与pure example对应，region与country对应，由此确定答案。\n第14题答案：H\n对应原文： as you go round the first sharp corner you will find, to your left, an area where different types of pear tree have been planted as well as some lovely flowers, and this is known as\nPear Alley\n答案解析：解题关键点：first sharp courner（第一个转弯处），to your left（左手边）。\n第15题答案：F\n对应原文：Follow the path round the second corner and on your right you will see the entrance to the\nMulberry Garden\n答案解析：解题关键点：round the second corner（第二个转弯处）\n第16题答案：B\n对应原文：then leave the house by the side entrance, where you will find our\nshop\n, which is situated between the house and the garage\n答案解析：解题关键点：side entrance（侧面入口），situated between the house and the gargage（房子和车库中间）。\n第17题答案：D\n对应原文：Most visitors are, so why don’t you visit\nthe tea room\non the far side of the garage?\n答案解析：解题关键点：far side of the garage（车库远端）。\n第18题答案：field\n对应原文：This isn’t on the map but it is all clearly signposted. You cross the\nfield\nwhich spreads along the banks of the river.\n答案解析：这道题的难点主要在于没有明显的定位词提示大家答案即将到来，只能根据through与cross的同义替换，以及空后的along the river bank来确定答案位置。比较考验听音辨音和短期记忆能力。\n第19题答案：footbridge\n对应原文：Spend a minute or two watching the water pass by underneath as you cross the\nfootbridge\n答案解析：跟上一题一样，同样不存在明显的定位词，只能根据go over和cross的同义替换来定位答案。\n第20题答案：viewpoint\n对应原文：when you return from the mill take the first turning on your left and climb up to the\nviewpoint\n.\n答案解析：相比于前两道题目而言，本题要稍微简单一些。return与way back的同义替换提示大家答案即将到来。up原词出现，确定后面跟着的viewpoint（观景点）即为答案。"

We’ve only got five weeks left to the end of term to design it, carry it out, and then write up the results.\nLUCY:                      Sure. Well, let’s get started right now. Let’s go over the instructions. What exactly do we have to do?\nJACK:                      Well, it says here we have to look at one area of the\nentertainment industry\n. There’s a list of the different types.\nQ21\nLUCY:                      What are they?\nJACK:                      Music, cinema, theatre, sport, and eating out.\nLUCY:                      Is that all?\nJACK:                      Looks like it.\nLUCY:                      So we choose one branch of the industry and then we look at how two different groups of people use it? Is that right?\nJACK:                      Yes.\nLUCY:                      And do we have to use any particular method to get our data? Can we mail out a questionnaire, or do face-to-face interviews, or maybe even observations?\nJACK:                      Well actually, it looks like we don’t have a choice. We have to do\ntelephone interviews\n.\nQ22\nLUCY:                      OK, so at least we don’t have to waste time deciding between the different methods.\nJACK:                      Yeah, that’s right. Oh, and the other requirement is the number of interviewees.\nLUCY:                      Not too many, I hope. Ten? Twenty?\nJACK:                      Well, we have to do two groups, remember, and it looks like we have to interview fifteen for each group.\nLUCY:                      That’s\nthirty\naltogether then. It’s going to take ages.\nQ23\nJACK:                      Yes, but remember we’re working on this together, so we’ll only have to do fifteen each.\nLUCY:                      OK, so those are all the requirements?\nJACK:                      Yes, looks like it.\nLUCY:                      So, first, which area are we going to choose? My preference would be cinema, since that’s where I spend most of my money.\nJACK:                      Hmm, I don’t think that’s such a good idea. I don’t think there are huge differences in the market there. I mean you get young and old, male and female, rich and poor all going to the same movies.\nLUCY:                      Yeah, maybe you’re right. Let’s make it music then.\nJACK:                      Right. So, what two groups will we compare and contrast?\nLUCY:\nMale and female\n?\nQ24\nJACK:                      No. Most of my female friends like the same music as me. Different age groups would be much more likely to show up differences, I think.\nLUCY:                      Yeah, I suppose you’re right again. I’ll take some notes, shall I? So… Age Groups. Well. What do you think? Maybe twenty-five or under for one group, and forty-five or over for the other group? That should show up differences.\nJACK:                      Right.\nLUCY:                      OK. Next. How about the kind of music they like – let’s give them some choices and then we can just tick boxes.\nJACK:                      OK. Let’s have pop,\njazz\n, folk, easy listening… What else?\nQ25\nLUCY:                      Well, we should include\nclassical\n. Some people like it, you know.\nQ26\nJACK:                      OK.

Last week we were looking at the hunter-gatherers in Ireland, across the Irish Sea from England. Today, we’re going to move on to the period between four and six thousand years ago, known as the Neolithic period, which is when a total farming economy was introduced in Ireland.\nNow,\nthere are several hypotheses about the origins of the first Neolithic settlers in Ireland, but most of these contain problems\n. For instance, there are considerable archaeological difficulties about the theory that they came from England. The evidence doesn’t really add up. But there are even greater practical problems about the theory that they came directly from continental Europe. For one thing, it’s not clear just how sufficient numbers of men and women could have been transported to Ireland to establish a viable population. As you know, the hunter-gatherer economy which existed beforehand was based on small scattered groups. The farming economy would almost certainly have required much larger communities to do all the work needed to plant and tend sufficient crops to sustain them through the year.\nQ31\nThe early farmers kept various animals, including cattle and sheep. There’s also evidence of pigs, but it is possible that these could have been descended from the native wild species. Now, we know from modern farming that if the level of breeding stock falls below about three hundred females, the future of the species locally is at risk. So we must assume that\nfrom the beginnings of Neolithic farming the number of breeding sheep would have considerably exceeded three hundred, and the national cattle herd must have been of a similar size\n. The question is how these were brought to the area and where they came from.\nQ32\nIt’s usually suggested that the\nNeolithic settlers used skin-covered boats to transport livestock. But this method would have severely restricted the range of the colonising fleets\n. The sheer volume of animal transport necessary means it’s unlikely that this livestock could have been brought from anywhere further than England.\nQ33\nWhat about crops? Well, two main cereal crops were introduced to Ireland during this time: wheat and barley, both in several varieties.\nThe main evidence for their presence consists of impressions on pottery, where a cereal grain accidentally became embedded in the surface of a pot\nbefore it was fired. The grain itself was destroyed by the firing, but it left an impression on the pot which could be studied and identified by botanists.\nQ34\nLet’s turn our attention now to the farming technology available at that time. Before the cereal crops could be planted, it would have been necessary to clear the forest and to break the ground by ploughing. The stone blade of a plough has been discovered during excavation in County Mayo in western Ireland. The body of the plough would have been of wood and could have been drawn by\npeople\n, but it’s also likely that cattle were used.\nQ35\nNow, the cultivation of crops and the husbandry of livestock brought about changes in people’s lifestyle such as the type of shelters they made. For one thing, instead of moving from place to place they needed permanent dwellings. The stone axes used to chop down trees to make these dwellings were far superior to any that the Stone Age hunter-gatherers used.\nTo make the axes, sources of suitable stone had to be found and systematically exploited. These so-called ‘axe factories’ were really quarries rather than factories, as the manufacture of the axes wasn’t regularly performed on the quarry site. However, after the axe had been chipped into shape, they needed\nwater\nand\nsand\nfor grinding and polishing, so a high mountainside wouldn’t have been an appropriate place for this. So this final stage of the manufacture must have been carried out close to water and sure enough, there’s ample evidence of this at coastal sites.\nQ36\nNow it’s clear that these Neolithic axes were transported all over Ireland, as well as to\nScotland\nand the south of England. It’s not really surprising that axes from ‘axe factories’ in England have also been found in Ireland. At the very least, this indicates that there was a link between the two islands during that period.\nQ37\nOne of the most useful innovations of the colonisers was pottery making, which was quite unknown to Irish hunter-gatherers. The pottery was probably made by shaping clay into a ball with the hand, and then hollowing it until the walls were the right thickness. After firing, the\noutside\nwas often polished. This would have helped the pots to retain water, as they weren’t glazed. Now we know that the clay used usually came from\nlocal\nsources, which suggests that manufacture was on a fairly small scale, even though thousands of fragments are usually found at Neolithic sites.\nQ38    Q39\nIn the course of time decoration began to appear. At first this looked like a series of stitches and was just around the\ntops\nof the\npots\n. This could have been an imitation of earlier vessels which were made of leather sewn onto wood. Then eventually pots with decoration all over…\nQ40\n剑6 test 3 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31. C\n32. A\n33. A\n34. B\n35. people\n36. water sand\n37. Scotland\n38. outside\n39. local\n40. tops"

I know the conference is for three days but actually I want to attend on the Friday and Saturday only. Will that work out to be any cheaper?\nCLERK:                   Let me have a look. Well, you could register for the two days separately, but that wouldn’t actually save you very much as it still costs ￡35 for each day. In fact, if you could register for the three days, you also get an invitation to a free dinner on the Saturday night, so that’s probably the better option.\nWOMAN:                 Right, I’ll do that.

So it’s probably easiest if I pay by cheque. Now then, what else do I need to arrange? Right. How about accommodation?

I’m Jenny Stewart and I’m the Staff Manager here at the exhibition centre. We’re expecting this year’s International Travel Exhibition to attract over 10,000 visitors a day, ladies and gentlemen, and you are among the two hundred extra staff recruited to help look after them. Now, to help things run smoothly, we have divided you into four teams – the blue team, the green team, the red team, and the yellow team. So first I’ll explain how the teams are divided up, and then we’ll be giving you colour-coded T-shirts so we can identify you more easily. First of all, those who will be looking after the phones and handling all calls regarding the exhibition, you will be on the red team.  Now,\nwe’ve also put the entrance staff on the red team and you’ll be stamping the entrance tickets\nand giving out publicity leaflets, OK?\nQ11\nThose of you involved in distributing entrance tickets will be on the yellow team and we’ve also put those of you who’ll be staffing the information booths around the conference centre on the yellow team, so you’ll be getting a yellow T-shirt. Now, most of the hospitality staff have been put in the blue team, so\nthe chefs among you and the kitchen hands will all need a blue T-shirt\n, but, because of the sheer numbers, all waiting staff will be on the yellow team, and this includes the bar staff among you.\nThose who will be monitoring and directing the traffic in the car parks are on the green team\n, so you’ll need to get a green T-shirt. This year we’ve also employed a considerable number of attendants to direct the human traffic around the conference centre. Now, you’ll be working in the exhibition hall at all times, giving directions and generally helping people whenever you can, and you will be in the red team, so please collect a red T-shirt.\nQ12    Q13\nRight, now that everyone knows what team they’re in, we’ll get on with the orientation and training programme and first I’ll run through the rest of today’s programme, which you should have in front of you, so that you can get a general idea of what else is in store today. This introduction finishes at 9.30 and then you’ll be hearing from Anne Smith. Anne works in the accounts department on level two and she looks after all temporary staff, and so she is the person to see if you have any problems regarding pay. Anne will be explaining when and how you get this. She will also be handing out your tax forms. And I will just stress that all\ntax\nforms must be completed and returned to Anne before your pay can be processed. Following Anne’s talk you’ll hear from Peter Chen, our Conference Manager, and he will be going over a plan of the conference centre with you, which will help you to orient yourselves. He will also go through the\nsecurity\narrangements with you and show you the fire exits. Then at 10.30, there will be a coffee break in the staff canteen, which is located down on the\nground floor\n. Now, after the break we’ll be moving to a different location for a video presentation, so instead of coming back here, we’d like you all to go to\nLecture Room three-one-one\n. You’ll find it on this same level, just down the hall, and there you will be shown a video about important safety issues in the workplace, called\nSafety at Work\n.

She will also be handing out your\ntax\nforms.\n答案解析：人名提示大家答案即将到来，通过give out与handing out的同义替换锁定答案位置。难点主要在于一些同学对于tax一词不太熟悉，容易写成text。\n第15题答案：security\n对应原文：He will also go through the\nsecurity\narrangements with you\n答案解析：采用语序颠倒的出题方式，将原本在空前的arrangements放在答案之后，考察大家的短期记忆能力。\n第16题答案：ground floor\n对应原文： there will be a coffee break in the staff canteen, which is located down on the\nground floor\n.\n答案解析：staff canteen提示答案即将出现，根据空前介词on可以锁定gournd floor。这里存在一点文化差异。在英国，ground floor指的其实是1楼，而1楼其实对应我们国内的2楼。大家可以提前熟悉一下。\n第17题答案：lecture room 311\n对应原文：we’ll be moving to a different location for a video presentation, so instead of coming back here, we’d like you all to go to\nLecture Room three-one-one\n答案解析：video presentation提示答案即将出现，go to原词重现，很容易确定答案。Lecture room其实就是教室的意思。\n第18题答案：Safety at Work\n对应原文：you will be shown a video about important safety issues in the workplace, called\nSafety at Work\n.\n答案解析：这道题中有一点小技巧。一般而言，雅思听力中如果问到物品的名称，答案前都会有一个called，可以用它帮助我们确定答案。\n第19题答案：Main hall\n对应原文：and we’ll be serving you a buffet lunch in the\nMain Hall\n答案解析：根据前一单元格中的buffet lunch定位答案所在句子。Hall这个单词因为发音问题，往往会读的比较轻一些，需要额外注意一下。\n第20题答案：team leaders\n对应原文：After lunch you’ll be divided up into your teams to meet your\nteam leaders\n答案解析：虽然前一单元格中的时间提示没有出现，但空前词meet在录音中原词重现，比较容易锁定答案为team leaders。"

Can I help you?\nSTUDENT:               Good afternoon. Yes, I’ve just transferred to the School of Education, and I’d like information about joining the library.\nLIBRARIAN:           Well, the School of Education has libraries on two sites, as I’m sure you know. This one here is the Fordham Site, and the other is on Castle Road.\nSTUDENT:               And is there any difference between the two libraries?\nLIBRARIAN:           Not in terms of their facilities. Access to online databases and the Internet is available at both sites and each site has a range of\nreference\nmaterials on education.\nQ21\nSTUDENT:               Oh yes. I see.\nLIBRARIAN:           But the Castle Road site has books on the sociology of education and a collection of\ntextbooks\nand teaching resources covering most of the subjects taught in\nsecondary\nschools.\nQ22    Q23\nSTUDENT:               Ah, right, but I’m training to be a primary teacher so I need to look at materials for the five to eleven age group.\nLIBRARIAN:           Then you’ve come to the right place. At Fordham we hold material relating to\nprimary\neducation, as well as special needs, but of course you’ll need to familiarise yourself with both sites to make the most of our resources.\nQ24\nSTUDENT:               You haven’t mentioned periodicals. Are they held at both sites?\nLIBRARIAN:           Current issues, yes but if you want to look at\nback\nissues you’ll need to use the CD-ROM databases which are held here at Fordham.\nQ25\nSTUDENT:               I see. Now, about borrowing books. I’m living out of town, so I’m hoping I can borrow quite a few items, and cut down on the number of trips I have to make.\nLIBRARIAN:           Right, well, members can borrow two books at a time from each site.\nSTUDENT:               Only two books?\nLIBRARIAN:           Only two from each site, but that’s four altogether.\nSTUDENT:               Oh I see, and how long can I hang on to them for?\nLIBRARIAN:          The borrowing period is one month, but of course books can be renewed. You can renew any item a maximum of three times.\nSTUDENT:               Do I have to come to the library to do that?\nLIBRARIAN:           No, you can do it by telephone or email, but you can’t renew\noverdue\nbooks this way, only before or on the due date stamped in the book. We’ll need your full name, your borrower number and the name of the site library you borrowed the items from.   Q26\nSTUDENT:               So theoretically I can borrow books for up to three months – is that what you’re saying?\nLIBRARIAN:           Yes, provided they’re not recalled.\nSTUDENT:               So, what happens then?\nLIBRARIAN:           Well, sometimes an item is requested by another borrower, in which case we’d send you a letter, and you’d have to return the book within\nseven working days\n. Don’t forget we’re closed on Sundays.\nQ27\nSTUDENT:               OK.\nSTUDENT:               I expect it’ll take me a while to find what I need. There’s such a lot here.\nLIBRARIAN:           Yes there is, but if you need help getting started, this term we’re running three study skills workshops.\nSTUDENT:               Oh? What are they on?\nLIBRARIAN:           Er, let me see. The first one’s on resources – yes, here it is.\nHow to use the library’s resources. That includes everything, not just the print and technical resources\n.\nQ28/29/30\nSTUDENT:               That sounds useful. Is there anything on using the Internet?\nLIBRARIAN:           Er, let’s see. The one on the Internet for beginners was last term.\nThis term it’s finding research materials online\n.\nQ28/29/30\nSTUDENT:               That sounds interesting too, hm, what’s the last one?\nLIBRARIAN:           It’s a\nworkshop on dissertations\n.\nQ28/29/30\nSTUDENT:\nWhat do you mean – how to write one\n?\nLIBRARIAN:           Er, no\nit’s more to do with academic writing conventions\n, you know -writing a bibliography and how to refer to sources in your text.

And you would be forgiven for thinking this, because in fact most lions do come from Africa. But this hasn’t always been the case. If we go back ten thousand years we would find that there were lions roaming vast sections of the globe. But now, unfortunately, only very small sections of the lions’ former habitat remain.\nMy particular interest is Asiatic lions, which are a sub-species of African lions.\nIt’s almost a hundred thousand years since the Asiatic lions split off and developed as a sub-species\n.\nQ31\nAt one time the Asiatic lion was living as far west as Greece and they were found from there, in a band that spread east through various countries of the Middle East, all the way to India. In museums, you can now see\nGreek coins that have clear images of the Asiatic lion on them\n. Most of them are dated at around 500 B.C.  However,\nEurope saw its last Asiatic lion roaming free two thousand years ago\n. Over the next nineteen hundred years the numbers of Asiatic lions in the other areas declined steadily, but it was only in the nineteenth century that they disappeared from everywhere but India.\nQ32     Q33\nSo, how can you tell an Asiatic lion from an African lion, with which you’re probably more familiar? Well, in general, Asiatic lions are not as big as African lions. The colour is more or less the same, but the appearance of the mane is different – that’s the hair around the lion’s face and neck. The Asiatic lion’s mane is noticeably shorter than the African lion’s.\nAsiatic lions also have a long fold of skin on their undersides, whereas not many African lions have this\n.\nQ34\nWell, I’d like to talk to you now about the Gir Sanctuary in India. That’s where I’ve just come back from. The sanctuary was established specifically to protect the Asiatic lion. It’s\n1,450\nsquare kilometres in area and most of it is forest. There are now around three hundred Asiatic lions in India and almost all of them are in this sanctuary.\nQ35\nBut despite living in a sanctuary, which makes them safe from hunters, they still face a number of problems that threaten their survival. One of these is the ever-present danger of\ndisease\n. This is what killed more than a third of Africa’s Serengeti lions in 1994, and people are fearful that something similar could happen in the Gir Sanctuary and kill off many of the Asiatic lions there.\nQ36\nIndia’s lions are particularly vulnerable because they have a limited gene pool. The reason for this is interesting – it’s because all of them are descended from a few dozen lions that were saved by a\nprince\nwho took a particular interest in them. He was very wealthy, and he managed to protect them – otherwise they’d probably have died out completely.\nQ37\nWhen you see the Asiatic lion in India, what you sense is enormous vitality. They’re very impressive beasts and you would never guess that they had this vulnerability when you look at them.\nThe Asiatic lions don’t have the Gir Sanctuary to themselves, I should add. They actually share it with about two thousand farmers. A significant proportion of the lions’\ndiet\nis made up of the livestock of these farmers – goats, chickens and so on – as much as a third, in fact. And they’ve even been known to\nattack humans\n, especially in times of drought.\nQ38    Q39\nOne final piece of interesting information – in ancient India one of the greatest tests of\nleadership\nfor a man was to fight a lion. Now it seems, in modern India it will be a great test to see if the lion can be saved. I’m sure this is something that all of you will share concern for too.\nQ40\n剑6 test 4 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31. B\n32. A\n33. B\n34. C\n35. 1450\n36. disease 疾病\n37.

How may I help you?\nWOMAN: Oh, good morning. Um, I’m flying to Toronto Airport next week, and I need to get to a town called um, Milton. Could you tell me how I can get there?\nMAN: Milton, did you say? Let me see. I think that’s about 150 miles southwest of here. In fact it’s\n147 miles\nto be exact, so it’ll take you at least – say, three to four hours by road.\nExample\nWOMAN: Wow! Is it as far as that?\nMAN: Yes, I’m afraid so. But you have a number of options to get you there and you can always rent a car right here at the airport, of course.\nWOMAN: Right. Well, I don’t really want to drive myself, so I’d like more information about public transport.\nMAN: OK. In that case the quickest and most comfortable is\na cab\nand of course there are always plenty available. But it’ll cost you. You can also take a Greyhound bus or there’s an Airport Shuttle Service to Milton.\nQ1\nWOMAN: Hmmm, I think for that kind of distance a cab would be way beyond my budget. But the bus sounds OK. Can you tell me how much that would cost?\nMAN: Sure. Let’s see, that would be $15 one way, or $27.50 return… that’s on the Greyhound.\nWOMAN: Oh, that’s quite cheap – great! But whereabouts does it stop in Milton?\nMAN: It goes directly from the airport here to the\nCity Centre\nand it’s pretty fast. But you have to bear in mind that there is only one departure a day, so it depends what time your flight gets in.\nQ2\nWOMAN: Oh, of course. Hang on, we’re due to get there at 11.30 am.\nMAN: Hmmm, too bad, the bus leaves at 3.45,\nso you would have quite a wait\n– more than 4 hours.\nQ3\nWOMAN: Oh, I see. Well, what about the Shuttle you mentioned?\nMAN: OK. That’s the Airport Shuttle that will take you from the airport right to your hotel or private address.\nIt’s a door-to-door service\nand it would suit you much better, because there’s one every two hours.\nQ4\nWOMAN: So how much does that cost?\nMAN: Let’s see. Yeah, that’s $35 one way, $65 return, so I guess it’s a bit more expensive than the Greyhound.\nWOMAN: Oh, that doesn’t sound too bad, especially if it’ll take me straight to the hotel.\nMAN: But you do need to\nreserve a seat\n.\nQ5\nWOMAN: OK, is it possible to make a booking right now? Through you?\nMAN: Sure.\nMAN: OK, I just have to fill this form out for you. So what date do you want to book this for?\nWOMAN: The 16th of October – oh, no, sorry, that’s my departure date.\nI arrive on the 17th\n, so book it for then, please.\nQ6\nMAN: So, that’s the Toronto Airport Shuttle to Milton. And this is for just one person or…?\nWOMAN: Yes, just me, please.\nMAN: Right. And you said your expected time of arrival was 11.30? So if I book your Shuttle for after 12.00 – let’s say,\n12.30\n: that should give you plenty of time to, you know, collect your baggage, maybe grab a coffee?\nQ7\nWOMAN:\nYeah, that sounds fine\n, as long as we land on time!\nMAN: Well, we’ll take your flight details so you don’t need to worry too much about that. Now, what about the fare? What sort of ticket do you want?

In that case the quickest and most comfortable is\na cab\n答案解析：题目难点主要在cab一词上。它是美式出租车的说法，对应英式的taxi。不过也有部分同学根据题干中的expensive，以及原文中提到的quickest and most comfortable推测出空上应该填出租车。\n第2题答案：city center\n对应原文： It goes directly from the airport here to the\nCity Centre\n答案解析：从题干中可以推测空上填的应该是个地点，direct几乎原词出现，很容易确定答案为city center.\n第3题答案：wait\n对应原文：Hmmm, too bad, the bus leaves at 3.45,\nso you would have quite a wait\n– more than 4 hours\n答案解析：这道题较难，根据题干可以来自老烤鸭雅思实现推测空上应该填时间或者旅程。但听得时候发现并没有特别对应的东西，而且long与quite的对应也不太好识别，只能根据词性和重读来筛选答案。\n第4题答案：door-to-door\n对应原文：\nIt’s a door-to-door service\nand it would suit you much better, because there’s one every two hours.\n答案解析：service原词出现，很容易确定答案为door-to-door。因为这三个词合起来修饰service，因此中间的连字符必不可少。\n第5题答案：reserve (a seat)\n对应原文：But you do need to\nreserve a seat\n答案解析：雅思听力在考到交通方式的时候很喜欢在最后强调一下需要预定座位，所以大家要特别熟悉下这个短语。\n第6题答案：17th (of) October\n对应原文：The 16th of October – oh, no, sorry, that’s my departure date.\nI arrive on the 17th\n, so book it for then, please.\n答案解析：录音中说干扰项的时候提到了具体月份，但在后面真正说答案的时候则将月份忽略。这也是Section 1中日期的一种很常见考法。大家要注意一下。\n第7题答案：12.30\n对应原文：So if I book your Shuttle for after 12.00 – let’s say,\n12.30\n答案解析：前面提到了11.30作为干扰项。但它有两个错误，一是采用疑问语气，听到的时候就要多留个心眼。二是题干中有pm的限定，而11.30还是早上。所以要继续往下听，进而确定答案是12.30。\n第8题答案：Thomson\n对应原文：No, it’s\nT-H-O-M-S-O-N\n答案解析：常见的姓名拼写的考察。不过由于说话人是澳大利亚口音，m和n的发音跟平时不太一样，需要适应一下。\n第9题答案：AC936\n对应原文： it’s Air Canada flight number\nAC936\n答案解析：字母与数字的混合考法。常见的考察同样知识点的还有邮编、车牌和订单号。\n第10题答案：3303 8450 2045 6837\n对应原文：Yes, it’s a VISA card, and the number is\n3303 8450 2045 6837\n答案解析：单纯的考察数字而已，只不过因为数字较长，很容易中间中断。"

It’s nice to see so many people in the audience. For those of you who don’t know very much about PS Camping, let me start by giving you some background information about the company.\nThe company started twenty-five years ago. It actually opened as a retail chain selling camping equipment, and\nthen twenty years ago, it bought a small number of campsites in the UK, and began offering camping holidays\n. The company grew rapidly and has been providing holidays in continental Europe for the last fifteen years.\nQ11\nIf you book a camping holiday with us, you’ll have a choice of over three hundred sites. In Italy we now have some 64 sites that we either own, or have exclusive use of.\nFrance is where we have the majority of sites\n, and we currently have a project to expand into Switzerland. We also have a number of sites in Northern Spain, particularly in the mountainous region of Picos de Europa. We’ve upgraded all these Spanish sites, and improved them considerably from their original three-star rating.\nQ12\nWe believe our holidays offer superb facilities for the whole family. Parents who want their children to be fully occupied for all or part of the day can take advantage of our children’s activities. These are organised by our well-qualified and enthusiastic staff. Each day kicks off with a sports match, perhaps football, or volleyball,\nfollowed by an hour of drama\nfor everyone. This may include singing or dancing, mime or other activities. In the afternoon, there’s a different art activity for each day of the week including a poster competition or model making. What’s more, our sites are truly child-friendly, and, with this in mind, we operate a no-noise rule in the evenings. Children’s evening activities usually finish at 9.30, or occasionally 10, and\nfrom 10.30 holiday-makers are expected to be quiet\nin the areas where there are tents.\nQ13 Q14\nWe want nothing to go wrong on a PS Camping holiday, but if it does, we also want all customers to be insured. If you haven’t organised an annual insurance policy of your own you’ll need to take out the low-cost cover we offer and\nwe require that you arrange this when you make your holiday reservation\n.\nQ15\nThere are many advantages to choosing PS Camping, and to recommending it to others. As a regular customer, you’ll be kept informed of special offers, and your friends can benefit from ten per cent off their holiday, or book a luxury tent for the price of a standard one. In return, we’ll send you\na thank-you present\n, which you can choose from a list of high-quality items.\nQ16\nWhen it comes to our tents, these are equipped to the highest standard. We really do think of every essential detail, from an oven and cooking rings fuelled by bottled gas, to mirrors in the bedroom areas. If you don’t want to cook indoors,\nyou can borrow a barbecue if you ask\nin advance for one to be made available, and there’s even a picnic blanket to sit on outside your tent.\nInside, a box of games and toys can be found\n, and children’s tents can be hired if required. All tents have a fridge, and if you want to spend the day on the beach, for example,\nask for a specially designed PS Camping cool box\n, which will keep your food and drinks chilled. There are excellent washing facilities at all our sites, with washing machines and clothes lines\nin the central areas, along with mops and buckets\nin case your tent needs cleaning during your stay. All sites have a cafe and/or a shop for those who’d rather ‘eat in’ than dine at a local restaurant.\nQ17 Q18\nQ19 Q20\n剑7 test 1 Section 2雅思听力答案\n11. B\n12. A\n13. B\n14. C\n15. C\n16. A\n17. C\n18.

How’s the research going, Philip?\nPHILIP: Well, I’ve been looking at why individualism, I mean individual differences, are such an important area of management studies. When you think about any organization, be it a family business or a multinational company, they are all fundamentally a group of people working together. But it’s what these individuals contribute to their places of work that makes you realize how important they are. Of course they bring different ideas,\nbut it’s also their attitudes\nand their experiences of learning. Diversity is important in these areas too.\nQ21\nTUTOR: So why do people behave so differently from one another at work?\nPHILIP: There are lots of reasons but research has shown a lot of it comes down to personality. And the other factor is\ngender\n. It’s a well known fact that men and women do lots of things in different ways, and the workplace is no different.\nQ22\nTUTOR: Did you look at the effects of this variation on companies?\nPHILIP: Yes, I did. On the positive side, exposure to such diversity helps\nencourage creativity\nwhich is generally an asset to a company. But unfortunately individual differences are also the root of conflict between staff and they can lead to difficulties for management, which can sometimes be serious.\nQ23\nTUTOR: Thanks, Philip. So now I guess the two main things to remember here are to identify individual talent and then to utilize it. So Janice, you were looking at identifying different talents in workers. Do you think this is easy for managers to do?\nJANICE: Well, currently teamwork is in fashion in the workplace and in my opinion the importance of the individual is generally neglected. What\nmanagers should be targeting is those employees who can take the lead in a situation\nand are not afraid to accept the idea of responsibility.\nQ24\nTUTOR: That’s true Janice but unfortunately many managers think the entire notion of encouraging individuality amongst their staff is far too hard.\nJANICE: Yes, that may be true but I think one of the most important tasks of managers is\nto consider the needs of the individual on one hand and group co-operation and conformity on the other\n. It requires creative thinking on the part of management to avoid tension.\nQ25\nTUTOR: So Janice, what kind of people do you think companies should be looking for?\nJANICE: Well, it has to start from the very beginning when companies are looking for new employees. When the personnel department is choosing between applicants they need to look for someone who’s broken the mould and\ncan think for themselves\n. Instead, people making these decisions often use a range of psychological tests to see if a person is a problem solver, or will do as they’re told. I’m not convinced these qualities are actually the most important.\nQ26\nTUTOR: So do you think being a good team player is overrated?\nJANICE: No, it’s not overrated. You do need to learn the rules and learn them fast. No individual can get around this if you’re working in an organization.\nTUTOR: So how should managers deal with this?\nJANICE: Rewards. When an individual demonstrates the behaviour the organisation expects, some kind of incentive can be given. What’s important here is that\nthis happens right at the beginning\nso new recruits learn the rules of the system immediately. Also the incentive should be something the individual actually wants, and this isn’t always just money.\nQ27\nTUTOR: To come back to you, Philip. You were saying that recognition of good performers is essential. What else should managers be looking for?\nPHILIP: Well, managing people means you not only have an understanding of your employees, but you also\nrecognise the culture\nof the organization. In fact, for some organizations creativity and individuality may be the last thing they want to see during working hours!\nQ28\nTUTOR: Very true.\nPHILIP: Yes, but managing people isn’t as easy as it looks. For example, change in the workplace can be quite tricky, especially if there’s a need to increase profit. And at times like these managers may have to give\npriority to profit\nrather than individual staff needs.\nQ29\nTUTOR: Yes, and that creates difficult situations for people.\nPHILIP: Yes but what’s important is that managers are able to deal with quite high levels of\npersonal stress\nQ30\n. During times of change they should be thinking not only about the strain on their staff but take time out to think of themselves.\nTUTOR: Absolutely.

First in this seminar, I’m going to give a brief introduction to contemporary research on rock art, and in the second part I’m going to give you some do’s and don’ts for our fieldwork trip\nin April\n– so please listen very carefully.\nQ31\nI’m first going to focus on the interpretation of rock art in Namibia. We are very fortunate to be going to an area where you can find some of the most important sites in the entire world. And I hope to show you how easy it is for everyone to make mistakes in looking at cultures which are different from our own – the first and most important lesson we have to learn.\nIn Namibia there are both paintings and engravings – that’s where the surface of the rock is cut out. Many of the engravings show footprints of animals and most scholars used to think that the purpose of these was simple and obvious: this rock art was like a school book with pictures\nto teach children about tracks\n: which track belonged to which animal – giraffe, lion and so on.\nQ32\nBut there were some mysteries. First, when you look at a typical Namibian painting or engraving,\nyou see the tracks are repeated\n, there are dozens of tracks for the same animal. You’d expect just one clear illustration if the reason – the aim  was to teach tracking. Now there were two more problems. Why are some of the engravings of animals very accurate as you’d expect – all clearly identifiable  and others quite unrealistic?\nQ33\nAnd another mystery – some of these unrealistic animals – that’s in the engravings seem to be\nhalf human\n. Some, for example, have got human faces. Many researchers now think that these were pictures the wise men engraved of themselves.\nThey believed they could use magic to control the animals\nthey had drawn, so the hunters could then catch them for food.\nQ34 Q35\nThis shows you some of the dangers of coming from one culture to another, as we’ll be doing, without understanding it fully. Scholars imagined that children looked at rock art pictures to learn to track -just because they themselves had learnt skills from pictures; many researchers now believe that rock art had a much more complex purpose. And we’ll talk more about it next week!\nNow before I invite you to join in a discussion in this second part of the seminar, I’d like to make some very important points about our fieldwork – and in fact any field trip to look at rock art.\nWe’re going to a number of sites, and we won’t always be together. The single largest problem faced by people who manage the sites is – yes, I’m sure you’ve guessed – damage caused by visitors, even though it’s usually unintentional.\nWhenever you do go to a site, don’t forget you can learn many things from\nobserving at a distance\ninstead of walking all over it. This can really help to reduce visitor pressure. People often say, ‘Well, there’s only two of us and just this one time’, but maybe thousands of people are saying the same thing.\nQ36\nAnd then some basic rules to guide you – we’ll have our own camp near a village, but remember never to camp on a site if you go on your own. It may be disrespectful to the\npeople of that culture\n, and certainly don’t make\nfires\n, however romantic it may seem. It’s really dangerous in dry areas, and you can easily burn priceless undiscovered material by doing so.\nQ37 Q38\nSo, how are we going to enjoy the rock art on our field trip? By looking at it, drawing it and photographing it –\nNEVER by touching\nit or even tracing it. Rock art is fragile and precious.\nQ39\nRemember that climbing on rocks and in caves can destroy in a moment what has lasted for centuries. So no heroics in Namibia, please! Try to be extra careful and help others to be too.\nAnd lastly please don’t even move rocks or branches to take photographs –\nyou should leave the site intact\n– I’m sure I can rely on you to do that.\nQ40\nWell, that’s about all I want to say before today’s first discussion, but if you have any questions please ask them now – and don’t forget you’ll find some fascinating information about world-wide sites on the Internet.

They believed they could use\nmagic\nto control the animals\n答案解析：这道题的关键在于对题干中with的理解，如果事先猜到它在这里表示“使用”的意思，那么很容易锁定magic，如果事先没有猜到，则只能根据wise men的提示，利用词性来确定答案。\n第36题答案：distance\n对应原文：Whenever you do go to a site, don’t forget you can learn many things from\nobserving at a distance\ninstead of walking all over it.\n答案解析：缺乏明显的定位词，只能根据observe与look at的同义替换，以及它们与空存在的修饰关系确定答案。\n第37题答案：culture\n对应原文：but remember never to camp on a site if you go on your own. It may be disrespectful to the\npeople of that culture\n答案解析：听到camp on a site意识到答案即将到来，people直接原词出现，比较容易确定后面跟着的culture为答案。\n第38题答案：fire(s)\n对应原文： certainly don’t make\nfires …\nIt’s really dangerous in dry areas, and you can easily burn priceless undiscovered material by doing so.\n答案解析：这道题难度较大，一方面答案与上一题距离较近，稍加犹豫就容易错过，另一方面空前词damaged的对应在录音中答案后隔了一句才出现。只能凭借对原文句子意思的理解和短期记忆来确定答案。\n第39题答案：touching\n对应原文：By looking at it, drawing it and photographing it –\nNEVER by touchin\ng\nit or even tracing it.\n答案解析：与之前题目类似，同样没有明显的提示词，只能根据never与avoid的同义替换来寻找答案。\n第40题答案：intact\n对应原文：\nyou should leave the site inta\nct\n– I’m sure I can rely on you to do that.\n答案解析：同样不存在明显的提示词，但好在空前词leave原词出现，可以帮助我们确定答案。"

At Stop A, if you have time, you can visit the fine 16th century palace here built for the king with its beautiful\nformal gardens\n. It’s very near the booking office. Now you can enjoy every corner of this superb residence.\nQ13 Q14\nStop B Why don’t you visit\nTower Restaurant\nwith its wide range of refreshments? This is a place where you can sit and enjoy the wonderful\nviews\nover the old commercial and banking centre of the city.\nQ15 Q16\nStop C is the area where, in the first century AD, invading soldiers crossed the river; this was much shallower than it is now. That’s why this area is called Roman Landing. There’s an interactive Museum to visit here with a large shop which has a good range of\nlocal history books\n.\nQ17\nAt the furthest point of the trip, stop D, the most exciting place to visit is the new Entertainment Complex with\nseven-screen cinema\n, bowling alley and video games arcade.\nQ18\nBesides the boat tours, there are city buses.

Why Christchurch? Was it because of the climate?\nDOCTOR: Well actually New Zealand\nis the second closest country to Antarctica\nand Christchurch is often used on Antarctic expeditions.\nQ21\nINTERVIEWER:\nRight, so it’s because of where we are\n… coupled with our historical role. So tell us – what is the main purpose of the centre?\nDOCTOR: Well… we have two complementary roles. One is as a scientific base for expeditions and research and the other is as an information centre.\nINTERVIEWER: Tell us something about the role as a scientific base.\nDOCTOR: We’re able to provide information\nabout what scientists should take\nwith them to the South Pole – for example, the centre contains a clothing warehouse where expeditions are supplied with suitable clothing for the extreme conditions.\nQ22\nINTERVIEWER: I suppose you need a bit more than your normal winter coat!\nDOCTOR: Yes, exactly and then there’s also the specialist library and mapping services.\nINTERVIEWER: Right. And which countries are actually located at the centre?\nDOCTOR: Well… the centre houses research programmes for New Zealand, for The United States as well as for Italy… there’s even a US post office at the American airforce base here.\nINTERVIEWER: Really? And what does the visitor’s centre offer?\nDOCTOR: Well, since very few people will ever experience the Antarctic first hand,\nthe visitors’ centre aims to recreate the atmosphere of Antarctica\n. There’s a mock camp site where you can see inside an Antarctic tent and imagine yourself sleeping there. And the centre also acts as a showcase for the unique international co-operation which exists in Antarctica today.\nQ23\nINTERVIEWER: What is it actually like at the South Pole? I know you’ve been there on a number of occasions.\nDOCTOR: Yes, I have and each time\nI’m struck by the awesome beauty\nof the place. It’s magnificent but you can really only visit it in the summer months.\nQ24\nINTERVIEWER: October to March.\nDOCTOR: Yes, because it’s completely dark for four months of the year (pause)… and in addition it has to be the coldest place on earth.\nINTERVIEWER: Colder than the North Pole? Why’s that?\nDOCTOR: Well, unlike the North Pole, which is actually a frozen sea,\nAntarctica is a land mass shaped like a dome\n, with the result that the winds blow down the slopes at speeds of up to 150 km an hour and that’s what makes it so cold. And one other interesting thing is that Antarctica is the driest continent on earth, surprisingly, and so you have to drink large amounts of water when you’re there.\nQ25\nINTERVIEWER: How old is Antarctica?\nDOCTOR: We’re pretty sure it was part of a larger land mass but it broke away from the rest of the continent 170 million years ago.\nINTERVIEWER: How can you be certain of this?\nDOCTOR:\n… because fossils and rocks have been discovered in Antarctica\nwhich are the same as those found in places such as Africa and Australia.\nQ26\nINTERVIEWER: Amazing… To think that it was once attached to Africa…\nINTERVIEWER: Now let’s just have a look at the Antarctic Treaty. How far back does the idea of an international treaty go?\nDOCTOR: Well, as far back as the 19th century, when eleven nations organised an international event.\nINTERVIEWER: When was that exactly?\nDOCTOR: In 1870. And it was called the Polar Research Meeting. And then, not long after that, they organised something called the First International Polar Year.\nINTERVIEWER: And that took place when exactly?\nDOCTOR:\nOver two years from 1882 to 1883\n. But it wasn’t until the 1950s that the idea of an international treaty was proposed. And in\n1959 the Treaty was actually signed\n.\nQ27 Q28\nINTERVIEWER: What do you see as the main achievements of the treaty?\nDOCTOR: Well, firstly it means that the continent\nis reserved for peaceful use\n.\nQ29\nINTERVIEWER: That’s Article 1, isn’t it?\nDOCTOR: Yes…\nINTERVIEWER: That’s important since the territory belongs to everyone.\nDOCTOR: Yes but not as important as Article 5,\nwhich prohibits any nuclear explosions or waste disposal\n.\nQ30\nINTERVIEWER: Which is marvellous. Well, I’m afraid we’re going to have to stop there because I’m afraid we’ve run out of time. Thanks for coming along today and telling us all about the centre and its work.\n剑7 test 2 Section 3雅思听力答案\n21. B\n22. A\n23. C\n24. B\n25. A\n26. B\n27. 1882-1883\n28. signed\n29-30. AD"

I’m left-handed myself and I actually didn’t see any relevance to my own life when I happened to start reading an article by a sports psychologist called Peter Matthews. He spent the first part of the article talking about handedness in music instead of sport, which I have to say almost put me off from reading further. But what I soon became struck by\nwas the sheer volume\nof both observation and investigation he had done in many different sports and I felt persuaded that what he had to say would be of real interest. I think Matthews’ findings will be beneficial, not so much in helping sportspeople to work on their weaker side, but more that they\ncan help them\nidentify the most suitable strategies to use in a given game. Although most trainers know how important handedness is, at present they\nare rather reluctant to make use of the insights\nscientists like Matthews can give, which I think is rather short-sighted because focusing on individual flexibility is only part of the story.\nQ31 Q32 Q33\nAnyway, back to the article.\nMatthews found a German study which looked at what he called ‘mixed-handedness’, that is, the capacity to use both left and right hands equally. It looked at mixed-handedness in 40musicians on a variety of instruments. Researchers examined a number of variables, e.g. type of instrument played, regularity of practice undertaken and length of time playing instrument… and found the following: keyboard players had high levels of mixed-handedness, whereas string players like cellists and violinists strongly favoured one hand. Also those who\nstarted younger were more mixed-handed\n.\nQ34\nMatthews also reports studies of handedness in apes. Apes get a large proportion of their food by ‘fishing’ ants from ant hills. The studies show that apes, like humans, show handedness – though for them right- and left-handedness is about equal, whereas about 85%of humans are right-handed. Studies showed\nthat apes consistently using the same hand fished out 30% more ants\nthan those varying between the two.\nQ35\nMatthews started researching several different sports and found different types of handedness in each. By the way, he uses ‘handedness’. to refer to the dominant side for feet and eyes as well as hands. Anyway, his team measured the hand, feet and eyes of 2,611 players and found that there were really three main types of laterality: mixed – you work equally well on both sides – both hand and eye; single – you tend to favour one side but both hand and eye favour the same side; and cross-laterality – a player’s hands and eyes favour only one side but they are opposite sides. Let’s start with hockey. Matthews found that it was best to be mixed-handed – this is because a hockey stick must be deployed in\ntwo directions\n– it would be a drawback to have hand or eye favouring one side. An interesting finding is that mixed-handed hockey players were significantly\nmore confident\nthan their single-handed counterparts. Things are slightly different in racket sports like tennis. Here the important thing is to have the dominant hand and eye on the one side. This means that there is\na bigger area of vision\non the side where most of the action occurs. If a player is cross lateral the racket is invisible from the dominant eye for much of the swing. It means that they\ncan only make corrections\nmuch later… and often the damage has been done by then.\nQ36 Q37 Q38 Q39\nAnd moving to a rather different type of sport which involves large but precise movements gymnastics. It’s been found that cross hand-eye favouring is best. The predominant reason for this is\nbecause it aids balance\n– which is of course absolutely central to performance in this sport.\nQ40\n剑7 test 2 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31. C\n32. B\n33. C\n34. A\n35.

Here’s my student card.\n答案解析：这道题需要注意的主要是答案的写法。在雅思听力section1考到专业时，录音中往往都会带上studies一词。这时候我们即可以写也可以不写。但写的话一定要注意studies是复数。\n第2题答案：third\n对应原文：I’ve been at uni for four years but I’m\nin the Third Year\nbecause I took last year off.\n答案解析：同样需要注意答案的写法，third或者3rd都可以。但这里就不能像日期中一样省略后面的rd，直接写3。\n第3题答案：Sport(s) Center\n对应原文：There’s a job working at the reception desk\nat the Sports Centre\n, for three evenings a week\n答案解析：虽然答案里s加了括号，但老烤鸭小编还是劝大家在听到sports center的时候把它加上去。这个sports在这里并不表示复数，而是sport的形容词形式。\n第4题答案：cleaner\n对应原文： There’s a position\nfor a cleaner\nat the Child Care Centre\n答案解析：没有什么太大的难度，不过需要注意表头问的是position available，即要填一个职位，不要被前面的cleaning给迷惑了。\n第5题答案：library\n对应原文： there was a position going in the Computer Lab. for three days a week that might be OK. Ah, here it is! No,\nit’s in the Library\n, not the Lab\n答案解析：一个很简单的自我更正，先说lab，后面又改成library。只要大家听的时候稍微细心一些就不会出错。\n第6题答案：international house\n对应原文： I’m in one of the Halls of Residence for post-graduate students, you know,\nInternational House\n答案解析：答案比较明显，一些同学可能会受到前面halls of residence的干扰，但一方面它是复数（一个人不可能同时住两个地方），另一方面它也不够具体，因此排除，选择后面的international house。\n第7题答案：B659\n对应原文：Room B569 – no sorry\nB659\n.\n答案解析：简单的自我更正，注意前面的字母B即可。\n第8题答案：(an) office assistant\n对应原文：There is a position for an\nOffice Assistant\nat the English Language Centre.\n答案解析：定位到答案位置并不难，但office和assistant之间出现了连读，导致一些同学无法分辨具体的单词，如果出现这种情况的话，可以多做做\n精听\n。\n第9题答案：answer (the) phone\n对应原文：It says here that you’ll be required to deal with student enquiries and\nanswer the phone\n.\n答案解析：考察工作职责。剑桥雅思9Test1 Section1中又考察了一次这一工作内容，所以大家务必要熟悉下该短语。\n第10题答案：11.30\n对应原文：Not a problem. How about\neleven thirty\n? Hope it works out for you Anita.\n答案解析：经过几次商讨才确定的具体时间，不过没有太过迷惑的干扰项，只要能听清楚数字就没问题。"

I’m very pleased to have been invited along to your club to talk about our Charity Sponsored Walking Holiday for Education Aid. I’ll start by giving you a brief overview of what it entails. First of all, let me explain what we mean by ‘sponsored’ here. This is where people promise to donate money to the charity if you achieve your goal, in this case, to walk a certain number of miles.\nBasically we are organizing a ten-day holiday, from the sixth to the sixteenth of November, with\neight days actual walking\n, trekking in the Semira Mountains.\nQ11\nLet’s have a look at some of the details. We require you to raise sponsorship money of at least $3,200, paying $250 of it upfront as a deposit and the rest in stages throughout the year. Out of this about thirty-five percent will go on your expenses, and that leaves\nsixty-five percent\nguaranteed to go to the charity.\nQ12\nWhich brings me to the most important part. This trek is being specifically organized to help education in the Semira region. Last year we helped train teachers for the disabled, and this year we’re focusing on the pupils.\nEach of the walkers’ sponsorship money will go to help an individual special needs pupil\nin one of the mountain schools. In the second part of the talk I’ll be giving you a lot more details, but back to the basic information.\nQ13\nAge limits. This is the second time we have run this kind of holiday and um, on the first we even had an eighty-year old, but we found it was wise to establish limits this time. You have to be at least eighteen and the top limit is now seventy, though you need to obtain a health certificate from your doctor if you are over sixty years old.\nNow, the Semira Mountains are among the highest in the world but you mustn’t be too daunted, we will mainly be trekking in the foothills only, although there will be spectacular views even in the foothills. However,\nyou will need to be extremely fit\nif you aren’t now and you’re interested in coming with us. You have plenty of time to get into shape. You will be sleeping in tents so you must have quite a bit of equipment with you but you will be helped by local assistants. Your bedding and so forth will be carried by them. We ask that you\nonly walk with a small rucksack with needs for the day\n.\nQ14 Q15\nI don’t think I’ve really said enough about the marvelous area you’ll be walking in. Let’s have a look at some of the sights you’ll be seeing. Apart from these spectacular snow-covered peaks and valleys, there are marvelous historic villages. The area has been famous for centuries\nfor making beautiful carpets\n, although recently there has been a trend to move into weaving blankets and wood carving. The people are extremely friendly and welcoming. We deliberately keep the parties small in size to minimize disruption to people and landscape.\nQ16\nI hope that there are still some people interested. I will be distributing leaflets at the end where you can find out more information, but just for the moment I’ll outline the itinerary, the main high points of the holiday. Obviously, you’ll start by flying out to Kishba, the capital city, on Day One. After a couple of days to acclimatize yourself, you’ll start the trek on Day Three\nwalking through the enormous Katiba Forest\nwhich will take the whole of the day. Day Four takes us higher up, going through the foothills past a number of villages and visiting a school for the disabled in Sohan. Then you have a rest day, that’s Day Five, before\ngoing to the spectacular Kumi Temple\nwith twelfth-century carvings, set in a small forest by a lake and that’s Day Six, the highlight for many. We stay near there for Day Seven because then comes the hardest day, walking through very mountainous country, but culminating in a\nswim in the Parteh Falls. This is the highest waterfall\nin the region. Day Nine is much easier, with part of the day spent\nin a village\nwhere they make some of the gorgeous red blankets. Then back down to Kishba and the journey home.\nQ17 Q18 Q19 Q20\nSo you can see it’s a pretty packed timetable…\n剑7 test 3 Section 2雅思听力答案\n11. B\n12. C\n13. A\n14. C\n15. B\n16.

This is the highest waterfall\nin the region.\n答案解析：这道题有一定的难度，虽然根据swim很容易定位到具体的句子。但不少同学的注意力都会被Parteh Fall吸引过去，认为它是答案，进而忽略了后面的waterfall。\n第20题答案：village\n对应原文：Day Nine is much easier, with part of the day spent\nin a village\n答案解析：与第17题类似，听到Day 9意识到答案即将到来，根据题干可以推测空上应该填的是个地点，由此锁定village。"

Well, first of all, we’ll look at what a robotic float does and its use. So let’s start with the device itself. It looks a bit like a\ncigar\nand it’s about one and a half meters long. More importantly, it’s full of equipment that’s designed to collect data. So, it can help us in building up a profile of different factors which work together within the world’s oceans.\nQ21\nSTUDENT I: Sounds like a big project – isn’t it too big for one country to undertake?\nSIMON: That’s quite true but this project is a really good example of international co-operation. Over the last five years scientists from\nthirteen countries\nhave been taking part in the project and launching floats in their area of ocean control. And next year this number will rise to fourteen when Indonesia joins the project.\nQ22\nSTUDENT 2: That’s impressive.\nSIMON: But let’s move onto how floats work.\nSIMON: The operational cycle goes like this. Each of the floats is dropped in the ocean from a boat at a set point and\nactivated\nfrom a satellite. Then the float immediately sinks about 2,000 meters… that’s two whole kilometers down in the water. It stays at this depth for about 10days and is carried around by the currents which operate in the ocean at this level. During this time it’s possible for it to cover quite large distances but the average is\nfifty kilometers\n.\nQ23 Q24\nSTUDENT 2: So what is it actually recording?\nSIMON: Well at this stage nothing, but as it rises to the surface it collects all sorts of data, most importantly variations in salinity, that’s salt levels, and the changes in\ntemperature\n, a bit like underwater weather balloons. Then when it gets back to the surface all the data it’s collected is beamed up to the satellite. After about five hours on the surface, the float automatically sinks, beginning the whole process again.\nQ25\nSTUDENT I: What happens to the data?\nSIMON: Well the information is transferred direct to onshore meteorological stations… like our one in Hobart… and within four hours the findings can be on computers and they can be mapped and analysed.\nSTUDENT 2: You say you’re building models of the world’s ocean systems but how’re they going to be used, and more importantly, when?\nSIMON:\nSome of the data has already helped in completing projects. For example, our understanding of the underlying causes of El Niño\nevents is being confirmed by float data. Another way we’re using float data is to help us to\nunderstand the mechanics of climate change, like global warming and ozone depletion. That’s part of an ongoing variability study but the results are still a long way off\n.\nQ26 Q27\nHowever, this is not the case with our ocean weather forecasting. Because we know from the floats what the prevailing weather conditions will be in certain parts of the ocean, we can advise the navy\non search and rescue missions. That’s happening right now\nand many yachtsmen owe their lives to the success of this project. In addition, the float data can help us to look at the biological implications of ocean processes.\nQ28\nSTUDENT 1 : Would that help\nwith preserving fish stocks\n?\nQ29\nSIMON: Yes, and advising governments on fisheries legislation. We’re well on the way to completing a project on this. We hope it will help to bring about more\nsustainable fishing practices. We’ll be seeing the results of that quite soon\n.\nSTUDENT 2: It sounds like the data from floats has lots of applications.\nSIMON: Yes it does. It’s also a powerful agricultural tool. If we were aware of what the weather would be like, say, next year, we could make sure that the farmers planted appropriate grain varieties to produce the best yield from the available rainfall. STUDENT I: That sounds a bit like science fiction, especially when now we can’t even tell them when a drought will break.\nSIMON: I agree that this concept\nis still a long way in the future\n, but it will come eventually and the float data will have made a contribution.\nQ30\n剑7 test 3 Section 3雅思听力答案\n21. cigar\n22. 13 countries\n23. activated\n24. 50 kilometers\n25. temperature\n26.

It looks a bit like a\ncigar\n答案解析：这道题比较简单，虽然没有明确的提示词告诉大家答案即将到来，但空前词like原词出现，很容易锁定cigar。\n第22题答案：13 (different) countries\n对应原文：Over the last five years scientists from\nthirteen countries\nhave been taking part in the project and launching floats in their area of ocean control.\n答案解析：句子结构基本没变，听到scientists from就知道后面跟的肯定是答案。不过不少同学做听力的时候因为比较慌张，很容易漏写后面的countries。\n第23题答案：activated\n对应原文：Each of the floats is dropped in the ocean from a boat at a set point and\nactivated\nfrom a satellite.\n答案解析：听到ocean意识到答案即将到来，从题干语法结构可以推测空上填的应该是能够与dropped并列的动词，再加上and原词出现，由此锁定activated。\n第24题答案：50 km(s)\n对应原文：During this time it’s possible for it to cover quite large distances but the average is\nfifty kilometers\n.\n答案解析：从题干中所问的avarage distance可以推测空上应该填的是距离。虽然前面录音中也提到了2000 meter，但那说的是垂直距离，而非水平移动的距离，因此排除，确定50 kms为答案。\n第25题答案：temperature\n对应原文：but as it rises to the surface it collects all sorts of data, most importantly variations in salinity, that’s salt levels, and the changes in\ntemperature\n答案解析：听到salinity意识到答案即将到来，与其并列的词组为changes in temperature。因为change在题干上已经出现，由此确定答案为temperature。\n第26题答案：A\n对应原文：Some of the data has already helped in completing projects. For example, our understanding of the underlying causes of El Niño\n答案解析：这道题出的有些狡诈，主要依靠already一词来判断这件事情已经发生，由此确定答案A为答案。不过already读的很弱，非常不容易识别出来。\n第27题答案：C\n对应原文：understand the mechanics of climate change, like global warming and ozone depletion. That’s part of an ongoing variability study but the results are still a long way off\n答案解析：long way off表示遥远的未来，与C选项对应，由此确定答案为C。\n第28题答案：A\n对应原文：we can advise the navy on search and rescue missions. That’s happening right now\n答案解析：这道题比较简单一些，录音中直接提到了right now，而且读的很重，很容易判断A为答案。\n第29题答案：B\n对应原文：we hope it will help to bring about more sustainable fishing practices. We’ll be seeing the results of that quite soon\n答案解析：quite soon表示很快就能够实现，对应B选项的in the near future.\n第21题答案：C\n对应原文：I agree that this concept is still a long way in the future\n答案解析：与C选项的区别只在于一个是term，一个是way，很容易判断答案。整个这道匹配题的关键在于，能够实现通过选项判断出来自己要去听时间，有了明确的目标点之后，剩下的就很简单了。"

Today’s lecture forms part of the Hospitality and Tourism module. Last week I looked at the economy end of the hotel business; this week I’m going to discuss the luxury end of the market. Let’s consider the following scenario…\nYou wake up in the middle of the night in a strange hotel miles away from home, disoriented most probably from jet lag, when even the most expensive surroundings\ncan seem empty and dispiriting\n. You have paid a great deal of money to stay in this first-class hotel with its contemporary technology, but according to recent research carried out by an international travel and public relations company, all is not well. The research suggests that even the most opulent, luxurious hotels seem to have underestimated the most basic needs of their customers – be they travelling for work or pleasure:\nthe need to feel at home in surroundings which are both familiar and inviting\n.\nQ31 Q32\nDo these findings, however, apply only to hotels situated in particular areas? Is it possible that the external environment can affect a guest’s well-being? The company’s research covered a\nwhole range of different hotel types\n, both independent hotels and those which are part of large chains. They investigated chic so-called boutique hotels in the heart of downtown business districts, stately mansions located in the depths of beautiful countryside, and plush hotels built at the edge of tropical beaches surrounded by palm trees and idyllic blue ocean. . And the research concluded that\nwhat was outside the hotel building simply didn’t matter\n. This is a fascinating revelation and those of you hoping to move into careers in the travel and leisure industry would be well advised to look at the findings in more detail.\nQ33 Q34\nBut back to the main point of this lecture… the need to feel at home. What can the hotel industry do about it? And is the very idea so subjective that it’s impossible to do anything about it on a global basis?\nHowever, nothing stands still in this world. One company has come up with the slogan ‘Take Your Home With You’, and aims to provide clients with luxury serviced apartments. Those in the business travel industry maintain that these serviced apartments dispense with all the unwanted and expensive hotel services\nthat business travellers don’t want\n,\nwhile maximising the facilities they do want. For example, not only sleeping and living accommodation, but also\na sleek modern kitchen\nthat allows guests to cook and entertain if they wish, at no additional cost. The attractions of such facilities are obvious and it’ll be interesting to see whether the company manages\nto establish a trend all over the world\nand make a lasting impact on the luxury accommodation market.\nQ35 Q36 Q37\nNow, finally I want to consider the psychology underpinning the traditional holiday hotel industry. As a hotelier, how do you go about attracting people to give up the security of their own home and entrust themselves to staying in a completely strange place and sleeping in an unfamiliar bed? Firstly, hotels exploit people’s\nneed to escape\nthe predictability of their everyday lives. For a few days people can pretend they are free of responsibilities and can indulge themselves. Secondly, there is something very powerful in our need to be pampered and looked after,\nit’s almost as if we return to being a baby\n, when everything was done for us and we felt safe and secure. And not far removed from this is the pleasure in being spoilt and given little treats – like the miniscule bottles of shampoo and tiny bars of soap,\nthe chocolate\non your pillow at night – and we actually forget that we are paying for it all!\nQ38 Q39 Q40\nNext week, I’m going to look at eco-hotels, a fairly new phenomenon but increasingly popular…\n剑7 test 3 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31.

Those in the\nbusiness\ntravel industry …  that\nbusiness\ntravellers don’t want\n答案解析：这道题从两个地方都可以确定答案。前面说该酒店的主要对象是商业旅行行业，后面又再次明确提到business travellers（空后词原词出现），由此确定business为答案。\n第36题答案：kitchen\n对应原文： For example, not only sleeping and living accommodation, but also a sleek modern\nkitchen\nthat allows guests to cook and entertain if they wish, at no additional cost.\n答案解析：虽然stylish与modern的同义替换能够起到一定的提示作用，但不少同学并不知道stylish的确切含义。因此这道题我们可以换个思路。听到for example意识到上一点已经结束，这道题即将开始，然后根据词性以及顾客可以使用这两个条件对听到的单词进行筛选，最终发现只有kitchen填上去比较合适。\n第37题答案：world\n对应原文：it’ll be interesting to see whether the company manages to establish a trend all over the\nworld\n答案解析：相比于前两道题目而言，这道题要稍微简单一些。题干中的trend原词出现，有很强的提示作用，而throughout与all over的替换也不算太过复杂。\n第38题答案：escape\n对应原文：Firstly, hotels exploit people’s need to\nescape\nthe predictability of their everyday lives.\n答案解析：听到firstly意识到答案即将出现。从题干可以推测空上应该填一个动词，这这句话中唯一的动词就是escape，由此确定答案。\n第39题答案：baby\n对应原文：Secondly, there is something very powerful in our need to be pampered and looked after, it’s almost as if we return to being a\nbaby\n答案解析：听到secondly意识到答案即将出现，随后将注意力放在空前词like上，发现as if与like同义替换，而随后的名词为baby，由此确定答案。\n第40题答案：chocolate\n对应原文：And not far removed from this is the pleasure in being spoilt and given little treats – like the miniscule bottles of shampoo and tiny bars of soap,\nthe chocolate\non your pillow\n答案解析：这道题难度稍大，虽然看起来是考察并列关系，但题干用cosmetics对shampoo和soap进行了概括，很容易让我们措手不及。不过chocolate读的很重，算是留了条活路。"

So let’s get under way on our tour around this wonderful park.\nQ11\nI’ll start today with some general background information. There\nused to be a lot of factories\nin this area until the 1960s. Creating the park required the demolition of lots of derelict buildings on the site, so most of the exciting park space all around you was originally\nwarehouses and storehouses\n.\nQ12\nThe idea of building a public park here was first discussed when a property developer proposed a high-rise housing development, but the local community wasn’t happy. If the land was to be cleaned up,\nthey wanted to use the site for recreation. Residents wanted open space for outdoor activities, rather than housing or even an indoor sports complex\n.\nQ13\nNow to the Bicentennial Park itself. It has two areas, a nature reserve and a formal park with man-made features and gardens. The tall blue-and-white building in front of us is called The Tower and\nis the centre point for the formal gardens\n. It stands twelve metres high, so follow me up the stairs to where we can take advantage of the fantastic views.\nQ14\nWell, here we are at the top of The Tower, and we’re going to look at the view from each direction. Out to the east, the large buildings about a kilometre away are on the Olympic site. There’s an indoor arena for gymnastics, a stadium for track and field and a swimming pool for races and synchronised swimming and also diving. If you look carefully down there, you can see the train lines. The Olympic site has its own station to encourage the use of public transport.\nThere is also a\ncar park\n, but it only holds a limited number of cars.\nQ15\nThe formal park has some specially-created water features. If you look out here to the south, you can see a circular ornamental pond.\nAnd around to the west, you can relax and sit on a bench to smell the flowers in the\nrose garden\n, and finally up to the north, if you look in front of you now, there’s a lake with a small island in the centre, you can hire rowing boats at the boat shed, which you can’t see from here, but if you look through the trees, you can see the\ncafé\n, which has lovely views across the water. OK, let’s climb down now. We will go now and have a look at the nature reserve section of the park, which has opened up natural wetland to the public.\nQ16 Q17\nThe Mangroves have been made more accessible to visitors by the boardwalk built during the park’s upgrade. You’d think that people would come here to look at the unusual plant life of the area, but in fact it’s more often used for\ncycling\nand is very popular with the local clubs. This is the far end of the park and over there you can see the Frog Pond, a natural feature here long before the park was designed. Just next to it we have our outdoor classroom, a favourite spot for school parties. The area is now most often used by primary schools for\nbiology lessons\n.\nQ18 Q19\nAnd finally let’s pass by the Waterbird Refuge. This area is in a sheltered part of the estuary, that’s why the park’s\nviewing shelter\nis a favourite spot for bird watchers who can use it to spy through binoculars. You can watch a variety of water birds, but most visitors expect to see black swans when they come to the shelter. You might spot one yourself right now!\nQ20\nWell, here we are back at our starting point, the Visitor Centre.\n剑7 test 4 Section 2雅思听力答案\n11. C\n12. B\n13. A\n14.

Residents wanted open space for outdoor activities, rather than housing or even an indoor sports complex.\n答案解析：录音中提到，当地居民想将这块地用于娱乐，而非室内运动场馆。A选项leisure与原文中recreation同义替换，由此确定答案。B选项是开发商想做的事情，而C选项则在录音中被明确否定。\n第14题答案：B\n对应原文： The tall blue-and-white building in front of us is called The Tower and\nis the centre point for the formal gardens\n答案解析：这道题比较简单，无论是题干还是选项都基本原词出现，而且还没有设置干扰项，属于送分题。\n第15题答案：car park\n对应原文： The Olympic site has its own station to encourage the use of public transport. There is also a\ncar park\n, but it only holds a limited number of cars\n答案解析：这道题没有明显的方位词，需要大家根据录音中从上到下的描述顺序，或者station这一已知建筑来判断到了这一点。因为题目要求不超过两个词，所以停车场写成carpark或者car park都可以。\n第16题答案：rose garden\n对应原文：And around to the west, you can relax and sit on a bench to smell the flowers in the\nrose garden\n答案解析：根据方位词west和已知地点bench比较好确定答案即将出现。但rose garden因为离提示词太近，所以有些容易反应不过来。\n第17题答案：cafe\n对应原文：but if you look through the trees, you can see the\ncafé\n答案解析：17题位于树中间，听到trees意识到答案即将出现。cafe属于雅思听力地图题中的超级常考词，e上的撇可加可不加。\n第18题答案：cycling\n对应原文：You’d think that people would come here to look at the unusual plant life of the area, but in fact it’s more often used for\ncycling\n答案解析：根据表头推测空上应该填一种活动，but这一转折词更加提示大家答案即将到来，比较容易锁定cycling。\n第19题答案：biology lesson\n对应原文： Just next to it we have our outdoor classroom, a favourite spot for school parties. The area is now most often used by primary schools for\nbiology lessons\n.\n答案解析：一些同学可能会误填成outdoor classroom，单从原文看它并没有什么问题。但这一短语并不符合表头activity的要求，因此要继续往下听，最终锁定biology lessons。\n第20题答案：viewing shelter\n对应原文：This area is in a sheltered part of the estuary, that’s why the park’s\nviewing shelter\nis a favourite spot for bird watchers\n答案解析：这道题的难点有两个。其一，没有明确的提示词告诉大家答案即将到来；其二，viewing shelter这个短语对不少同学来说都比较陌生，哪怕听到了也反应不过来。"

Now, MSG as you probably know, is a flavour enhancer which is used particularly in Chinese and Japanese cooking. Today I am going to explore why it is so popular in these cuisines and, more importantly,\nhow does it enhance the flavour of food\n?\nQ31\nThe main reason why MSG is more commonly used in Japanese meals is tradition. For many thousands of years the Japanese have incorporated a type of seaweed known as kombu in their cooking, as they discovered it had the ability to make food taste better. But it wasn’t until 1908 that the ingredient in kombu which was responsible for the improvement in flavour was\nactually discovered to be glutamate\nby scientists working there.\nQ32\nFrom 1908 until 1956, glutamate was produced commercially in Japan by a very slow and expensive means of extraction. It was in 1956 that the speed of the process was improved, and\nindustrial production increased dramatically\nand still continues to increase to this day.\nQ33\nIn fact, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of MSG are produced all over the world today.\nSo what exactly is MSG? Well, Monosodium Glutamate contains seventy-eight point two per cent glutamate, twelve point two per cent sodium and\nnine point six per cent water\n.\nQ34\nGlutamate is an amino acid that can be found naturally in all protein-containing foods, erm, so this includes food such as\nmeat and cheese\n.\nQ35 Q36\nIt is widely known that Chinese and Japanese food contains MSG but many people don’t seem to be aware that it is also used in foods in other parts of the world. For example it is found in commercially made Italian pizzas, in American fast food and in Britain MSG is used in things like potato crisps.\nSo, how exactly does MSG work? Well, in the Western world, we commonly talk of four ‘tastes’, and I’m sure you’re all familiar with the concepts of sweet, sour, bitter and salt. Well, in 1908, Kikunae Ikeda\nidentified a fifth ‘taste’\n. And it is thought that MSG intensifies this naturally occurring ‘taste’ in some food. It does make perfect evolutionary sense that we should have the ability to detect or taste glutamate because\nit is the amino acid which is most common in natural foods\n.\nQ37 Q38\nJohn Prescott, an associate professor at the University of Chicago, suggests that this fifth taste serves a purpose just as the other tastes do. He suggests that it signals to us the presence of protein in food, in the same way that sweetness indicates that a food contains energy-giving carbohydrates.\nBitterness\n, he says, alerts us of toxins in the food, while sourness warns us of spoilage and\nsaltiness signals the presence of minerals\n.\nQ39 Q40\nSo, what else do we know about this fifth taste…\n剑7 test 4 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31.

They had\na video\nwith all the highlights of the festival at a stand in the lobby to the library\n答案解析：B选项完全没有提到直接排除。录音中说的是，男生看到一段视频，视频里有人在演奏音乐，而非直接看到有人在演奏音乐，因此排除A，选择C。\n第2题答案：B\n对应原文：Yeah, though I think that if you sit at the back you can actually hear the whole thing better\n答案解析：录音中确实提到了看的更清楚，但这是坐在前面的好处，不符合题干，由此排除。C选项文章来自老烤鸭雅思完全没有提到。B选项只是把better替换成了clearly，把握好题干要求还是很容易选出来的。\n第3题答案：48 North Avenue\n对应原文：I’ll do it. Name George O’Neill. Address:\n48 North Avenue,\nWestse\na\n答案解析：大多数情况下，雅思听力Section 1都只要求大家填写地址的一部分，而不像这道题这样要求写出完整的内容。因为它涉及三个信息点，所以不少同学容易写完前面的忘了后面的。\n第4题答案：WS6 2YH\n对应原文：Just a minute – I’ve got it written down here.\nWS6 2YH\n.\n答案解析：基本属于送分题，但因为离上一道题的地址距离较近，很容易一不小心错过。\n第5题答案：01674 553242\n对应原文：\n01674 553242\n. SO, let’s book two tickets for Guitarrini\n答案解析：考察数字这一知识点。一般来说，Section 1考察的数字都在8-12位之间。但也曾出现过连考16位的情况，需要大家提升对数字的敏感度。\n第6题答案：(free) drink(s)/refreshment(s)\n对应原文： Free refreshments! … Yes, look here. Sunday 17th of June. Singer, ticket ￡6. 00 includes\ndrinks\nin the garden.\n答案解析：这道题难度不大。大家既可以根据include与free的对应，确定refreshments为答案。也可以根据includes这一原词锁定drinks。\n第7题答案：(the/a) pianist/piano player\n对应原文：I’m feeling quite keen now! How about the\npianist\non the 22nd of June?\n答案解析：pianist虽然属于初中时就会学到的词汇，但在日常生活中用的较少。再加上这道题完全没有提示词，直接说出答案，很容易反应不过来。属于该Section 1中最难的一道题。\n第8题答案：10.50\n对应原文： I’m sure Tom and Kieran would enjoy that too. Good heavens\n￡10.50\na ticket!\n答案解析：考察金钱的说法，以及50和15的区分。因为女性读的比较明显，难度不算很大。\n第9题答案：4\n对应原文： we’ll need to book\nfour\n答案解析：题目本身没有什么难度，但因为离10.50太近。容易因为思考上一道题而漏过它。\n第10题答案：50%\n对应原文：Children, Students and Senior Citizens get a\n50%\ndiscount on everything.\n答案解析：百分比这一知识点在雅思听力Section 1中考察的频率很高。大家既可以写50%，也可以写50 percent，还可以写50 per cent。三者都对。不过在采用最后一种写法的时候要注意题干上的字数要求。"

In regard to opening hours, we’re open every day of the week from 9. 00 am to 8. 00 pm except on Mondays when we close at\n1.30 pm (Q11)\n. And, in fact the only day in the year when we’re closed is on the\n25th of\nDecember (Q12\n)\n. You can book a guided tour for your school group any time that we’re open.\nIf you bring a school group to the museum, when you arrive we ask you to remain with your group in the\ncar park (Q13)\n. One or more of the tour guides will welcome you there and brief you about what the tour will be about. We do this there because our entrance is quite small and we really haven’t got much room for briefing groups in the exhibition area.\nAs far as the amount of time you’ll need goes, if you bring a school group you should plan on allowing a minimum of 90 minutes for the visit. This allows 15 minutes to get on and off the coach,\n45 minutes (Q14)\nfor the guided tour and 30 minutes for after-tour activities.\nIf you’re going to have lunch at the museum you will, of course, have to allow more time. There are two cafés in the museum, with seating for 80 people. If you want to eat there you’ll need to reserve some seating, as they can get quite crowded at lunch time. Then outside the museum at the back there are\ntables (Q15)\n, and students can bring their own lunch and eat it there in the open air.\nWhen the students come into the museum foyer we ask them to check in their backpacks with their books, lunch boxes, etc, at the cloakroom before they enter the museum proper. I’m afraid in the past we have had a few things gone missing after school visits so this is a strict rule. Also, some of the exhibits are fragile and we don’t want them to be accidentally knocked. But\nwe do provide school students with handouts with questions and quizzes on them\n.\n(\nQ16\n)\nThere’s so much that students can learn in the museum and it’s fun for them to have something to do. Of course,\nthey’ll need to bring something to write with for these\n(\nQ17\n)\n. We do allow students to take photographs\n(\nQ18\n)\n.\nFor students who are doing projects it’s useful to make some kind of visual record of what they see that they can add to their reports. And finally, they should not bring anything to eat into the museum, or drinks of any kind.\nThere are also a few things the students can do after the tour. In the theatrette on the ground floor there are\nc\nontinuous screenings of short documentaries about dinosaurs which they can see (Q19)\nat any time. We used to have an activity room with more interactive things like making models of dinosaurs and drawing and painting pictures, even hunting for dinosaur eggs, but unfortunately the room was damaged in a bad storm recently when water came in the roof, so that’s closed at the moment. But we do have an IT centre where students have access to CD ROMs\nwith a ranqe of dinosaur games (Q20)\n. These games are a lot of fun, but they also teach the students about the lives of dinosaurs, how they found food, protected their habitat, survived threats, that kind of thing.\nAnd. . . I think that’s all I have to tell you. Please feel free to ask any questions if you would like to know anything else. . .\n剑8 test 1 Section 2雅思听力答案\n11. 1.30\n12. 25 December\n13. car park/parking lot\n14. 45\n15. (some) tables\n16-18.

You wanted to see me to get some feedback on your group’s proposal. The one you’re submitting for the Geography Society field trip competition. I’ve had a look through your proposal and I think it’s a really good choice. In fact, I only have a few things to say about it, but even in an outline document like this you really have to be careful to avoid typos and problems with layout in the proposal, and even in the contents page. So read it through carefully before submitting it, okay?\nSANDRA: Will do.\nTUTOR: And I’ve made a few notes on the proposal about things which\ncould have been better sequenced\n(\nQ21\n)\n.\nSANDRA: Okay.\nTUTOR: AS for the writing itself, I’ve annotated the proposal as and where I thought it could be improved. Generally speaking, I feel you’ve often used complex structures and long sentences for the sake of it and as a consequence. . . although your paragraphing and inclusion of subheadings help. . . it’s quite hard to follow your train of thought at times.\nSo cut them down a bit, can you?\n(\nQ22\n)\nSANDRA: Really?\nTUTOR: Yes. And don’t forget simple formatting like numbering.\nSANDRA: Didn’t I use page numbers?\nTUTOR: I didn’t mean that. Look, you’ve remembered to include headers and footers, which is good, but\nlisting ideas clearly is important\n(\nQ23\n)\n. Number them or use bullet points, which is even clearer. Then you’ll focus the reader on your main points. I thought your suggestion to go to the Navajo Tribal Park was a very good idea.\nSANDRA: I’ve always wanted to go there.\nMy father was a great fan of cowboy films and the Wild West so I was subjected to seeing all the epics, many of which were shot there\n(\nQ24\n)\n. As a consequence, it feels very familiar to me and it’s awesome both geographically and visually, so it’s somewhere I’ve always wanted to visit. The subsequent research I did and the online photographs made me even keener.\nTUTOR: Interesting. Right, let’s look at the content of your proposal now.\nSANDRA: Did you find it comprehensive enough?\nTUTOR: Well, yes and no. You’ve listed several different topics on your contents page, but I’m not sure they’re all relevant.\nSANDRA: NO? Well, I thought that from the perspective of a field trip, one thing I needed\nto focus on was the sandstone plateaux and cliffs themselves\n. (\nQ25\n) The way they tower up from the flat landscape is just amazing. The fact that the surrounding softer rocks were eroded by wind and rain, leaving these huge outcrops high above the plain. It’s hardly surprising that tourists flock to see the area.\nTUTOR: Well, yes, I’d agree with including those points. . .\nSANDRA: And then the fact that it’s been home to native American Navajos and all the social history that goes with that. The hardships they endured trying to save their territory from the invading settlers. Their culture is so rich – all those wonderful stories.\nTUTOR: Well, I agree it’s interesting, but it’s not immediately relevant to your proposal, Sandra, so at this stage, I suggest you focus on other considerations.\nI think an indication of what the students on the trip could actually do when they get there should be far more central\n(\nQ26\n), so that certainly needs to be included and to be expanded upon.\nAnd I’d like to see something about the local wildlife, and vegetation too\n(\nQ27\n), not that I imagine there’s much to see. Presumably the tourist invasion hasn’t helped.\nSANDRA: Okay, I’ll do some work on those two areas as well. But you’re right, there’s not much apart from some very shallow-rooted species. Although it’s cold and snowy there in the winter, the earth is baked so hard in the summer sun that rainwater can’t penetrate. So it’s a case of flood or drought, really.\nTUTOR: So, I understand. Now, before we look at everything in more detail, I’ve got a few factual questions for you. It would be a good idea to include the answers in your finished proposal, because they’re missing from your draft.\nSANDRA: Fine.\nTUTOR: So, you mentioned the monoliths and the spires, which was good, but what area does the tribal park cover? Do you know?\nSANDRA:\n12, 000\n(\nQ28\n) hectares, and the plain is at about 5, 850 metres above sea level.\nTUTOR: Larger than I expected. Okay. Where’s the nearest accommodation? That’s a practical detail that you haven’t included. Have you done any research on that?\nSANDRA: Yes. There’s nowhere to stay in the park itself, but there’s an old trading post called Goulding quite near. All kinds of tours start from Goulding, too.\nTUTOR: What kind of tours?\nSANDRA: Well, the most popular are in four-wheel drive jeeps – but I wouldn’t recommend hiring those. I think the best way to appreciate the area would be to hire\nhorses\n(\nQ29\n) instead and trek around on those. Biking is not allowed and it’s impossible to drive around the area in private vehicles. The tracks are too rough.\nTUTOR: Okay, lastly, what else is worth visiting there?\nSANDRA: There are several\ncaves\n(\nQ30\n), but I haven’t looked into any details. I’ll find out about them.\nTUTOR: Okay, good. Now what I’d like to know is. . .\n剑8 test 1 Section 3雅思听力答案\n21. A\n22. C\n23. A\n24. B\n25-27. BCF\n28. 12000\n29. horses\n30. caves"

Look, you’ve remembered to include headers and footers, which is good, but\nlisting ideas clearly is important\n答案解析：女生在录音中提到了C选项中的page numbers，但被老师否定，说并不是这个意思，由此排除C。B选项没有提到。A选项采用反义替换，录音中说的是各个观点的分列需要更清晰一些，选项则变成各个观点不够清晰，由此确定答案。\n第24题答案：B\n对应原文： I’ve always wanted to go there.\nMy father was a great fan of cowboy films and the Wild West so I was subjected to seeing all the epics, many of which were shot there\n答案解析：题干中问的是她怎样对Navajo National Park产生了兴趣。A和C虽然也有提到，但是是后来的事情，只是加深了她已有的兴趣，由此排除，确定B为答案。\n第25题答案：B\n对应原文：\nI think an indication of what the students on the trip could actually do when they get there should be far more central\n答案解析：老师建议，学生在旅行中能够做的事情才是最重要的，对应B选项的field trip activities.\n第26题答案：C\n对应原文： one thing I needed\nto focus on was the sandstone plateaux and cliffs themselves\n.\n答案解析：这道题采用概括替换的手法，将录音中sandstone（砂岩）, plateaux（高原）和cliffs（悬崖）概括为geographical features，由此确定答案。\n第27题答案：F\n对应原文：\nAnd I’d like to see something about the local wildlife, and vegetation too\n答案解析：plant与vegetation同义替换，animal与wildlife同义替换。这两组对应词汇在雅思听力中经常出现，大家务必要记在心里。\n第28题答案：12000\n对应原文：\n12, 000\nhectares, and the plain is at about 5, 850 metres above sea level.\n答案解析：从题干可以推测空上应该填一个数字，hectares原词出现，提示12000为答案。\n第29题答案：horses\n对应原文：but I wouldn’t recommend hiring those. I think the best way to appreciate the area would be to hire\nhorses\n答案解析：从题干可以推测空上填的是一种交通方式，不过录音中女性接连否定了jeeps, trek, biking等，只有horese比较合适。\n第30题答案：caves\n对应原文：There are several\ncaves\n答案解析：这道题的难点在于没有什么提示词，只能通过题干事先判断空上填的应该是某个地点或者景点。然后通过问答节奏和重读来确定答案。"

We’ll begin with some basics. Firstly, what do we learn by studying geography?\nWell, we learn a great deal about all the processes that have affected and that continue to affect the earth’s\nsurface\n(\nQ31\n). But we learn far more than that, because studying geography also informs us about the different kinds of relationships that develop between a particular\nenvironment\n(\nQ32\n) and the people that live there.\nOkay. We like to think of geography as having two main branches. There’s the study of the nature of our planet – its physical features, what it actually looks like – and then there’s the study of the ways in which we choose to live and of the\nimpact\n(\nQ33\n) of those on our planet. Our current use of carbon fuels is a good example of that.\nBut there are more specific study areas to consider too, and we’ll be looking at each of these in turn throughout this semester. These include bio-physical geography, by which I mean the study of the natural environment and all its living things. Then there’s topography – that looks at the shapes of the land and oceans. There’s the study of political geography and social geography too, of course, which is the study of communities of people. We have economic geography – in which we examine all kinds of resources and their use in agriculture, for example. Next comes historical geography – the understanding of how people and their environments and the ways they interact have changed over a period of time – and\nurban\n(\nQ34\n) geography, an aspect I’m particularly interested in, which takes as its focus the location of cities, the services that those cities provide, and migration of people to and from such cities. And lastly, we have cartography. That’s the art and science of mapmaking. You’ll be doing a lot of that!\nSo, to summarise before we continue, we now have our key answer. . . studying this subject is important because without geographical knowledge, we would know very little about our surroundings and we wouldn’t be able to identify all the\nproblems\n(\nQ35\n) that relate to them. So, by definition, we wouldn’t be in an informed position to work out how to solve any of them.\nOkay, now for some practicalities. What do geographers actually do? Well, we collect data to begin with! You’ll be doing a lot of that on your first field trip! How do we do this? There are several means. We might, for example, conduct a census – count a population in a given area perhaps. We also need\nimages\n(\nQ36\n) of the earth’s surface which we can produce by means of computer-generation technology or with the help of satellite relays. We’ve come a very long way from the early exploration of the world by sailing ships when geographers only had pens and paper at their disposal.\nAfter we’ve gathered our information, we must analyze it! We need to look for\npatterns\n(\nQ37\n), most commonly those of causes and consequences. This kind of information helps us to predict and resolve problems that could affect the world we live in.\nBut we don’t keep all this information confidential. We then need to publish our findings so that other people can access it and be informed by it. And one way in which this information can be published is in the form of maps. You’ll all have used one at some stage of your life already. Let’s consider the benefits of maps from a geographer’s perspective.\nMaps can be folded and put in a pocket and can provide a great store of reference when they’re collected into an atlas. They can depict the physical features of the entire planet if necessary, or, just a small part of it in much greater detail. But there is a drawback. You can’t exactly replicate something that is three-dimensional, like our planet, on a flat piece of paper, because paper has only two dimensions, and that means there’ll always be a certain degree of\ndistortion\n(\nQ38\n) on a map. It can’t be avoided.\nWe can also use aerial photographs. . , pictures taken by cameras at high altitude above the earth. These are great for showing all kinds of geographical features that are not easy to see from the ground. You can easily illustrate areas of diseased trees or how much\ntraffic\n(\nQ39\n)is on the roads at a given time or information about deep sea beds, for example.\nThen there are Landsats. These are satellites that circle the earth and transmit visual information to computers at receiving stations. They circle the earth several times a day and can provide a mass of information – you’ll all be familiar with the information they give us about the\nweather\n(\nQ40\n), for example.\nSo, what we’re going to do now is look at a short presentation in which you’ll see all these tools. . .\n剑8 test 1 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31. surface\n32. environment\n33. impact(s)/effect(s)\n34. urban\n35. problems\n36. images\n37. patterns\n38. distortion(s)\n39. traffic\n40. weather"

We need to look for\npatterns\n答案解析：听到analyze意识到答案即将到来。identify与look for同义替换，由此确定答案为patterns。\n第38题答案：distortion(s)\n对应原文：because paper has only two dimensions, and that means there’ll always be a certain degree of\ndistortion\n答案解析：锁定答案并不难，毕竟two dimensions的定位作用明显，而distortion读的也很重。难点主要在于单词拼写。\n第39题答案：traffic\n对应原文：You can easily illustrate areas of diseased trees or how much\ntraffic\nis on the roads at a given time or information about deep sea beds, for example\n答案解析：雅思听力中考察并列关系很常见的一个手法，将第一个并列项vegetation problems同义替换，寄希望于大家没有反应过来。这种情况下，去听语调的起伏，或者并列关系词会更容易一些。\n第40题答案：weather\n对应原文：you’ll all be familiar with the information they give us about the\nweather\n, for example.\n答案解析：听到上一行的receiving stations意识到答案即将到来。虽然monitoring和information的对应不太好识别，但weather读的比较重，而且填上去也符合题干意思。"

Can you give me your name please?\nMICHAEL:       Yes. It’s\nMichael Alexander\n(\nExample\n).\nJUDY:         Okay. And your address please?\nMICHAEL:       My old address or my current one?\nJUDY:          Your current one.\nMICHAEL:       It’s 24 Manly Street, Milperra near Sydney.\nJUDY:         What was the suburb, sorry?\nMICHAEL:      Milperra.\nM-I-L-P-E-R-R-A\n.

Now, the dates. Do you know when the ship arrived?\nMICHAEL:       It left on the 11th of October and got to Sydney on the\n28th of November\n(\nQ3\n).\nJUDY:         Okay. I need one more thing. There’s a reference number. It should be in the top right-hand corner of the pink form they gave you.\nMICHAEL:       Let me have a look. I have so many papers. Yes, here it is. It’s 601 ACK.\nJUDY:         Thanks.\nJUDY:         I need to take down a few details of the actual damage over the phone before you put in a full report. Can you tell me how many items were damaged and what the damage was?\nMICHAEL:      Yes, well four things actually. I’ll start with the big things. My TV first of all. It’s a large one. . . very expensive.\nJUDY:         Our insurance doesn’t cover electrical problems.\nMICHAEL:       It isn’t an electrical problem.\nThe\nscreen\nhas a huge crack\n(\nQ4\n) in it so it’s unusable.\nJUDY:         I see. Any idea of the price to repair it?\nMICHAEL:       NO. Well, I don’t think it can be repaired. It will need a new one.\nJUDY:         Okay. I’ll make a note of that and we’ll see what we can do. Now, what was the second item?\nMICHAEL:       The cabinet from the\nbathroom\n(\nQ5\n) was damaged as well. It’s a lovely cabinet, we use it to keep our towels in.\nJUDY:         And what is the extent of the damage?\nMICHAEL:       Well, the back and the sides seem okay but the\ndoor\nhas a huge hole in it. (\nQ6\n)It can’t be repaired. I’m really not very happy about it.\nJUDY:         And how much do you think it will cost to replace it?\nMICHAEL:      Well, when I bought it last year I paid $125 for it. But the one I’ve seen here in Sydney is a bit more expensive, it’s\n$140\n. (\nQ7\n)\nJUDY:         Right, and what was the third item?\nMICHAEL:      My dining room table. It’s a lovely table from Indonesia. It must have been very hot inside the container because one\nleg\nhas completely split (\nQ8\n) down the middle. The top and the other three look okay thank goodness.\nJUDY:         Any idea of the price to repair it?\nMICHAEL:      Well, I had an estimate done on this actually because it is a very special table to us. They quoted us $200, which is really pricey so I hope the insurance will cover the total cost.\nJUDY:         I’m sure that will be fine. What was the last item, Mr Alexander?\nMICHAEL:      Well, we have a lovely set of china plates and dishes, you know, with matching cups, saucers, the lot. They were all in the one box which must have got dropped because some\nplates\n(\nQ9\n) were broken – six actually.\nJUDY:         And can you tell me the replacement value of these?\nMICHAEL:      Well, it’s hard to say because they were part of a set but they can be up to $10 each as it’s such a good set.\nJUDY:         Okay, so that would be around\n$60\n(\nQ10\n) altogether?\nMICHAEL:      Yes, that’s right.\nJUDY:         And is that all of the items?\nMICHAEL:      Yes.

As you know, we have only been open a week so you are amongst our first visitors. We have lots of fascinating indoor and outdoor exhibits on our huge complex, spreading hundreds of hectares. Our remit is\nto give educational opportunities to the wider public as well as to offer research sites for a wide variety of agriculturists and other scientists\n. (\nQ11\n)\nLet’s start by seeing what there is to do. As you can see here on our giant wall plan, we are now situated in the Reception block. . . here. As you walk out of the main door into the park there is a path you can follow. If you follow this route you will immediately come into the Rare Breeds section, where we keep a wide variety of animals which I shall be telling you a little more about later. Next to this. . . moving east. . . is the large grazing area for the rare breeds. Then further east. . . in the largest section of our Park is the\nForest\n(\nQ12\n)\nArea. South of the grazing area and in fact just next to the Reception block is our Experimental Crop Area. In the middle of the Park. . . this circular area is our lake  These two small rectangular shapes here, are the\nFish Farms\n(\nQ13\n)where we rear fish for sale. To the east of those is the marsh area which attracts a great many migrant birds. In the south-eastern corner, beyond the marsh, is our\nMarket Garden\n(\nQ14\n) area, growing vegetables and flowers.\nAll these areas can be visited by the general public for almost all the year. . . although. . . please take note of the large signs at the entrance to each area which tell. . . which tell you when certain areas are being used for particular controlled experiments and are therefore\ntemporarily out of bounds\n(\nQ15\n) to the public.\nYou can see for yourself what a huge area the park covers and a key question is always, how can we move around? Well you have a choice of means. . . all environmentally friendly. . . cars are banned in the park. We have\nbicycles\nwhich you can hire behind the Reception block. . . here. . . the healthy ones of you can\ngo on foot and finally there’s our electric tram, powered from solar cells\n(\nQ16\n). You find more information about this at the front entrance.\nA good place to start on your tour is the Rare Breeds section.\nWe keep goats, sheep and hens and other kinds of poultry\n(\nQ17\n). We are also thinking of bringing in cows and horses but we do not, as yet, have facilities for these bigger animals. The animals are fed in public twice a day and a short lecture given on their feeding habits and nutritional needs. These are very popular with the public but of course we mustn’t lose sight of the main purpose of having this section, not as such to preserve rare animals but\nto maintain the diversity of breeds\n(\nQ18\n) to broaden the gene pool for agricultural development. Green Vale changes with the seasons with different events happening at different times of the year. May will be perhaps our most spectacular month with the arrival of the Canada geese and when our fruit trees will be in full blossom, but there are interesting events on all year round, for example, John Havers,\nour expert fly fisherman, is currently giving displays\n(\nQ19\n)on the lake. Each of the sections has its own seasonal calendar. . . please consult the summary board at the main entrance. And the final section, as we return to the Reception blocks, is the orchard.\nDo take time to browse around our shop. . . there is a wide selection of\nbooks on wildlife\n(\nQ20\n), some of them written by local authors, and the history of farming, including organic farming, something which the park will be diversifying into in the coming months.\n剑8 test 2 Section 2雅思听力答案\n11.

Then further east. . . in the largest section of our Park is the\nForest\nArea.\n答案解析：根据已知地点grazing area，方位词further east，以及形容词largest定位到地图的右上角。进而确定forest是答案。\n第13题答案：Fish Farms\n对应原文：In the middle of the Park. . . this circular area is our lake  These two small rectangular shapes here, are the\nFish Farms\nwhere we rear fish for sale.\n答案解析：这道题容易出现错误的地方有两个。一是文章来自老烤鸭雅思部分同学因为紧张或不认识rectangular将它作为答案写了出来。二是fish farms的farm出现浊化，一些同学可能会联想成pond。\n第14题答案：Market Garden\n对应原文：In the south-eastern corner, beyond the marsh, is our\nMarket Garden\narea\n答案解析：根据方位词south-eastern corner定位到地图的右下角，进而确定market garden为答案。这里需要注意的是，雅思听力的地图题一般都采用上北下南，左西右东的坐标，到目前为止还没有出现过特意打乱的情况。\n第15题答案：C\n对应原文：which tell you when certain areas are being used for particular controlled experiments and are therefore\ntemporarily out of bounds\nto the public.\n答案解析：因为录音一上来就说了almost all the year，因此这道题容易误选A。但题干中问的是关闭时间，而非开放时间，所以排除。out of bounds与closed同义替换，temporarily对应C选项中的a short time，由此确定答案。\n第16题答案：A\n对应原文： We have\nbicycles\nwhich you can hire behind the Reception block. . . here. . . the healthy ones of you can\ngo on foot and finally there’s our electric tram, powered from solar cells\n答案解析：这道题没有任何难度，只要有足够的耐心，就可以很容易确定A为答案。\n第17题答案：C\n对应原文：A good place to start on your tour is the Rare Breeds section.\nWe keep goats, sheep and hens and other kinds of poultry\n答案解析：虽然录音在后面又说了cows and horses，但句子中不仅有否定，还有thinking这一表示现在正在考虑（即现在还没有）的词汇，因此排除A和B，更加确定C为答案。\n第18题答案：B\n对应原文：not as such to preserve rare animals but\nto maintain the diversity of breeds\nto broaden the gene pool for agricultural development.\n答案解析：这道题采用了在雅思听力Section2选择题中十分常见的否定和转折的手法。只要有所提防，就不怎么会错。不过录音中的not和but读的都很轻，需要一定的识音辨音能力。\n第19题答案：C\n对应原文： for example, John Havers,\nour expert fly fisherman, is currently giving displays\non the lake.\n答案解析：这道题的解题关键在于题干上的present time。选项A和B虽然都有提到，但不是现在的事情，因此排除。而C选项正好有currently这一时间限定，因此锁定答案。不过currently读的非常快，不太容易听到。\n第20题答案：A\n对应原文：Do take time to browse around our shop. . . there is a wide selection of\nbooks on wildlife\n答案解析：虽然录音中提到了local，但对应的是authors而非tradition，因此排除B。A选项animal与wildlife同义替换，同时还对应题干中的books，由此确定答案。"

In today’s seminar, Grant Freeman, a biologist who specialises in identifying insects, and who works for the Australian Quarantine Service, has come to talk to us about his current research work. Right, well, over to you, Grant.\nGRANT:        Good morning, everyone. I’m sure that you know that the quarantine service regulates all food brought into Australia. Well, obviously they want to protect Australia from diseases that might come in with imported goods, but they also want to prevent insect pests from being introduced into the country, and that’s where I have a part to play. Anyway, my current research involves trying to find a particular type of bee, the Asian Honey Bee, and finding out whether there are any of them around in various states of Australia. We discovered a few of them in\nQueensland\n(\nQ21\n) once and eradicated them. Now, we’re pretty keen to make sure that there aren’t any more getting in, particularly to New South Wales and other states.\nSTUDENT 1:     What’s wrong with Asian Honey Bees? Are they so different from Australian bees?\nGRANT:        Well, in fact, they look almost the same, but\nthey are infested with mites\n(\nQ22\n) – microscopic creatures which live on them, and which can seriously damage our own home-grown bees, or could even wipe them out.\nPROFESSOR:    Well, what would happen if Australian bees died out?\nGRANT:        Well, the honey from Australian bees is of excellent quality, much better than the stuff the Asian bees produce. In fact,\nAustralia exports native Queen bees to a large number of countries because of this\n(\nQ23\n). When the European Honey Bee was first discovered out in the bush, we found they made really unpleasant honey and they were also too big to pollinate many of our native flowers here in Australia.\nSTUDENT 2:     That must have had a devastating effect on the natural flora. Did you lose any species?\nGRANT:        NO, we managed to get them under control before that happened but if Asian bees got in there could be other consequences.\nWe could lose a lot of money\n(\nQ24\n) because you might not be aware, but it’s estimated that native bees’ pollination of flower and vegetable crops is worth 1. 2 billion dollars a year. So in a way they’re the farmers’ friend. Oh, and another thing is, if you’re stung by an Asian Honey Bee, it can produce an allergic reaction in some people; so they’re much more dangerous than native bees.\nPROFESSOR:    HOW will you know if Asian bees have entered Australia?\nGRANT:        We’re looking at the diet of the bird called the Rainbow Bee Eater. The Bee Eater doesn’t care what it eats, as long as they’re\ninsects\n(\nQ25\n). But the interesting thing about this bird is that we are able to analyse—exactly what it eats and that’s really helpful if we’re looking for introduced insects.\nPROFESSOR:    How come?\nGRANT:        Because insects have their skeletons outside their bodies, so the Bee Eaters digest the meat from the inside. Then they bring up all the indigestible bits of skeleton and, of course, the wings in a pellet – a small ball of waste material which they cough up.\nPROFESSOR:    That sounds a bit unpleasant. So, how do you go about it?\nGRANT:        In the field We track down the Bee Eaters and find their favourite\nfeeding\n(\nQ26\n) spots, you know, the places where the birds usually feed. It’s here that we can find the pellets. We collect them up and take them back to the\nlaboratory\n(\nQ27\n) to examine the contents.\nPROFESSOR:    HOW do you do that?\nGRANT:        The pellets are really hard, especially if they have been out in the sun for a few days so, first of all, we treat them by adding\nwater\n(\nQ28\n) to moisten them and make them softer. Then we pull them apart under the microscope. Everything’s all scrunched up but we’re looking for wings so we just pull them all out and straighten them. Then we identify them to see if we can find any Asian bee\nwings\n(\nQ29\n).\nPROFESSOR:    And how many have you found?\nGRANT:        So far our research shows that Asian bees have not entered Australia in any number- it’s a good result and much more\nreliable\n(\nQ30\n) than trying to find live ones as evidence of introduced insects.\nPROFESSOR:    Well, that’s fascinating! Thank you, Grant, for those insights. I hope that you might inspire some of our students here to conduct some similar experiments.\n剑8 test 2 Section 3雅思听力答案\n21. A\n22. B\n23. C\n24.

We discovered a few of them in\nQueensland\nonce\n答案解析：录音中说到在Queensland发现过亚洲蜜蜂。虽然后面也提到了New South Wales，但说的是很确定那里没有，因此排除B，选A。\n第22题答案：B\n对应原文：Well, in fact, they look almost the same, but\nthey are infested with mites\n– microscopic creatures which live on them, and which can seriously damage our own home-grown bees, or could even wipe them out.\n答案解析：这道题要稍微绕一些。录音中说的是亚洲蜜蜂身上带有一种寄生虫，寄生虫可能会伤害到本地蜜蜂，而非亚洲蜜蜂会伤害到本地蜜蜂，因此排除A，选B。\n第23题答案：C\n对应原文：In fact,\nAustralia exports native Queen bees to a large number of countries because of this\n答案解析：B选项所描述的对象其实是欧洲蜜蜂，因此排除。录音中说澳大利亚的蜂蜜质量很好，没有提到差异很大，因此排除A。C选项将原文中的export替换为be sold to customers abroad，由此确定答案。\n第24题答案：A\n对应原文： but if Asian bees got in there could be other consequences.\nWe could lose a lot of money\n答案解析：选项B完全没有提到，因此排除。录音中说农业会受到影响，而非受益，因此排除C。A选项将原文中的lose a lot of money替换为经济受到影响，由此确定答案。\n第25题答案：insects\n对应原文：We’re looking at the diet of the bird called the Rainbow Bee Eater. The Bee Eater doesn’t care what it eats, as long as they’re\ninsects\n答案解析：听到rainbow bee eater意识到答案即将到来。as long as与空前词only同义替换，由此确定答案为insects。\n第26题答案：feeding/eating\n对应原文：In the field We track down the Bee Eaters and find their favourite\nfeeding\nspots\n答案解析：这道题难度要稍微大一些。录音中没有出现明确的提示词。虽然location与spot同义替换，但位置却从空前变成了答案后，容易让人反应不过来。\n第27题答案：laboratory\n对应原文： We collect them up and take them back to the\nlaboratory\nto examine the contents.\n答案解析：题干中的collect和take them都没有任何改变，可以比较容易的确定答案是laboratory。不过录音中这个单词采用英式读法，一些同学可能会不太适应。\n第28题答案：water\n对应原文：The pellets are really hard, especially if they have been out in the sun for a few days so, first of all, we treat them by adding\nwater\nto moisten them and make them softer\n答案解析：虽然这道题空在句首，也没有很明显的提示词。但录音中water读的很重，而且后面还跟着softer（与题干中soften对应），比较容易确定答案。\n第29题答案：wings\n对应原文：Then we identify them to see if we can find any Asian bee\nwings\n答案解析：考察look for与find这一我们从小就比较熟悉的同义替换。\n第30题答案：reliable/accurate\n对应原文：it’s a good result and much more\nreliable\nthan trying to find live ones as evidence of introduced insects.\n答案解析：主要根据空前more来锁定reliable这一答案。"

I want to talk about the rationale behind what I decided to do.\nNow I had to set up my programme of research in three different countries so\nI approached postgraduates in my field in overseas departments\n(\nQ31\n)\n, contacting them by email, to organise things for me at their end. I thought I would have trouble recruiting help but in fact everyone was very willing and sometimes their tutors got involved too.\nI had to give my helpers clear instructions about what kind of sample population I wanted them to use. I decided that people under 18 should be excluded because most of them are students or looking for their first job, and also I decided at this stage just to\nfocus on men who were in employment\n(\nQ32\n)\n, and set up something for people who didn’t have jobs and for employed women later on as a separate investigation.\nI specifically wanted to do a questionnaire, and interviews with a focus group. With the questionnaire, rather than limiting it to one specific point,\nI wanted to include as much variety as possible\n(Q33)\n. I know questionnaires are a very controlled way to do things but I thought I could do taped interviews later on to counteract the effects of this. And the focus group may also prove useful in future, by targeting subjects I can easily return to, as the participants tend to be more involved.\nSo I’m just collating the results now. At the moment it looks as if, in the UK,\ndespite the fact that newspapers continually report that people are unhappy with medical care, in fact it is mainly the third level of care, which takes place in hospitals, that they are worried about  (Q34)\n. Government reforms have been proposed at all levels and although their success is not guaranteed, long-term hospital care is in fact probably less of an issue than the media would have us believe. However, I’ve still got quite a bit of data to look at.\nCertainly, I will need to do more far-reaching research than I had anticipated\nin order to establish if people want extra medical staff invested in the community, or if they want care to revert to fewer but larger, key medical units\n(Q35)\n. The solution may well be something that can be easily implemented by those responsible in local government, with central government support of course.\nThis first stage has proved very valuable though. I was surprised by how willing most of the subjects were to get involved in the project – I had expected some unwillingness to answer questions honestly. But I was taken aback and rather concerned that something I thought I’d set up very well\ndidn’t necessarily seem that way to everyone in my own department\n(Q36)\n.\nI thought you might also be interested in some of the problems I encountered in collecting my data. There were odd cases that threw me – one of the subjects who I had approached while he was out shopping in town,\ndecided to pull out when it came to the second round (Q37)\n. It was a shame as it was someone who I would like to have interviewed more closely. And one of the first-year students I interviewed\nwanted reassurance that no names would be traceable from the answers\n(Q38)\n. I was so surprised, because they think nothing of telling you about themselves and their opinions in seminar groups!\nThen, one of the people that I work with got a bit funny. The questions were quite personal and\none minute he said he’d do it, then the next day he wouldn’t, and in the end he did do it (Q39)\n. It’s hard not to get angry in that situation but I tried to keep focused on the overall picture in order to stay calm.\nThe most bizarre case was a telephone interview I did with a teacher at a university in France. He answered all my questions in great detail – but then when I asked how much access he had to dangerous substances\nhe wouldn’t tell me exactly what his work involved (Q40)\n. It’s a real eye-opener. . .\n剑8 test 2 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31. B\n32. B\n33. A\n34. A\n35. C\n36. C\n37. B\n38. F\n39. D\n40. C"

They mostly belong to families who are working abroad at the moment. What about the location?\nMAN:          It’d be nice to be\ncentral (Q1)\n.\nWOMAN:       That might be difficult, as most houses of that size are in the suburbs. Still, there are a few. What’s your upper limit for the rent?\nMAN:          We’d like something around ￡500 a month, but we could go up to\n￡600 (Q2)\nif  we have to. But we can’t go beyond that.\nWOMAN:       Do you know how long you want to rent the house for? The minimum let is six months, as you probably realise.\nMAN:          We’re at college here for\ntwo years\n(Q3)\n, and we don’t want to have to move during that time if we can avoid it.\nWOMAN:       Right. And how soon do you want to move in? All our lets start on the first of the month.\nMAN:          Well, as soon as possible, really, so that means September 1st\nWOMAN:       Okay, let me have a look at what we’ve got…. We have photographs of all the houses on our books, so you can get an idea of what they’re like. There’s this one in Oakington Avenue, at ￡550 a month. Combined living room and dining room, with a separate kitchen. It doesn’t have a\ngarage (Q4)\n, though you can park in the road.\nMAN:          Ah, we’d prefer to have one, if possible.\nWOMAN:       Right. Then have a look at this house, in Mead Street. It’s got a very large living room and kitchen, bathroom, cloakroom. . .\nMAN:          How much is it?\nWOMAN:       That one’s 580. It’s very well furnished and equipped. It also has plenty of space for parking, and it’s available for a minimum of a year. Oh, and there’s a big\ngarden (Q5)\n.\nMAN:          I don’t think we could cope with that, to be honest. We’ll be too busy to look after it.\nWOMAN:       Okay. Then there’s this older house in Hamilton Road: living room, kitchen-diner, and it has a\nstudy (Q6)\n. 550 a month.\nMAN:          That looks rather nice. But whereabouts in Hamilton Road?\nWOMAN:       Towards the western end.\nMAN:          Oh, that’ll be very\nnoisy (Q7)\n. I know the area.\nWOMAN:       Yes, it’s pretty lively. Some people like it, though. Well, what about this house in Devon Close?\nMAN:          That looks lovely.\nWOMAN:       There’s a big demand for houses in that area, so prices tend to be quite high. But this one hasn’t been decorated for a few years, which has kept the rent down a bit. It’s got a living room, dining room and small kitchen, and it’s\n595\n(Q8)\na month. I think it would suit you, from what you’ve said.\nMAN:          It sounds fine.\nMAN:          Why’s that part of town so popular?\nWOMAN:       Well, there’s a big scheme to improve the district, and it’ll soon have the best facilities for miles around.\nMAN:          What sort of thing?\nWOMAN:       There’s a big sports centre under construction, which will be very impressive when it’s finished.

Oh, and there’s a big\ngarden\n答案解析：这道题采用语序调换的手法，将原本位于空后的large替换为big，并放在答案之前。需要大家看题的时候能够有所警觉。\n第6题答案：study\n对应原文：Then there’s this older house in Hamilton Road: living room, kitchen-diner, and it has a\nstudy\n答案解析：study在这里并不表示学习，而是书房的意思。\n第7题答案：noisy\n对应原文：Oh, that’ll be very\nnoisy\n答案解析：考察too与very的同义替换。另外这道题填女性后来说的lively也是可以说的过去的。\n第8题答案：595\n对应原文：It’s got a living room, dining room and small kitchen, and it’s\n595\na month\n答案解析：从空前的货币符号可以很容易的判断出空上应该填一个数字，而且录音中也没有设置任何干扰项，只要对数字足够熟悉即可。\n第9题答案：B\n对应原文： I think I heard something about a plan to replace\nthe existing concert hall\nwith a larger one\n答案解析：不少同学听到replace和larger one就直接排除了B，但一方面男性说的plan，即计划。可见现在还没有开始动工；另一方面，concert hall前面也有existing这一形容词，表示它现在还存在。因此确定为正确答案。\n第10题答案：E\n对应原文： In fact,\nthe swimming pool’s already opened\n, ahead of schedule, and it’s attracting a lot of people.\n答案解析：录音中明确提到游泳池已经开了，而且还吸引了不少人，由此锁定答案。"

I’m your host – Dave Green – and this is your very own local radio programme. Every Friday evening we put the spotlight on different arts and culture facilities and look at the shows and events that are on offer in the coming week.\nAnd today the focus is on The National Arts Centre. Now, if you don’t already know it yourself, I’m sure you’ve all heard of it. It’s famous throughout the world\nas one of the major venues for\nclassical music (Q11)\n.\nBut did you know that it is actually much more than just a place to hear concerts? The Centre itself is a huge complex that caters for a great range of arts. Under a single roof, it houses concert rooms, theatres, cinemas, art galleries and a wonderful public library, as well as service facilities including three restaurants and a\nbookshop (Q12)\n. So at any one time, the choice of entertainment there is simply enormous.\nSo, how did they manage to build such a big arts complex right in the heart of the city? Well, the area was completely destroyed by bombs during the war in 1940. So the opportunity was taken to create a cultural centre that would be, what they called: ‘the City’s gift to the Nation’. Of course, it took a while for such a big project to get started, but it was\nplanned (Q13)\nin the 60s, built in the 70s and eventually opened to the public in\n1983 (Q14)\n. Ever since then it has proved to be a great success. It is not privately owned, like many arts centres, but is still in public hands – it’s run by the\nCity Council (Q15\n)\n. Both our National Symphony Orchestra and National Theatre Company were involved in the planning of the project, and they are now based there – giving regular performances every week – and as the Centre is open\n363 (Q16)\ndays of the year, there are plenty of performances to choose from.\nSo, to give you some idea of what’s on, and to help you choose from the many possibilities, we’ve made a selection of the star attractions.\nIf you’re interested in classical music, then we recommend you go along to the National on either Monday or Tuesday evening at 7.30 for a spectacular production of ‘The Magic Flute’- probably the most popular of all Mozart’s operas. It’s in\nthe Garden Hall (Q17)\nand tickets start at only ￡8. 00, but you’ll have to be early if you want to get them that cheap! And remember, it’s only on for those two evenings.\nFor those more interested in the cinema, you might like to see the new Canadian film which is showing on Wednesday evening at 8 pm in Cinema 2. And that’s called\n‘Three Lives (Q18)\n. ‘ It’s had fantastic reviews and tickets cost just\n￡4.50 (Q19)\n, which is a reduction on the usual price of ￡5. 50. So, it’s really good value, especially for such a great movie.\nBut you can see the centre’s main attraction at the weekend, because on Saturday and Sunday, 11 am to 10 pm, they’re showing a wonderful new exhibition that hasn’t been seen anywhere else in Europe yet. It s a collection of Chinese Art called\n‘Faces of China’ (Q20)\n– that’s in Gallery 1 – and it has some really fascinating paintings and sculptures by leading artists from all over China – and the good news is that it is completely free, so don’t miss it! So why not go along to the National Arts Centre next week for one – or all – of these great events – and you can always pick up a programme and check out all the other performances and exhibitions on offer, or coming soon, on almost every day of the year. Next week we’ll be looking at the new Museum of Science. . .\n剑8 test 3 Section 2雅思听力答案\n11. classical music\n12. bookshop/bookstore\n13. planned\n14. 1983\n15. city council\n16. 363\n17.

It’s famous throughout the world as one of the major venues for\nclassical music\n答案解析：这道题考察famous与well known的同义替换。虽然famous与classical music之间还隔了几个单词，但他们填在空上并不合适，因此还是比较容易锁定答案的。\n第12题答案：bookshop/bookstore\n对应原文： art galleries and a wonderful public library, as well as service facilities including three restaurants and a\nbookshop\n答案解析：几乎相当于是送分题，直接按照文章来自老烤鸭雅思并列顺序将答案说了出来。唯一需要注意的是bookshop要合起来写，不能分开。\n第13题答案：planned\n对应原文：Of course, it took a while for such a big project to get started, but it was\nplanned\nin the 60s\n答案解析：题目采用语序颠倒的手法，将原本位于空前的1960s这一提示词放在了答案之后，而且还没有说全。再加上语速较快，特别容易反应不过来。除了凭借扎实的基本功回忆之外，我们也可以在听之前根据场景琢磨琢磨空上大体填什么内容，这样能够有效降低难度。\n第14题答案：1983/(the) 1980s\n对应原文：built in the 70s and eventually opened to the public in\n1983\n答案解析：这道题有两个难点。一是离13题太近，很容易还在思考13题填什么，14题就过去了。二是1983之间存在连读，容易听成1993.\n第15题答案：City Council\n对应原文：It is not privately owned, like many arts centres, but is still in public hands – it’s run by the\nCity Council\n答案解析：考察run与manage的同义替换。council一次在雅思听力中经常出现，常见的搭配除了city council之外，还有local council等。\n第16题答案：363\n对应原文： as the Centre is open\n363\ndays of the year, there are plenty of performances to choose from.\n答案解析：单纯的考察数字，只要多加练习就没有什么太大难度。\n第17题答案：(the) Garden Hall\n对应原文：probably the most popular of all Mozart’s operas. It’s in\nthe Garden Hall\n答案解析：听到Mozar’s operas意识到答案即将到来，in提示后面跟的是地点。不过hall因为本身发音的问题，可能会不太好识别一些。\n第18题答案：Three Lives\n对应原文：you might like to see the new Canadian film which is showing on Wednesday evening at 8 pm in Cinema 2. And that’s called\nThree Lives\n答案解析：这道题涉及到听力中的一点小技巧。一般而言，如果听力中问到name, type和event的话，录音中的答案都会出现在called后面，大家可以根据这一点来定位。\n第19题答案：4.50\n对应原文：It’s had fantastic reviews and tickets cost just\n￡4.50\n答案解析：直接考察数字，没有设置任何干扰项。只需要能够区分十几和几十即可。\n第20题答案：Faces of China\n对应原文：It s a collection of Chinese Art called\n‘Faces of China’\n答案解析：跟18题的考察套路相似，利用called定位即可。一些同学可能会写成Chinese Art。但它一方面不算是名称，没办法加引号；另一方面art跟题干有重复，因此排除。"

First, let’s talk about your work experience in South America. What took you there? Was it to gain more fluency in Spanish?\nPAUL:         Well, as I’m combining Spanish with Latin American studies, my main idea was\nto find out more about the way people lived there (Q21)\n. My spoken Spanish was already pretty good in fact.\nWOMAN:       So you weren’t too worried about language barriers?\nPAUL:         No. In fact, I ended up teaching English there, although that wasn’t my original choice of work.\nWOMAN:       I see. How did you find out about all this?\nPAUL:         I found an agency that runs all kinds of voluntary projects in South America.\nWOMAN:       What kind of work?\nPAUL:         Well, there were several possibilities.\nWOMAN:       YOU mean construction? Engineering work?\nPAUL:         Yes, getting involved in building projects was an option. Then there was\ntourism – taking tourists for walks around the volcanoes – which I actually chose to do (Q22)\n, and then there was work with local farmers.\nWOMAN:       But you didn’t continue with that project. Why not?\nPAUL:         Because I never really knew whether I’d be needed or not. I’d thought it might be difficult physically, but I was certainly fit enough. . . no,\nI wanted to do something that had more of a proper structure to it (Q23)\n, I suppose. I get de-motivated otherwise.\nWOMAN:       What do you think you learned from your experience? It must have been a great opportunity to examine community life.\nPAUL:         Yes, but it was difficult at first to be accepted by the locals. It was a very remote village and some of them were reluctant to speak to me – although they were always interested in my clothes and how much I’d had to pay for them.\nWOMAN:       Well, that’s understandable.\nPAUL:         Yes, but things soon improved.\nWhat struck me was that when people became more comfortable with me and less suspicious (Q24)\n, we really connected with each other in a meaningful way.\nWOMAN:       YOU made good friends?\nPAUL:         Yes, with two of the families in particular.\nWOMAN:       Good. What about management. Did you have a project manager?\nPAUL:         Yes and\nhe gave me lots of advice and guidance (Q25)\n.\nWOMAN:       And was he good at managing too?\nPAUL:         That wasn’t his strong point! I think he was often more interested in the academic side of things than filing reports. He was a bit of a dreamer.\nWOMAN:       And did you have a contract?\nPAUL:         I had to stay for a minimum of three months. My parents were surprised when I asked to stay longer – six months in the end. I was so happy there.\nWOMAN:       And did anything on the administration side of things surprise you? What was the food and lodging like?\nPAUL:         Simple. . . but there was plenty to eat and I only paid seven dollars a day for that which was amazing really. And they gave me all the equipment I needed. . .\neven a laptop\n.\nWOMAN:\nYou didn’t expect that then?\nPAUL:\nNO  (Q26)\n.\nWOMAN:       Well, I’ll look forward to hearing more.\nWOMAN:       But now let’s look at these modules. You’ll need to start thinking about which ones you’ll definitely want to study. The first one here is Gender Studies in Latin America.\nPAUL:         Mmm. . .\nWOMAN:       It looks at how gender analysis is reconfiguring civil society in Latin America. Women are increasingly occupying positions in government and in other elected leadership positions in Latin America. I think you’d find it interesting.\nPAUL:\nIf it was to do with people in the villages rather than those in the public sphere, I would (Q27)\n.\nWOMAN:       Okay. What about Second Language Acquisition?\nPAUL:         Do you think rd find that useful?\nWOMAN:       Well, you’ve had some practical experience in the field, I think it would be.\nPAUL:         I hadn’t thought about that.\nI’ll put that down as a definite, then (Q28)\n.\nWOMAN:       Okay. What about Indigenous Women’s Lives. That sounds appropriate.\nPAUL:         I thought so too, but I looked at last year’s exam questions and that changed my mind.\nWOMAN:       Don’t judge the value of the course on that. Maybe, talk to some other students first\nand we can talk about it again later (Q29)\n.\nPAUL:\nOkay.\nWOMAN:       Yes. And lastly, will you sign up for Portuguese lessons?\nPAUL:         My Spanish is good, so would I find that module easy?\nWOMAN:       Not necessarily. Some people find that Spanish interferes with learning Portuguese. . . getting the accent right too. It’s quite different in a lot of ways.\nPAUL:\nWell, I’d much sooner do something else, then.

In the last few lectures, I’ve been dealing with business finance, but now I’m going to move on to business systems. And in today’s lecture, I’m going to talk about what can go wrong when businesses try to copy their own best practices. Once a business has successfully introduced a new process – managing a branch bank, say, or selling a new product – the parent organisation naturally wants to repeat that success, and capture it if possible on a bigger scale. The goal, then, is to utilise existing knowledge and not to generate new knowledge. It’s a less glamorous activity than pure innovation, but\nit actually happens more often (Q31)\n, as a matter of fact. However, surprisingly, getting things right the second time is not necessarily any simpler than it was the first time. Now, there’s been a lot of research into how companies can repeat their previous successes, and it certainly hasn’t been confined to the United States. It seems that most large industries are trying to repeat their own successes, and manage the knowledge they’ve acquired – but even so, it has been shown that the overwhelming majority of attempts fail.\nA host of studies confirm this, covering a wide range of business setting (Q32)\n: branch banks, retail stores, real estate agencies, factories, call centres. . . to name but a few.\nSo why do so few managers get things right the second or third time? Let’s consider one reason for failure – placing too much trust in the people who are running the successful operation, the ‘experts’ shall we say. Managers who want to apply existing knowledge typically start off by going to an expert – such as the person who designed and is running a successful department store – and picking their brains.\nNow, this approach can be used if you want to gain a rough understanding of a particular system, or understand smaller, isolated problems (Q33)\n. The trouble is, even the expert doesn’t fully grasp the whole thing because when it comes to complex systems, the individual components of the process are interwoven with one another. The expert never has complete access to the necessary information. And the situation’s complicated even further by the fact that experts are usually not aware of their own ignorance. The ignorance can take various forms. For instance, a lot of details of the system are invisible to managers.\nSome may be difficult to describe (Q34)\n– learned on the job and well known by workers perhaps, but impossible to describe in a way that’s helpful. And there are some things that people know or do that they’re not even aware of.\nNow, let’s consider two types of mistake that can occur when a manager actually starts to set up a duplicate system to replicate a successful process. Firstly, perhaps he forgets that he was just trying to copy another process, and starts trying to improve on it. Another mistake is trying to use the best parts of various different systems, in the hope of creating the perfect\ncombination (Q35)\n.\nUnfortunately, attempts like these usually turn out to be misguided and lead to problems. Why? Well, for various reasons. Perhaps there weren’t really any advantages after all, because the information wasn’t accurate. Or perhaps the business settings weren’t really comparable. More typically, the advantages are real enough, but there are also disadvantages that have been overlooked. For example, the modifications might compromise\nsafety (Q36)\nin some way.\nSo, what’s the solution? Well, I don’t intend to suggest that it’s easy to get things right the second time. . . it’s not. But the underlying problem has more to do with attitudes than the actual difficulty of the task, and there are ways of getting it right. These involve adjusting\nattitudes (Q37)\n, first of all. . . being more realistic and cautious really. Secondly, they involve exerting strict\ncontrols (Q38)\non the organisational and operational systems. And this, in turn, means copying the original as closely as possible. Not merely duplicating the physical characteristics of the\nfactory (Q39)\n, but also duplicating the\nskills (40)\nthat the original employees had. Reliance on a template like this offers the huge advantage of built-in consistency.\n剑8 test 3 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31. B\n32. B\n33. B\n34.

For example, the modifications might compromise\nsafety\nin some way.\n答案解析：听到overlook与for example意识到答案即将到来。从题干中可以推测空上填的应该是个名词，而modifications又与change对应，由此确定答案为safety。\n第37题答案：attitude(s)\n对应原文： there are ways of getting it right. These involve adjusting\nattitudes\n, first of all\n答案解析：这道题有意将first of all这一提示放在了答案之后，但adjust与change对应，attitudes读的又很重，确定答案并不是太难。\n第38题答案：control(s)\n对应原文：Secondly, they involve exerting strict\ncontrols\non the organisational and operational systems\n答案解析：听到secondly意识到答案即将到来，strict与rigorous同义替换，由此确定答案为controls。\n第39题答案：factory/factories\n对应原文：Not merely duplicating the physical characteristics of the\nfactory\n答案解析：physical原词出现，characteristics与features同义替换，由此确定factory\n第40题答案：skills\n对应原文： but also duplicating the\nskills\nthat the original employees had.\n答案解析：题目本身没有任何难度，但跟上一题的factory距离过近，一不留神就会漏听。"

Could you tell me what kind of staff you are looking for?\nWOMAN:       We’re looking for\nwaiters (Q1)\nat the moment. There was one post for a cook,   but that’s already been taken.\nMAN:              Oh right. Erm, what are the hours of work?\nWOMAN:       There are two different shifts – there’s a day shift from 7 to 2 and a late shift from 4 till 11.\nMAN:              And can people choose which one they want to do?\nWOMAN:       Not normally, because everyone would choose the day shift I suppose.

What about time off?\nWOMAN:       You get one\nday off\n(Q2)\nand I think you can negotiate which one you want, it’s more or less up to you.

Do I need a waistcoat or anything?\nWOMAN:       YOU have to wear a\njacket\n(Q6)\n, but the hotel lends you that.\nMAN:              I see.

There was one post for a cook,   but that’s already been taken.\n答案解析：在正确答案后面设置了小小的干扰项-cook，然后又用but否定掉。属于Section1中十分常见的套路。\n第2题答案：day off\n对应原文：You get one\nday off\nand I think you can negotiate which one you want\n答案解析：这道题比较难一些，不少同学会看把shift当成答案写上去，但看看上一行就明白，这属于题干上的已知信息，不能作为答案。还有的同学会认为男性说的time off是答案，但他是在提问而不是在回答，还是要看看女性说什么才行。\n第3题答案：break\n对应原文：Yes, I’ve got them here. You get ￡5. 50 an hour, and that includes a\nbreak\n答案解析：没有任何难度，属于送分题。不过大家要注意brake和break的区分。二者读音完全一样，前者表示刹车，而后者表示休息，只能根据场景和上下文来判断。\n第4题答案：(free) meal\n对应原文：You don’t have to. You can get a\nmeal\nin the hotel if you want to\n答案解析：单词不算太难，但meal和后面的in出现连读，听起来有点像mealion，比较考察大家的听音辨音能力。\n第5题答案：dark (coloured/colored)\n对应原文：You need to wear a white shirt, just a plain one, and\ndark\ntrousers\n答案解析：听到white shirt意识到答案即将到来，trousers原词出现，根据修饰关系确定dark为答案。\n第6题答案：jacket\n对应原文：You have to wear a\njacket\n, but the hotel lends you that.\n答案解析：顺着上一道题目往下听，只有jacket一词符合题干上dress的要求，由此确定答案。\n第7题答案：28 June\n对应原文：Just a minute, I think it’s some time\naround the end of June. Yes, the 28th,\nin time for the summer.\n答案解析：从题干上可以推测空上填的是个日期。不过这道题比较别致的地方在于，它将月和日分开来说，可能会造成一些同学反应不过来。\n第8题答案：Urwin\n对应原文：Her name’s Jane Urwin, that’s\nU-R-W-I-N\n, and she’ll probably arrange to meet you.\n答案解析：考察姓名拼写，属于送分题。\n第9题答案：12.00 (pm)/noon/mid-day\n对应原文： Could you call tomorrow? Urn, she usually starts checking the rooms at\nmidday\n, so before then if you can\n,\nso she’ll have more time to chat.\n答案解析：midday表示中午，正午的意思，属于雅思听力中经常考察的知识点，会在选择题中与noon进行同义替换。mid和day合起来写，加连字符都可以。\n第10题答案：reference\n对应原文：And by the way, she will ask you for a\nreference\n, so you might like to be thinking about that.\n答案解析：ask与require同义替换，由此确定reference为答案。它在求职场景中往往表示推荐信，而在学术场景中则多表示参考资料。"

With me today is Graham Campbell, a councillor from the city council. He will be telling us about the plan to improve the fast-growing suburb of Red Hill. Good morning Graham and welcome to the show.\nGRAHAM:       Good morning, Carol.\nCAROL:            NOW, Graham, I understand that there has been a lot of community consultation for the new plan?\nGRAHAM:       Yes, we’ve tried to address some of the concerns that local groups told us about. People we’ve heard from are mainly worried about traffic in the area, and, in particular, the increasing speed of cars near schools.\nThey feel that it is only a matter of time before there is an accident as a lot of the children walk to the school. So we’re trying to do something about that\n(Q11)\n.\nAnother area of concern is the overhead power lines. These are very old and a lot of people we spoke to asked if something could be done about them. Well, I’m happy to report that the power company have agreed\nto move the power lines underground (Q12)\nat a cost of $800, 000. I think that will really improve the look of the area, as well as being safer.\nCAROL:            That’s good to know, but will that mean an increase in rates for the local businesses in that area?\nGRAHAM:       Well,\nthe power company have agreed to bear the cost of this (Q13)\nthemselves after a lot of discussion with the council. This is wonderful news as the council now has some extra funds for us to put into other things like tree planting and art work.\nGRAHAM:       NOW, we’ve also put together a map which we’ve sent out to all the residents in the area. And on the map we’ve marked the proposed changes. Firstly, we’ll plant mature pine trees to provide shelter and shade just\nto the right of the supermarket in Days Road (Q14\n)\n. In order to address the traffic problems, the pavements\non the corner of Carberry and Thomas Street will be widened (Q15)\n. This will help to reduce the speed of vehicles entering Thomas Street. We think it’s very important to separate the local residential streets from the main road.\nSo the roadway at the entry to Thomas Street from Days Road will be painted red (Q16)\n. This should mark it more clearly and act as a signal for traffic to slow down. One way of making sure that the pedestrians are safe is to increase signage at the intersections. A ‘keep clear’ sign will be erected\nat the junction of Evelyn Street and Hill Street (Q17)\n, to enable traffic to exit at all times. Something we’re planning to do to help control the flow of traffic in the area is\nto install traffic lights half way down Hill Street where it crosses Days Road (Q18)\n. Now, we haven’t only thought about the cars and traffic, of course, there’s also something for the children. We’re going to get school children in the area to research a local story, the life of a local sports hero perhaps, and an artist will incorporate that story into paintings\non the wall of a building on the other side of Hill Street from the supermarket (Q19)\n. And finally, we’ve agreed to build a new children’s playground which will be\nat the other end of Hill Street close to the intersection with Carberry Street (Q20)\n.\nCAROL:            Wonderful, now, what’s the next stage?\nGRAHAM:       Well, the final plan. . .\n剑8 test 4 Section 2雅思听力答案\n11.

So we’re trying to do something about that\n答案解析：录音中提到，当地人主要关心的还是孩子走路上学的安全问题，而A选项中的pedestrian则是行人的意思，由此确定答案。录音中说的是车速太快，而不是交通拥堵，因此排除B。C选项完全没有提到，同样排除。\n第12题答案：B\n对应原文：Well, I’m happy to report that the power company have agreed\nto move the power lines underground\n答案解析：这道题主要考察underground与buried的同义替换。不过因为underground在录音中读的很弱，所以不太好识别。难度较大。\n第13题答案：B\n对应原文： Well,\nthe power company have agreed to bear the cost of this\nthemselves after a lot of discussion with the council.\n答案解析：女性问了一下是否由当地公司承担，被男性所否认，因此排除C。录音中说的是，在于委员会多轮磋商之后，电力公司最终决定支付费用。因此确定B为答案，排除A。\n第14题答案：C\n对应原文：Firstly, we’ll plant mature pine trees to provide shelter and shade just\nto the right of the supermarket in Days Road\n答案解析：录音中提到，树木的位置位于超市右侧，Days Road上，符合这一条件的之后C选项，由此确定答案。\n第15题答案：D\n对应原文：the pavements\non the corner of Carberry and Thomas Street will be widened\n答案解析：根据Carberry和Thomas Street的交叉口，确定答案为D。\n第16题答案：G\n对应原文：\nSo the roadway at the entry to Thomas Street from Days Road will be painted red\n答案解析：虽然录音中关于entry的说法稍微有些复杂，但只要我们听到Thomas Street和Days Road就会发现只有G选项符合条件。\n第17题答案：B\n对应原文： A ‘keep clear’ sign will be erected\nat the junction of Evelyn Street and Hill Street\n答案解析：同样是根据两条路的名字确定答案为B\n第18题答案：F\n对应原文：we’re planning to do to help control the flow of traffic in the area is\nto install traffic lights half way down Hill Street where it crosses Days Road\n答案解析：与之前题目类似，根据hill street和days road这两条路锁定F选项所在的位置。\n第19题答案：A\n对应原文：an artist will incorporate that story into paintings\non the wall of a building on the other side of Hill Street from the supermarket\n答案解析：根据录音中的描述，艺术作品位于hill street，超市的对面的墙上，由此确定A为答案。\n第20题答案：E\n对应原文：And finally, we’ve agreed to build a new children’s playground which will be\nat the other end of Hill Street close to the intersection with Carberry Street\n答案解析：根据Hill street与Carberry Street的交叉口，确定答案为E。"

How’s it going?\nJEANNIE:       Oh, hello Dan. Pretty well, thanks. Have you managed to get the money for the course yet?\nDAN:          Yes, that’s all sorted out now, thanks. It took long enough, though. It was practically a year ago that I applied to my local council for a grant, and it took them six months to turn me down.\nJEANNIE:       That’s really slow.\nDAN:          And I thought I was eligible for government funding, but it seems I was mistaken. So then I asked the boss of the company I used to work for if they would sponsor me, and much to my surprise,\nhe said they’d make a contribution (Q21)\n.\nJEANNIE:       But what about college grants and scholarships? There must be some you could apply for.\nDAN:          Yes, there are, but they’re all so small that I decided to leave them until I was desperate.\nJEANNIE:       Uhuh.\nDAN:          And in fact I didn’t need to apply. My parents had been saying that as I already had a job, I ought to support myself through college.\nBut in the end they took pity on me, so now I’ve just about got enough (Q22)\n.\nJEANNIE:      That’s good.\nDAN:          SO now I can put a bit of effort into meeting people – I haven’t had time so far. Any suggestions?\nJEANNIE:      What about joining some college clubs?\nDAN:          Oh right. You joined several didn’t you?\nJEANNIE:       Yes, I’m in the drama club. It’s our first performance next week, so we’re rehearsing frantically, and I’ve got behind with my work, but it’s worth it. I’m hoping to be in the spring production, too.\nDAN:          I’ve never liked acting. Are you doing anything else?\nJEANNIE:       I enjoyed singing when I was at school, so I joined a group when I came to college.\nI don’t think the conductor stretches us enough (Q23)\n, though so I’ll give up after the next concert. And I also joined the debating society. It’s fun, but\nwith all the rehearsing I’m doing, something has to go (Q24)\n, and I’m afraid that’s the one.\nDAN:          DO you do any sports?\nJEANNIE:       Yes, I’m in one of the hockey teams. I’m not very good, but I’d really miss it if I stopped. I decided to try tennis when I came to college, and I’m finding it pretty tough going. I’m simply not fit enough.\nDAN:          Nor me. I think I’ll give that a miss!\nJEANNIE:       I’m hoping it’ll help me to build up my stamina, but it’ll probably be a long haul.\nDAN:          Good luck.\nJEANNIE:       Thanks.\nDAN:          How are you finding the course?\nJEANNIE:       I wish we had more seminars.\nDAN:          What? I’d have thought we had more than enough already. All those people saying clever things that I could never think of – it’s quite interesting, but\nI wonder if I’m clever enough\n(Q25)\nto be doing this course.\nJEANNIE:       I find it helpful to listen to the other people. I like the way we’re exploring the subject, and working towards getting insight into it.\nDAN:          HOW do you get on with your tutor? I don’t think I’m on the same wavelength as mine, so I feel I’m not getting anything out of the tutorials. It would be more productive to read a book instead.\nJEANNIE:       Oh, mine’s very demanding. She gives me lots of feedback and advice,\nso I’ve got much better at writing essays. And she’s helping me plan my revision for the end-of-year exams (Q26)\n.\nDAN:          DO tell me, I always struggle with revision.\nJEANNIE:       Well, the first thing is to find out exactly what’s required in the exams.\nDAN:          Mm. Would it help to get hold of some past papers?\nJEANNIE:       Yes. They’ll help to make it clear.\nDAN:          Right, I’ll do that. Then what?\nJEANNIE:       Then you can sort out your revision\npriorities (Q27)\n,\nbased on what’s most likely  to come up. I put these on a card, and read them through regularly.\nDAN:          Uhuh.\nJEANNIE:      But that isn’t enough in itself. You also need a\ntimetable (Q28)\n, to see how you can fit everything in, in the time available. Then keep it in front of you while you’re studying.\nDAN:          I’ve done that before, but it hasn’t helped me!\nJEANNIE:       Maybe you need to do something different every day, so if you “break down your revision into\nsmall tasks (Q29)\n, and allocate them to specific days, there’s more incentive to tackle them. With big topics you’re more likely to put off starting.\nDAN:          Good idea.\nJEANNIE:       And as I revise each topic I write a\nsingle paragraph (Q30)\nabout it- then later I can read it through quickly, and it helps fix things in my mind.\nDAN:          That’s brilliant.\nJEANNIE:       I also write answers to questions for the exam practice. It’s hard to make myself do it, though!\nDAN:          Well, I’ll try. Thanks a lot, Jeannie. That’s a great help.\nJEANNIE:       NO problem.\nDAN:          See you around.\nJEANNIE:       Bye.\n剑8 test 4 Section 3雅思听力答案\n21-22. BE\n23-24. AC\n25. B\n26. C\n27. priorities\n28. timetable\n29.

It’s fun, but\nwith all the rehearsing I\n’m doing, something has to go\n答案解析：离开辩论协会的原因是，排练太多，必须放弃一些东西。即时间不够，由此确定C为答案。\n第25题答案：B\n对应原文： it’s quite interesting, but\nI wonder if I\n’m clever enough\nto be doing this course.\n答案解析：录音中提到，男性怀疑自己是否足够聪明来参加研讨会，即他觉得自己可能比其他人差，由此确定B为答案。\n第26题答案：C\n对应原文：She gives me lots of feedback and advice,\nso I\n’ve got much better at writing essays. And she’s helping me plan my revision for the end-of-year exams\n答案解析：录音中女性提到她的导师给了许多反馈和建议，从而让她在论文写作上有所提升。而且她还帮助她制定复习计划。A和B都与原文叙述相差太远，只有C比较合适一些。\n第27题答案：priorities\n对应原文： Then you can sort out your revision\npriorities\n,\nbased on what’s most likely  to come up. I put these on a card, and read them through regularly.\n答案解析：根据then的提示，确定录音来到第27题。空前词your原词出现，而且revision在录音中提前，由此确定后面跟着的priorities就是答案。\n第28题答案：timetable\n对应原文：But that isn’t enough in itself. You also need a\ntimetable\n, to see how you can fit everything in, in the time available.\n答案解析：根据but的提示意识到录音进行到了第28题。空前词make在听力原文中并没有很好的对应，只能根据名词这一条件进行筛选，发现唯有timetable适合作为答案。\n第29题答案：(small) tasks\n对应原文：Maybe you need to do something different every day, so if you “break down your revision into\nsmall tasks\n答案解析：这道题可以通过问答节奏来定位，break，revision和into在录音中全都原词出现，很容易确定答案为small tasks。\n第30题答案：(single) paragraph\n对应原文：And as I revise each topic I write a\nsingle paragraph\nabout it\n答案解析：And提示答案即将到来，singe与题干中的one同义替换，由此确定答案为paragraph。"

I’ve been invited to talk about my research project into Australian Aboriginal rock paintings. The Australian Aborigines have recorded both real and symbolic images of their time on rock walls for many thousands of years. Throughout the long history of this tradition, new images have appeared and new painting styles have developed. And these characteristics can be used to categorise the different artistic styles. Among these are what we call the Dynamic, Yam and Modern styles of painting.\nOne of the most significant characteristics of the different styles is the way that humans are depicted in the paintings. The more recent paintings show people in static poses. But the first human images to dominate rock art paintings, over 8, 000 years ago, were full of movement. These paintings showed people hunting and cooking food and so they were given the name ‘Dynamic’ to reflect this energy. It’s quite amazing considering they were painted in such a simple stick-like form. In the Yam period, there was a movement away from stick figures to a more naturalistic shape. However, they didn’t go as far as the\nModern style, which is known as ‘x-ray’ because it actually makes a feature of the internal skeleton (Q31)\nas well as the organs of animals and humans.\nThe Yam style of painting got its name from the fact that it featured much curvier figures (Q32)\nthat actually resemble the vegetable called a yam, which is similar to a sweet potato.\nThe Modern paintings are interesting because they include paintings at the time of the first contact with European settlers. Aborigines managed to convey the idea of the settlers’ clothing by simply painting the Europeans without any hands (Q33)\n, indicating the habit of standing with their hands in their pockets! Size is another characteristic. The more recent images tend to be life size or even larger, but the\nDynamic figures are painted in miniature (Q34)\n.\nAboriginal rock art also records the environmental changes that occurred over thousands of years. For example, we know from the Dynamic paintings that over 8, 000 years ago, Aborigines would have rarely eaten fish and sea levels were much lower at this time. In fact,\nfish didn’t start to appear in paintings until the Yam period along with shells and other marine images (Q35)\n.\nThe paintings of the Yam tradition also suggest that, during this time, the Aborigines moved away from animals as their main food source and began including vegetables in their diet, as these feature prominently (36).\nFreshwater creatures didn’t appear in the paintings until the Modern period from 4, 000 years ago.\nSo, these paintings have already taught us a lot. But one image that has always intrigued us is known as the ‘Rainbow Serpent’. The Rainbow Serpent, which is the focus of my most recent project, gets its name from its snake or serpent-like body and it first appeared in the Yam period 4 to 6, 000 years ago. Many believe it is a curious mixture of kangaroo, snake and crocodile. But we decided to study the Rainbow Serpent paintings to see if we could locate the\nanimal (Q37)\nthat the very first painters based their image on.\nThe Yam period coincided with the end of the last ice age. This brought about tremendous change in the environment, with the\nsea levels rising (Q38)\n, and creeping steadily inland. This flooded many familiar land features and also caused a great deal of disruption to traditional patterns of life,\nhunting (Q39)\nin particular. New shores were formed and totally different creatures would have washed up onto the shores. We studied 107 paintings of the Rainbow Serpent and found that the one creature that matches it most closely was the Ribboned Pipefish, which is a type of sea horse. This sea creature would have been a totally unfamiliar sight in the inland regions where the image is found and may have been the inspiration behind the early paintings.\nSo, at the end of the ice age there would have been enormous changes in animal and plant life. It’s not surprising then, that the Aborigines linked this abundance to the new creatures they witnessed. Even today, Aborigines see the Rainbow Serpent as a symbol of\ncreation (Q40)\n, which is understandable given the increase in vegetation and the new life forms that featured when the image first appeared.\n剑8 test 4 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31.

Well, most of you probably know Sports World –\nthe\nbranch (Q11)\nof a Danish sports goods company\nthat opened a few years ago – it’s attracted a lot of custom, and so the company has now decided to open another branch in the area. It’s going to be in the shopping centre to the\nwest\n(Q12)\nof Bradcaster, so that will be good news for all of you who’ve found the original shop in the north of the town hard to get to.\nI was invited to a special preview and I can promise you, this is the ultimate in sports retailing. The whole place has been given a new minimalist look with the company’s signature colours of black and red. The first three floors have a huge range of sports\nclothing (Q13)\nas well as equipment, and on the top floor there’s a cafe and a book and DVD section. You’ll find all the well-known names as well as some less well- known ones. If they haven’t got exactly what you want in stock they promise to get it for you in\nten (Q14)\ndays. Unlike the other store, where it can take up to fourteen days. They cover all the major sports, including football, tennis and swimming, but they particularly focus on\nrunning (Q15)\n, and they claim to have the widest range of equipment in the country. As well as that, a whole section of the third floor is devoted to\nsports bags (Q16)\n, including the latest designs from the States – if you can’t find what you want here, it doesn’t exist!\nThe shop will be open from 9.00 am this Saturday and if you go along to the opening then you’ll have the chance to meet the national 400 metres running champion Paul King, who’s coming along to open the shop, and\nhe will be staying around until about midday (Q17)\nto chat to any fans who want to meet him and sign autographs.\nThen there will be a whole range of special attractions all weekend. There will be free tickets for local sporting events for the first 50 customers, and also a special competition open to all.

All entrants will receive a special Sports calendar with details of all Bradcaster fixtures in the coming year.\nOne of the special opening offers is a fitness test – a complete review of your cardiac fitness and muscle tone, actually done in the shop by qualified staff.\nThis would normally cost £30.00 but is available at half price for this month only (Q19).

Unlike the other store, where it can take up to fourteen days\n答案解析：一部分同学可能会将后面的14天当作答案，但那是其他商店的时间，而非sports world的。此外，雅思听力中，如果除了Section1以外的部分考察数字知识点，则绝大多数都会设置干扰项，大家看题的时候就要稍微注意一下。\n第15题答案：running\n对应原文： They cover all the major sports, including football, tennis and swimming, but they particularly focus on\nrunning\n答案解析：考察specialise与particularly的同义替换。答案本身不难，只要记着run的动名词要双写n就好。\n第16题答案：bags\n对应原文：As well as that, a whole section of the third floor is devoted to\nsports bags\n答案解析：这道题的难点主要在于bags的发音上。因为录音中读的十分短促、清脆，所以比较考察大家的听音辨音能力。\n第17题答案：A\n对应原文：Paul King, who’s coming along to open the shop, and\nhe will be staying around until about midday\nto chat to any fans who want to meet him and sign autographs.\n答案解析：录音中提到，冠军运动员只待到中午，因此确定A为答案。B选项在原文中并没有对应的地方。而C选项对应的是各种各样的活动，而非冠军运动员，因此统统排除。\n第18题答案：A\n对应原文：while\nthe first person to get all the questions correct gets a year’s free membership of the Bradcaster Gym\n答案解析：题干中问的是第一个答对所有题目的人会有什么奖品，因此确定A为答案。B选项中的物品只要答对15题就可以。而C选项的物品则是只要参与就可以得到。\n第19题答案：A\n对应原文：\nThere are only a limited number of places available for this, so to make a booking\nphone 560341\n答案解析：考察booking与reserve的同义替换。雅思听力选择题中，如果一个选项出现了预定（book, booking, reserve, reservation），那么这个选项有极大的概率就是正确答案。这也算是雅思听力中的一个蒙题小技巧。\n第20题答案：E\n对应原文：\nThis would normally cost £30.00 but is available at half price for this month only\n答案解析：录音中提到，这个月的体质检测只需要半价就可以，对应E选项中的cheaper，由此确定答案。"

I’d like to discuss with you the value of the English for Academic Purposes course you did here last year before starting your university course. Spiros, if I could start with you, what parts of the programme have now proved to be particularly valuable to you?\nSPIROS:\nI think that having to do a seminar presentation really helped me. For example, a couple of weeks ago in our marketing subject, when it was my turn to give a presentation I felt quite confident. Of course, I was still nervous but because I had done one before, I knew what to expect. Also, I know I was well-prepared and I had practised my timing. In fact, I think that in relation to some of the other people in my group, I did quite a good job because\nmy overall style was quite professional (Q21)\n. What about you, Hiroko?\nHIROKO:\nMmm, that’s interesting. In my group, I was really surprised by the way the students did their presentations – they just read their notes aloud! Can you believe that?\nThey didn’t worry about their presentation style or keeping eye contact with their audience (Q22)\n– and I remember that these things were really stressed to us in the course here.\nTEACHER:\nSo, how did you approach your presentation, Hiroko?\nHIROKO:\nWell, to speak frankly, I read my notes too! At the time, it was a relief to do it this way, but actually, when I had finished,\nI didn’t feel any real sense of satisfaction (Q23)\n. I didn’t feel positive about the experience at all.\nSPIROS:\nThat’s a pity. You know, although I was pleased with my presentation,\nI am not so pleased with my actual performance right now in the tutorials (Q24)\n– during the whole semester I’ve not said anything in our tutorial discussions. Not a word.\nHIROKO:\nReally, Spiros? Why’s that? Do the other students talk too much?\nSPIROS:\nIt’s partly that, but it’s mostly because I have had no confidence to speak out. Their style of speaking is so different – it’s not the style we were used to during the course. They use so many colloquialisms, they’re not very polite and sometimes there seems to be no order in their discussion. Also,\nthey are very familiar with each other, so because they know each other’s habits, they can let each other into the discussion (Q25)\n.\nHIROKO:\nYou’re right, Spiros, I’ve experienced that too.\nHIROKO:\nFor most of this semester, I’ve said absolutely nothing in tutorials. But recently,\nI’ve been trying to speak up more and I just jump in (Q26)\n, and I’ve noticed an interesting thing, I’ve noticed that if they thought my point was interesting or new, then the next time they actually asked for my opinion, and then it was much easier for me to be part of the discussion.\nSPIROS:\nThat’s great, Hiroko! I hope that happens for me next semester – I’ll have to work hard to find some interesting points. What helped you to find these ideas?\nHIROKO:\nI think that one thing that helped me with this was the reading. I’ve had to do so much reading this semester just to help me make sense of the lectures. At first, I couldn’t understand what the lecturers were talking about,\nso I had to turn to the books and journals (Q27)\n. Every night I read for hours, using the lists of references that were given, and I made pages of notes. At breakfast, I read and read my notes again. This habit has helped me to follow the ideas in the lectures, and it’s also given me some ideas to use in the tutorials.\nSPIROS:\nBut I did so much reading anyway – I don’t think there’s any time left over for anything extra.\nMy reading speed is still quite slow (Q28)\n, though I’m much better at dealing with vocabulary than I used to be.\nTEACHER:\nWhat else do you think we could add to the course program to help with this reading problem?\nSPIROS:\nThere’s not really anything because it’s my problem. I remember we were given long articles to read. We didn’t like that but now I realise that reading those long articles was good preparation for the things I need to read now. Also, in class, we regularly had speed-reading tasks to do, and we kept a record of our reading speed, so the teachers were encouraging us to work on that.\nHIROKO:\nThat’s true Spiros, but what we read could have been different. Sometimes in the English class, I felt frustrated when I had to read articles about the environment or health or education, because\nI wanted to concentrate on my own field but we didn’t read anything about engineering (Q29)\n. So, I think I wasted some time learning vocabulary I didn’t need.\nTEACHER:\nBut surely the strategies you were taught for dealing with that vocabulary were helpful.\nHIROKO:\nYes, but psychologically speaking,\nI would have felt much better working on reading from my own field (Q30)\n. What do you think Spiros?\nSPIROS:\nI agree; that would have helped my confidence too and I would have been more motivated. It was good though that we could work on our own topics when we wrote the research assignments.\nTEACHER:\nOkay, let’s move on to writing now …\n剑9 test 1 Section 3雅思听力答案\n21. B\n22. C\n23. B\n24.

Well, with some of you about to go out on field work it’s timely that in this afternoon’s session I’ll be sharing some ideas about the reasons why groups of whales and dolphins sometimes swim ashore from the sea right onto the beach and, most often, die in what are known as ‘mass strandings’.\nUnfortunately, this type of event is a frequent occurrence in some of the locations that you’ll be travelling to, where sometimes the\ntide (Q31)\ngoes out suddenly, confusing the animals. However, there are many other theories about the causes of mass strandings.\nThe first is that the behaviour is linked to parasites. It’s often found that stranded animals were infested with large numbers of parasites. For instance, a type of worm is commonly found in the\nears (Q32)\nof dead whales. Since marine animals rely heavily on their hearing to navigate, this type of infestation has the potential to be very harmful\n.\nAnother theory is related to toxins, or poisons. These have also been found to contribute to the death of many marine animals. Many toxins, as I’m sure you’re aware, originate from plants, or\nanimals (Q33).\nThe whale ingests these toxins in its normal feeding behaviour but whether these poisons directly or indirectly lead to stranding and death, seems to depend upon the toxin involved.\nIn 1988, for example, fourteen humpback whales examined after stranding along the beaches of Cape Cod were found to have been poisoned after eating tuna that contained saxitoxin, the same toxin that can be fatal in humans.\nAlternatively, it has also been suggested that some animals strand accidentally by following their prey ashore in the confusion of the chase. In 1995 David Thurston monitored pilot whales that beached after following squid ashore. However, this idea does not seem to hold true for the majority of mass strandings because examination of the animals’ stomach contents reveal that most had not been\nfeeding (Q34)\nas they stranded\n.\nThere are also some new theories which link strandings to humans. A growing concern is that\nloud\nnoises (Q35)\nin the ocean cause strandings. Noises such as those caused by military exercises are of particular concern and have been pinpointed as the cause of some strandings of late.\nOne of these, a mass stranding of whales in 2000 in the Bahamas coincided closely with experiments using a new submarine detection system. There were several factors that made this stranding stand out as different from previous strandings. This led researchers to look for a new cause. For one, all the stranded animals were\nhealthy (Q36)\n. In addition, the animals were spread out along 38 kilometres of coast, whereas it’s more common for the animals to be found in a\ngroup (Q37)\nwhen mass strandings occur.\nA final theory is related to group behaviour, and suggests that sea mammals cannot distinguish between sick and healthy leaders and will follow sick leaders, even to an inevitable death. This is a particularly interesting theory since the whales that are thought to be most\nsocial (Q38)\n– the toothed whales – are the group that strand the most frequently.\nThe theory is also supported by evidence from a dolphin stranding in 1994. Examination of the dead animals revealed that apart from the\nleader (Q39)\n, all the others had been healthy at the time of their death.\nWithout one consistent theory, however, it is very hard for us to do anything about this phenomenon except to assist animals where and when we can. Stranding networks have been established around the world to aid in rescuing animals and collecting samples from those that could not be helped. I recommend John Connor’s\nMarine Mammals Ashore\nas an excellent starting point if you’re interested in finding out more about these\nnetworks (Q40)\n, or establishing one yourself.\n剑9 test 1 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31. tide/tides\n32. hearing/ear/ears\n33. plants animals/fish/fishes\n34. feeding\n35. noise/noises\n36. healthy\n37. group\n38. social\n39. leader\n40. network/networks"

Since marine animals rely heavily on their hearing to navigate\n答案解析：这道题的两个答案分别对应题干中的两组修饰关系。如果我们将重点文章来自老烤鸭雅思放在空前的所有格上，那么就会找到of结构，进而确定ears为答案。如果我们将重点放在定语从句中的depend on上，就会找到rely on这一组同义替换，由此锁定hearing为答案。\n第33题答案：plants animals/fish/fishes\n对应原文：Many toxins, as I’m sure you’re aware, originate from plants, or\nanimals\n答案解析：这道题比较简单一些。听到toxins意识到答案即将到来。从题干可以推测空上应该填一组并列的单词，由此锁定plants和animals。\n第34题答案：feeding\n对应原文：this idea does not seem to hold true for the majority of mass strandings because examination of the animals’ stomach contents reveal that most had not been\nfeeding\nas they stranded\n答案解析：听到majority意识到答案即将到来，空前有个not的否定，根据这一点可以锁定feeding。\n第35题答案：noise/noises\n对应原文： There are also some new theories which link strandings to humans. A growing concern is that loud\nnoises\nin the ocean cause strandings.\n答案解析：雅思听力中，如果空设置在句首，那么我们可以根据上一行结尾或者小标题来定位，进而提示自己答案即将到来。比如这道题我们就可以利用humans。\n第36题答案：healthy\n对应原文： For one, all the stranded animals were\nhealthy\n答案解析：听到all意识到答案即将到来。从题干中可以推测空上应该填一个形容词，再加上healthy明显重读，很容易确定为答案。\n第37题答案：group\n对应原文：In addition, the animals were spread out along 38 kilometres of coast, whereas it’s more common for the animals to be found in a\ngroup\nwhen mass strandings occur.\n答案解析：虽然题干中的否定在录音中没有出现，但空前介词in保持不变，由此帮助我们确定group为答案。\n第38题答案：social\n对应原文：This is a particularly interesting theory since the whales that are thought to be most\nsocial\n答案解析：虽然小标题group behaviour离答案较远，但空前词most原词出现，提示我们social就是答案。\n第39题答案：leader\n对应原文：Examination of the dead animals revealed that apart from the\nleader\n, all the others had been healthy at the time of their death.\n答案解析：这道题的同义替换比较精巧，将题干中的only … ill替换为apart from … healthy。不过哪怕我们在听的时候反应不过来，也可以根据重读注意到leader，进而通过句子意思判断它是答案。\n第40题答案：network/networks\n对应原文：Stranding networks have been established around the world\nI recommend John Connor’s\nMarine Mammals Ashore\nas an excellent starting point if you’re interested in finding out more about these\nnetworks\n答案解析：这道题的答案出现了两次，正好对应雅思听力中两种确定答案的方法。其一是修饰关系，根据空前词stranding确定答案为networks；其二为词性和句义，根据Marine Mammals Ashore先缩小范围，然后根据名词锁定networks，最后根据句义流畅判断它就是答案。"

It’s a good way to socialise.\n答案解析：shared的/d/读的比较弱，很容易忽略导致写成了share。这点可以通过词性辅助判断一下。"

I think you’ll be surprised at the variety we have here, even though we’re not far from London. I’ll start by telling you about some of the parks and open spaces nearby.\nOne very pleasant place is Halland Common. This has been public land for hundreds of years, and what you’ll find interesting is that the River Ouse, which flows into the sea eighty kilometres away, has its source in the common. There’s an information board about the plants and animals you can see here, and by the way, the common is accessible 24 hours a day.\nThen there’s Holt Island, which is noted for its great range of\ntrees (Q11)\n. In the past willows were grown here commercially for basket-making, and this ancient craft has recently been reintroduced. The island is only open to the public\nfrom Friday to Sunday (Q12)\n, because it’s quite small, and if there were people around every day, much of the wildlife would keep away.\nFrom there it’s just a short walk across the bridge to Longfield Country Park. Longfield has a modern replica of a\nfarm\n(Q13)\nfrom over two thousand years ago. Children’s activities are often arranged there, like bread-making and face-painting. The park is only open during daylight hours, so bear that in mind if you decide to go there.\nLongfield Park has a programme of activities throughout the year, and to give you a sample, this is what’s happening in the next few days. On Monday you can learn about herbs, and how they’ve been used over the centuries. You’ll start with a tour of our herb garden,\npractise the technique of using them as colour dyes for cloth (Q14)\n, and listen to an illustrated talk about their use in cooking and medicine.\nThen on Wednesday, you can join local experts to discover the variety of insects and birds that appear in the evening. We keep to a small number of people in the group,\nso if you want to go you’ll need to phone the park ranger a few days ahead (Q15)\n. There’s a small charge, which you should pay when you turn up.\nI’m sure you’re all keen to help with the practical task of looking after the park, so on Saturday, you can join a working party. You’ll have a choice of all sorts of activities, from planting hedges to picking up litter, so you’ll be able to change from one to another when you feel like it. The rangers will be hard at work all day, but do come and join in, even for just a short while. One thing, though, is to\nmake sure you’re wearing something that you don’t mind getting dirty or torn (Q16)\n.\nAnd finally, I’d like to tell you about our new wildlife area, Hinchingbrooke Park, which will be opened to the public next month. This slide doesn’t really indicate how big it is, but anyway, you can see the two gates into the park, and the main paths. As you can see, there’s a lake in the north-west of the park, with\na bird hide to the west of it, at the end of a path (Q17)\n. So it’ll be a nice quiet place for watching the birds on the lake.\nFairly close to where refreshments are available,\nthere’s a dog-walking area in the\nsouthern part of the park (Q18)\n, leading off from the path. And if you just want to sit and relax, you can go to\nthe flower garden; that’s the circular area on the map surrounded by paths (Q19)\n.\nAnd finally, there’s\na wooded area in the western section of the park between two paths (Q20)\n.\nOkay, that’s enough from me, so let’s go on to …\n剑9 test 2 Section 2雅思听力答案\n11. trees\n12.

As you know, I’ve asked you here today to discuss the future of our Self-Access Centre. We have to decide what we want to do about this very important resource for our English language students. So, can you tell me what the students think about this?\nJUN:\nWell, from the students’ point of view, we would like to keep it. The majority of students say that they enjoy using it because it provides a variation on the classroom routine and\nthey see it as a pretty major component of their course (Q21)\n, but we would like to see some improvements to the equipment, particularly the computers; there aren’t enough for one each at the moment and we always have to share.\nPAM:\nWell yes, the teachers agree that it is a very valuable resource but one thing we have noticed is that a lot of the students are using it to check their personal emails. We don’t want to stop you students using it, but we think the computers should be used as a learning resource, not for emails.\nSome of us also think that we could benefit a lot more by relocating the Self-Access Centre to the main University library building (Q22)\n. How do you think the students would feel about that, Jun?\nJUN:\nWell, the library is big enough to incorporate the Self-Access Centre, but it wouldn’t be like a class activity anymore.\nOur main worry would be not being able to go to a teacher for advice (Q23)\n. I’m sure there would be plenty of things to do but we really need teachers to help us choose the best activities.\nPAM:\nWell, there would still be a teacher present and he or she would guide the activities of the students, we wouldn’t just leave them to get on with it.\nJUN:\nYes, but I think the students would be much happier keeping the existing set-up; they really like going to the Self-Access Centre with their teacher and staying together as a group to do activities. If we could just improve the resources and facilities, I think it would be fine. Is the cost going to be a problem?\nPAM:\nIt’s not so much the expense that I’m worried about, and we’ve certainly got room to do it, but\nit’s the problem of timetabling a teacher to be in\nthere outside class hours (Q24)\n. If we’re going to spend a lot of money on equipment and resources, we really need to make sure that everything is looked after properly. Anyway, let’s make some notes to see just what needs doing to improve the Centre.\nPAM:\nNow, what about the computers? I think it might be a good idea to install some new models. They would take up a lot less room and so that would increase the workspace for textbooks and so on.\nJUN:\nThat would be great. It is a bit cramped in there at times.\nPAM:\nWhat about other resources? Do you have a list of things that the students would like to see improved?\nJUN:\nYes, one of the comments that students frequently make is that they find it difficult to find materials that are appropriate for their level, especially\nreading\n(Q25)\nresources, so I think we need to label them more clearly.\nPAM:\nWell that’s easy enough, we can get that organised very quickly. In fact, I think we should review all of the study resources as some of them are looking a bit out-of-date.\nJUN:\nDefinitely. The\nCD (Q26)\nsection especially needs to be more current. I think we should get some of the ones that go with our latest course books and also make multiple copies.\nPAM:\nGood, now I was also thinking about some different materials that we haven’t got in there at all. What do you think of the idea of introducing some\nworkbooks (Q27)\n? If we break them up into separate pages and laminate them, they’d be a great resource. The students could study the main coursebook in class and then do follow-up practice in the Self-Access Centre.\nJUN:\nThat sounds good.\nPAM:\nOkay, now finally we need to think about how the room is used. I’ll have to talk to the teachers and make sure we can all reach some agreement on a\ntimetable (Q28)\nto supervise the centre after class. But we also need to think about security, too. Especially if we’re going to invest in some new equipment.\nJUN:\nWhat about putting in an\nalarm (Q29)\n?\nPAM:\nGood idea. The other thing I’d like to do is talk to our technicians and see whether we could somehow limit the access to\nemail (Q30)\n. I really don’t want to see that resource misused.\nJUN:\nWhat about if we agree to only use it before and after class?\nRAM:\nYes, that would be fine. OK, anyway … that’s great for now. We’ll discuss it further when we’ve managed to …\n剑9 test 2 Section 3雅思听力答案\n21. C\n22. B\n23. B\n24. C\n25. reading\n26. CD\n27. workbooks\n28. timetable/schedule\n29. alarm\n30. email(s)"

Now whether you’re going to university to study business or some other subject, many of you will eventually end up working for a company of some kind.\nNow, when you first start working somewhere you will realise that the organisation you’ve joined has certain characteristics. And we often refer to these social characteristics as the culture of the organisation – this includes its unwritten ideas, beliefs, values and things like that. One well-known writer has classified company cultures by identifying four major types.\nThe first type is called the Power Culture, and it’s usually found in small organisations.\nIt’s the type of culture that needs a\ncentral\n(Q31)\nsource of power to be effective, and because control is in the hands of just one or two people there aren’t many rules or procedures. Another characteristic is that communication usually takes the form of\nconversations\n(Q32)\nrather than, say, formal meetings or written memos. Now one of the benefits of this culture is that the organisation has the ability to act quickly, so it responds well to threat, or danger on the one hand, and opportunity on the other.\nBut on the negative side, this type of organisation doesn’t always act\neffectively (Q33)\n, because it depends too much on one or two people at the top, and when these people make poor decisions there’s no-one else who can influence them.\nAnd the kind of person who does well in this type of business culture is one who is happy to take\nrisks\n(Q34)\n, and for whom job security is a low priority.\nThe next type is known as Role Culture – that’s R-O-L-E, not R-O-double L, by the way, and this type is usually found in large companies, which have lots of different\nlevels (Q35)\nin them. These organisations usually have separate departments that specialise in things like finance, or sales, or maintenance, or whatever. Each one is co-ordinated at the top by a small group of senior managers, and typically everyone’s job is controlled by sets of rules and procedures – for example, there are specific job\ndescriptions (Q36)\n, rules for discipline, and so on.\nWhat are the benefits of this kind of culture? Well firstly, because it’s found in large organisations, its fixed costs, or overheads as they’re known, are low in relation to its output, or what it produces. In other words it can achieve economies of scale. And secondly, it is particularly successful in business markets where\ntechnical (Q37)\nexpertise is important. On the other hand, this culture is often very slow to recognise the need for\nchange (Q38)\n, and even slower to react. What kind of person does this type of culture suit? Well it suits employees who value security, and who don’t particularly want to have\nresponsibility (Q39)\n.\nMoving on now to Task Cultures – this type is found in organisations that are project-oriented. You usually find it where the market for the company’s product is extremely competitive, or where the products themselves have a short life-span. Usually top management delegates the projects, the people and other resources. And once these have been allocated, little day-to-day control is exercised from the top, because this would seem like ‘breaking the rules’.\nNow one of the major benefits of this culture is that it’s\nflexible (Q40)\n. But it does have some major disadvantages too. For instance, it can’t produce economies of scale or great depth of expertise. People who like working in groups or teams prefer this type of culture.\nAnd finally, the fourth category is called the Person Culture …\n剑9 test 2 Section 4雅思听力答案\n31. central\n32. conversation/conversations\n33. effectively\n34. risk/risks\n35. levels\n36. description/descriptions\n37. technical\n38. change\n39. responsibility\n40. flexible"

I have a friend who’s just come back from Corfu and she’s recommended some apartments in Arilas. She thought they might be on your list.\nMAN:\nArilas, Arilas, let me see. Can you give me the names?\nWOMAN:\nYes, the first’s Rose Garden Apartments. I’d like to go with another friend in the last week of October.\nMAN:\nWell, we’ve got a lovely studio flat available at that time. I’m sure you’d enjoy the entertainment programme there too, with\nGreek dancing (Example)\nin the restaurant.\nWOMAN:\nAnd the cost for each of us?\nMAN:\n£219.\nWOMAN:\nThat sounds very reasonable! I’m just jotting down some notes. Now the second one she mentioned was called Blue Bay.\nMAN:\nBlue Bay? Yes, in fact that’s very popular and it has some special features.\nWOMAN:\nReally?\nMAN:\nThe main attraction is the large swimming pool with salt water.\nWOMAN:\nMuch healthier, I understand.\nMAN:\nThat’s right. And it isn’t far from the beach, either- only\n300 metres (Q1)\n, and only around half a kilometre to some shops, so you don’t have to be too energetic.\nWOMAN:\nIs it much more expensive than the first one?\nMAN:\nLet me just check. I think at the time you want to go it’s around £260 – no £275 to be exact.\nWOMAN:\nRight, I’ve got that. Now there are just two more apartments to ask you about. Um, I can’t read my own writing! Something to do with sun … Sunshine, is it?\nMAN:\nI think you meant the\nSunshade (Q2)\nApartments. They’re on a mountainside.\nWOMAN:\nAny special features?\nMAN:\nYes, each room has its own sun terrace and there are shared barbecue facilities.\nWOMAN:\nSounds lovely!\nMAN:\nYes, it is rather well-equipped. It also provides water sports – it has its own beach. There are facilities for water-skiing.\nWOMAN:\nAny kite-surfing? My friend’s quite keen.\nMAN:\nNot at the hotel but I’m sure you’ll find some in Arilas. There’s also satellite TV in the apartments.\nWOMAN:\nAnd how much is that one?\nMAN:\n£490 with two sharing.\nWOMAN:\nYou mean £245 each?\nMAN:\nI’m afraid not! Each person has to pay that amount and there must be at least two in an apartment.\nWOMAN:\nI don’t think that would be within our budget, unfortunately. And the last one sounds a bit expensive too – the Grand!\nMAN:\nActually it’s quite reasonable. It’s an older style house with Greek paintings in every room, and a\nbalcony (Q3)\noutside.\nWOMAN:\nSounds nice. What are the views like?\nMAN:\nWell, there are\nforests (Q4)\nall round and they hide a supermarket just down the road, so that’s very useful for all your shopping needs. There’s a disco in the area too.\nWOMAN:\nAnd the price?\nMAN:\n£319 (Q5)\nat that time, but if you leave it till November it goes down by 40%.\nWOMAN:\nToo late, I’m afraid.\nMAN:\nWell, why don’t I send you a brochure with full details, Ms … ?\nWOMAN:\nNash. But don’t worry about that. I’m coming to Upminster soon and I’ll call and get one. I just wanted to get an idea first.\nMAN:\nWell, that’s fine. We’ve got plenty here when you come.\nWOMAN:\nIf you’ve got a minute, could I just check a couple of points about insurance? I got one policy through the post but I’d like to see if yours is better.\nMAN:\nFine. What would you like to know?\nWOMAN:\nWell, the one I’ve got has benefits and then the maximum amount you can claim. Is that like yours?\nMAN:\nYes, that’s how most of them are.\nWOMAN:\nWell, the first thing is cancellation. If the holiday’s cancelled on the policy I’ve got, you can claim £8,000.\nMAN:\nWe can improve on that, Ms Nash. For Greek Island holidays, our maximum is\n£10,000 (Q6)\n.\nWOMAN:\nThat’s good – of course our holiday won’t even cost £1,000 together!\nMAN:\nIt’s still sensible to have good cover. Now, if you go to hospital, we allow £600.\nWOMAN:\nYes, mine’s similar.\nMAN:\nAnd we also allow a\nrelative\n(Q7)\nto travel to your holiday resort.\nWOMAN:\nMy policy just says their representative will help you.\nMAN:\nYou can see there’s another difference there. And what happens if you don’t get on the plane?\nWOMAN:\nNothing, as far as I can see on this form.\nMAN:\nDon’t you have\nmissed (Q8)\ndeparture?\nWOMAN:\nNo, I’ll just jot that down.\nMAN:\nWe pay up to £1,000 for that, depending on the reason. And we’re particularly generous about loss of personal belongings – up to £3,000, but not more than £500 for a single\nitem\n(Q9)\n.\nWOMAN:\nThen I’d better not take my laptop!\nMAN:\nNot unless you insure it separately.\nWOMAN:\nOK – thanks very much for your time – you’ve really been helpful. Can I get back to you? Your name is?\nMAN:\nBen –\nLudlow. That’s L-U-D-L-O-W (Q10)\n. I’m the Assistant Manager here. I’ll give you my number. It’s 081260 543216.\nWOMAN:\nBut didn’t I phone 081260 567294? That’s what I’ve got on the paper.\nMAN:\nThat’s the main switchboard. I’ve given you my direct line.\nWOMAN:\nRight, thank you …\n剑9 test 3 Section 1雅思听力答案\n1. 300\n2. Sunshade\n3. balcony\n4. forest/forests\n5. 319\n6. 10,000\n7. relative\n8. missed\n9. item\n10.

And it isn’t far from the beach, either- only\n300 metres\n答案解析：从题干上可以很轻易的推断出空上应该填一个数字，300这一答案听起来也不算复杂。唯一的难点在于答案距离例子很远，比较考验耐心。\n第2题答案：Sunshade\n对应原文：I think you meant the\nSunshade\nApartments. They’re on a mountainside.\n答案解析：这道题的难点在于单词拼写。因为不少同学都不认识sunshade，哪怕知道上面说的sunshine不对，也只能先写上去凑合一下。\n第3题答案：balcony\n对应原文：Actually it’s quite reasonable. It’s an older style house with Greek paintings in every room, and a\nbalcony\noutside.\n答案解析：虽然距离上一道题目较远，但有The Grand帮助我们定位，并不是很难找到答案文章来自老烤鸭雅思所在的句子。balcony是雅思听力Section1超级经常考察的单词，大家务必要掌握拼写。\n第4题答案：forest/forests\n对应原文：Well, there are\nforests\nall round and they hide a supermarket just down the road\n答案解析：单词本身不难。但一方面答案离上一道题太近，很容易反应不过来；另一方面，forests读的又轻又快，给识别造成了一定的困难。\n第5题答案：319\n对应原文：\n£319\nat that time, but if you leave it till November it goes down by 40%.\n答案解析：考察十几和几十的区分。此外需要注意的是，雅思听力中并不会考察计算，哪怕涉及到折扣或者涨价，也会在后面把变动之后的数字直接说出来。大家听到加减乘除不用惊慌。\n第6题答案：10,000\n对应原文：We can improve on that, Ms Nash. For Greek Island holidays, our maximum is\n£10,000\n答案解析：考察限定条件。前面先说了8000这一数字，但并不符合表头maximum amount的限定，因此排除。\n第7题答案：relative\n对应原文：And we also allow a\nrelative\nto travel to your holiday resort.\n答案解析：relative在这里表示亲戚的意思，定位方面并没有什么困难。\n第8题答案：missed\n对应原文：Don’t you have\nmissed\ndeparture\n答案解析：这道题的难点主要在于语音现象。missed的尾音与departure的首音相同，出现吞音。导致我们听到的只是miss，需要根据题干语法，自己把ed补上。\n第9题答案：item\n对应原文：And we’re particularly generous about loss of personal belongings – up to £3,000, but not more than £500 for a single\nitem\n答案解析：难点同样在于语音现象。single的尾音和item的首音出现连读，导致听起来像是litem，给单词辨别造成一定的困难。\n第10题答案：Ludlow\n对应原文：\nLudlow. That’s L-U-D-L-O-W\n答案解析：考察姓名拼写，属于送分题。"

Welcome, Simon. Now, perhaps you can begin by telling us a little bit about how it all started.\nMAN\n: Well, during the 1970s, my wife, Liz and I had just acquired 80 acres of sheep-farming land, and we decided to settle down and have children. Pretty soon we had a daughter, Sarah, and a son, Duncan. The place was wonderful for the kids: they particularly loved trains and gradually built up an enormous network of miniature railway track.  I began to develop larger-scale models of locomotives but we didn’t think anything more of it until\nI went on a trip to a theme park near Birmingham and decided we could do a much better job (Q11)!\nSo we set up a small one ourselves based on the miniature railway and\nwe opened to the public for just a month that year, 1984 – in July – our driest month – because our children said they didn’t want our guests to have a miserable wet visit (Q12).\nI dealt with Park business and Liz carried on with the farm work.\nIt soon became clear that we were onto a winner. We began to extend the railway track and lay it among more interesting landscape by planting trees, which in turn attracted more wildlife, and by making cuttings through the rock.\nNowadays, we’re open all year round and we’re pleased to say that Winridge is one of the most popular visitor attractions in the area – with 50,000 visitors a year-\na million and a half people have been through our doors since we opened (Q13)\n.\nAll these visitors mean we have had to expand our operation and it’s now a truly family concern. I’m near to retirement age so\nI only concern myself with looking after the mechanical side of things (Q14)\n– keeping the trains going.\nLiz now devotes all her energies to recruiting and supporting the large squadron of workers (Q15)\nwhich keep the place running smoothly. We’re really pleased that after some years away teaching,\nSarah has now returned to the park and makes sure the visitors are kept fed and watered (Q16)\n,\nwhich keeps her pretty busy as you can imagine. Our son,\nDuncan, has been a stalwart of the park for the last ten years, taking over from me in the area of construction (Q17)\n– and I’ll say a little bit more about that in a moment – and\nhis new wife, Judith, has also joined the team in charge of retail (Q18).\nThat’s becoming a tremendous growth area for us – a lot of people want to buy souvenirs.\nWOMAN\n: So have you finished your development of the site for the moment?\nMAN\n: Not at all! We’re constantly looking for ways to offer more to our visitors.\nThe railway remains the central feature and there’s now 1.2 kilometres of the line laid but we’d like to lay more. Because of the geology of the area, our greatest problem is digging tunnels. But we’re gradually overcoming that. We’re also very pleased with a new installation of the Go-Kart arena which is\n120 (Q19)\nsquare metres in area. Again the problem is the geology; we had to level the mounds on the track for safety reasons. We wanted to enable\n5-12 (Q20)\nyear olds to use the go-karts. And the main attraction here is the Formula 1 Kart. We’ve known fights to break out over who gets it! And then finally to our most recent development which is the landscaped …\n剑9 test 3 Section 2雅思听力答案\n11. C\n12. A\n13. C\n14. E\n15. H\n16. F\n17. C\n18. G\n19. 120\n20. 5 to 12"

Sit down.\nCAROLINE:\nThanks.\nTUTOR:\nSo how’s the dissertation planning going?\nCAROLINE:\nWell Dr Schulmann, I’m still having a lot of trouble deciding on a title.\nTUTOR:\nWell, that’s perfectly normal at this stage. And this is what your tutorials will help you to do.\nCAROLINE:\nRight.\nTUTOR:\nWhat we’ll do is jot down some points that might help you in your decision. First of all, you have chosen your general topic area, haven’t you?\nCAROLINE:\nYes, it’s the\nfishing industry (Q21)\n.\nTUTOR:\nOh yes, that was one of the areas you mentioned. Now, what aspects of the course are you good at?\nCAROLINE:\nWell, I think I’m coping well with\nstatistics (Q22)\n, and I’m never bored by it.\nTUTOR:\nGood. Anything else?\nCAROLINE:\nWell, I found computer modelling fascinating – I have no problem following what’s being taught, whereas quite a few of my classmates find it difficult.\nTUTOR:\nWell, that’s very good. Do you think these might be areas you could bring into your dissertation?\nCAROLINE:\nOh yes, if possible. It’s just that I’m having difficulty thinking how I can do that. You see I feel I don’t have sufficient background information.\nTUTOR:\nI see. Well, do you take notes?\nCAROLINE:\nI’m very weak at\nnote-taking (Q23)\n. My teachers always used to say that.\nTUTOR:\nWell, I think you really need to work on these weaknesses before you go any further.\nCAROLINE:\nWhat do you suggest?\nTUTOR:\nWell, I can go through the possible strategies with you and let you decide where to go from there.\nCAROLINE:\nOkay, thanks.\nTUTOR:\nWell, some people find it helpful to organise peer-group discussions – you know, each week a different person studies a different topic and shares it with the group.\nCAROLINE:\nOh right.\nTUTOR:\nIt really helps build\nconfidence (Q24)\n, you know, having to present something to others.\nCAROLINE:\nI can see that.\nTUTOR:\nThe drawback is that everyone in the group seems to share the same\nideas (Q25)\n… they keep being repeated in all the dissertations.\nCAROLINE:\nOkay.\nTUTOR:\nYou could also try a service called ‘\nStudent Support\n‘\n(Q26)\n. It’s designed to give you a structured programme over a number of weeks to develop your skills.\nCAROLINE:\nSounds good.\nTUTOR:\nYes, unfortunately, there are only a few\nplaces (Q27)\n. But it’s worth looking into.\nCAROLINE:\nYes, of course. I know I’ve got to work on my study skills.\nTUTOR:\nAnd then there are several study skills books you can consult.\nCAROLINE:\nRight.\nTUTOR:\nThey’ll be a good source of reference but the problem is they are sometimes too\ngeneral (Q28)\n.\nCAROLINE:\nYes, that’s what I’ve found.\nTUTOR:\nOther than that I would strongly advise quite simple ideas like using a card index.\nCAROLINE:\nWell, yes, I’ve never done that before.\nTUTOR:\nIt’s simple, but it really works because you have to get points down in a small space. Another thing I always advise is don’t just take your notes and forget about them. Read everything\nthree times (29)\n– that’ll really fix them in your mind.\nCAROLINE:\nYes, I can see it’d take discipline but …\nTUTOR:\nWell, if you establish good study skills at this stage they’ll be with you all your life.\nCAROLINE:\nOh yes, I completely agree. It’s just that I don’t seem to be able to discipline myself. I need to talk things over.\nTUTOR:\nWell, we’ll be continuing these tutorials of course. Let’s arrange next month’s now.

First of all, you have chosen your general topic area, haven’t you?\nCAROLINE:\nYes, it’s the\nfishing industry\n答案解析：这道题采用了Section3比较常见的问答手法。由提问者，也就是老师说出提示词topic，然后再由回答者，也就是学生说出答案。fishing这里是捕鱼，打鱼的意思。fishing industry可以翻译为渔业。\n第22题答案：statistics\n对应原文： Well, I think I’m coping well with\nstatistics\n, and I’m never bored by it.\n答案解析：无论是老师提问中的good at还是学生回答中的coping well都可以文章来自老烤鸭雅思与题干上的strengths同义替换。statistics（统计，统计学）是听力Section3和Section4的超级常考词，大家务必要掌握。\n第23题答案：note-taking\n对应原文：\nTUTOR:\nI see. Well, do you take notes?\nCAROLINE:\nI’m very weak at\nnote-taking\n. My teachers always used to say that.\n答案解析：这道题要找到大体位置并不难。但部分同学可能会误以为take notes是答案。虽然它跟后面的note-taking十分相似，但词性却相差太远。填上去之后语法不对，因此排除，继续往下听。\n第24题答案：confidence\n对应原文： It really helps build\nconfidence\n, you know, having to present something to others.\n答案解析：听到peer group discussion意识到答案即将到来。build跟increase同义替换，由此确定答案为confidence。\n第25题答案：ideas\n对应原文：The drawback is that everyone in the group seems to share the same\nideas\n答案解析：drawback与表头problem同义替换，提示答案即将到来。空前词same原词出现，很容易确定答案为ideas。\n第26题答案：student support\n对应原文： You could also try a service called ‘\nStudent Support\n‘. It’s designed to give you a structured programme over a number of weeks to develop your skills.\n答案解析：雅思听力中called后面经常会接答案出现，而且student support也算是介绍学校所提供的服务时经常考到的单词，在剑桥雅思5 Test3 Section3就曾出现过，大家可以留意一下。\n第27题答案：places\n对应原文：Yes, unfortunately, there are only a few\nplaces\n. But it’s worth looking into.\n答案解析：用unfortunately替换problems提示答案即将出现。limited与a few同义替换，由此确定答案为places。\n第28题答案：general\n对应原文：They’ll be a good source of reference but the problem is they are sometimes too\ngeneral\n答案解析：这道题基本算得上是送分题，表头problem和空前词too全都原词出现，由此可以很轻易确定答案为general。\n第29题答案：3 times\n对应原文： Another thing I always advise is don’t just take your notes and forget about them. Read everything\nthree times\n答案解析：这道题唯一的难点可能在于跟上一题答案相距太远，只要保持足够的耐心就好。\n第30题答案：25\n对应原文：Fine, we’ll go for the\n25th\nthen.\n答案解析：雅思听力Section3很少考察日期这个知识点，但只要考察就几乎一定会出现干扰项。大家注意一下即可。"

In the last few lectures I’ve been talking about the history of domestic building construction. But today I want to begin looking at some contemporary, experimental designs for housing. So, I’m going to start with a house which is constructed more or less under the ground. And one of the interesting things about this project is that the owners – both professionals but not architects – wanted to be closely involved, so they decided to manage the project themselves.\nTheir chief aim was to create somewhere that was as environmentally-friendly as possible (Q31)\n. But at the same time they wanted to live somewhere peaceful – they’d both grown up in a rural area and disliked urban life.\nSo the first thing they did was to look for a site. And they found a disused stone quarry in a beautiful area.\nThe price was relatively low (Q32)\n, and they liked the idea of recycling the land, as it were. As it was, the quarry was an ugly blot on the landscape, and it wasn’t productive any longer, either.\nThey consulted various architects and looked at a number of designs before finally deciding on one. As I’ve said, it was a design for a sort of underground house, and it was built into the earth itself, with two storeys. The north, east and west sides were set in the earth, and only the sloping, south-facing side was exposed to light. That was made of a double layer of very strong\nglass (Q33)\n. There were also photovoltaic tiles fixed to the top and bottom of this sloping wall. These are tiles that are designed to store energy from the sun. And the walls had a layer of foam around them too, to increase the\ninsulation (Q34)\n.\nNow, what is of interest to us about this project is the features which make the building energy-efficient. Sunlight floods in through the glass wall, and to maximise it there are lots of mirrors and\nwindows (Q35)\ninside the house. That helps to spread the light around. So that’s the first thing – light is utilised as fully as possible.\nIn addition, the special tiles on the outside convert energy from the sun and generate some of the house’s electricity. In fact,  and it’s possible that in future the house may even generate an\nelectricity (Q36)\nsurplus, and that the owners will be able to sell some to the national grid.\nAs well as that, wherever possible, recycled materials have been used. For example, the floors\n(Q37)\nare made of reclaimed wood. And the owners haven’t bought a single item of new furniture – they just kept what they already had. And then there’s the system for dealing with the\nwaste (Q38)\nproduced in the house. This is dealt with organically – it’s purified by being filtered through reed beds which have been planted for that purpose in the garden. So the occupants of the house won’t pollute the land or use any damaging chemicals.\nIt’s true that the actual construction of the house was harmful to the environment mainly because they had to use massive amounts of\nconcrete (Q39)\n– one of the biggest sources of carbon dioxide in manufacturing. And, as you know, this is very damaging to the environment. In total, the house construction has released 70 tons of carbon dioxide into the air. Now that’s a frightening thought. However, once the initial ‘debt’ has been cleared – and it’s been calculated that this will only take\nfifteen years (Q40)\n– this underground house won’tcost anything – environmentally I mean – because unlike ordinary houses, it is run in a way that is completely environmentally friendly.\nSo, eco-housing like this is likely to become much more …\n剑桥雅思9 test3 Section4雅思听力答案\n31.

That was made of a double layer of very strong\nglass\n答案解析：听到south-facing意识到答案即将到来。空前词layer原词出现，由此锁定strong glass，因为题干要求只填一个单词，因此舍弃strong，保留glass。\n第34题答案：insulation\n对应原文：And the walls had a layer of foam around them too, to increase the\ninsulation\n答案解析：这道题的定位并不难，layer of foam原词出现，insulation读的也很重。但答案单词太过生僻，不少同学听到之后都不会拼写。\n第35题答案：windows\n对应原文：Sunlight floods in through the glass wall, and to maximise it there are lots of mirrors and\nwindows\ninside the house.\n答案解析：考察并列关系。不过这道题完全没有设置任何障碍，根据mirrors可以很容易确定答案。\n第36题答案：electricity\n对应原文：and it’s possible that in future the house may even generate an\nelectricity\nsurplus, and that the owners will be able to sell some to the national grid.\n答案解析：听到in future意识到答案即将到来，generate与produce同义替换，surplus与more同义替换，由此确定electricity为答案。\n第37题答案：floor/floors\n对应原文：As well as that, wherever possible, recycled materials have been used. For example, the\nfloors\nare made of reclaimed wood\n答案解析：这道题采用语序颠倒的手法，将原本位于空前的提示词wood放在了答案之后。不过我们仍然可以根据as well as这一连接词意识到答案即将到来。\n第38题答案：waste\n对应原文：And then there’s the system for dealing with the\nwaste\nproduced in the house.\n答案解析：这道题是该部分最难的一道。虽然system的提示作用很明显，但空前词domestic很多同学不认识，而且录音中waste读的也很轻。十分容易错过。\n第39题答案：concrete\n对应原文：It’s true that the actual construction of the house was harmful to the environment mainly because they had to use massive amounts of\nconcrete\n答案解析：听到environment意识到答案即将到来，large quantities of与massive amounts of同义替换，由此确定concrete（水泥）为答案。\n第40题答案：15 years\n对应原文：However, once the initial ‘debt’ has been cleared – and it’s been calculated that this will only take\nfifteen years\n答案解析：这道题的难点主要在于读题时候的预测。如果这时能够根据within意识到空上应该填一个时间，fifteen years就十分明显。如果没有意识到这一点，很有可能会因为觉得15 years太过简单而不敢往上填。"

Well, there’s Doctor Green at The Harvey Clinic. We always recommend her for\nbabies (Q1)\n,\nbecause she’s very good with them and she runs a special clinic.\nMAN\n: Oh … actually my youngest child is five, so that wouldn’t be any good for us.\nWOMAN\n: Right.\nMAN\n: Is there anywhere else I could try?\nWOMAN\n: Yes, the\nEshcol (Q2)\nHealth Practice is the next one on my list.\nMAN\n: How do you spell that?\nWOMAN\n: E-S-H-C-O-L. And it’s Doctor Fuller, who has space on his list. The clinic only opened a year ago, so the facilities are all very modern.\nMAN\n: That sounds good.\nWOMAN\n: And it’s particularly good if you’re busy during the day, because they also do appointments in the\nevening (Q3)\n. They’re closed on Saturday, though. The only other place on the list is the Health Centre on Shore Lane. You can register with Doctor\nGormley (Q4)\n, that’s G-O-R-M-L-E-Y. He’s new there, but the centre has a very good reputation.\nMAN\n: Oh yes, I think I know the road. That would be the best one. Thanks. Could you tell me, will all their services be free?\nWOMAN\n:  Erm … there are usually some small charges that doctors make. Let me see what it says about the Shore Lane Centre.\nIf you need to be vaccinated before any trips abroad, you won’t have to pay for this (Q5)\n. Erm, what else? The sports injury treatment service operates on a paying basis, as does the nutritional therapy service. Some health centres do offer alternative therapies like homeopathy as part of their pay-to-use service. Shore Lane are hoping to do this soon – I think they may start with acupuncture. And finally,\nif you need to prove you’re healthy or haven’t had any serious injuries before a new employer will accept you, you can get a free fitness check-up there (Q6)\n,\nbut you’d most likely have to pay for insurance medicals though.\nMAN\n: Okay, thanks.\nWOMAN\n: You might also be interested to know the Centre is running a pilot scheme of talks for patients. I’ve got the list here. Actually, they look very interesting.\nMAN\n: What sort of things?\nWOMAN\n: Well, the first one’s about giving up smoking. It’s next week, the twenty-fifth of February, at 7 pm, and that’s in Room 4. It says, the talk will stress the health benefits particularly for people with asthma or\nheart (Q7)\ndisease.\nMAN: That sounds very interesting.\nWOMAN\n: There’s also a talk for families with children. It’s on Healthy Eating, and takes place on the first of March at five o’clock.\nMAN\n: Will that be at the Health Centre?\nWOMAN\n: Erm, actually it’s at the\nprimary\nschool\n(Q8)\non Shore Lane. I imagine they’re inviting the parents of pupils there – it says here ‘all welcome’.\nMAN\n: Mmm, I might go to that if I have time.\nWOMAN\n: There’s a couple of other talks – one giving advice about how to avoid injuries while doing exercise. It’s on the ninth of March. Oh, it’s a late afternoon talk, at\nfour thirty (Q9)\n, and it’ll be in Room 6. It also says the talk is suitable for all\nages (Q10)\n.

We always recommend her for\nbabies\n,\nbecause she’s very good with them and she runs a special clinic.\n答案解析：听到Doctor Green和Harvey Clinic意识到答案即将到来。这道题采用语序颠倒的方式，将原本位于空前的good with放在了答案后面，并用them进行了指代，比较考验大家的短期记忆能力。不过因为babies读的很重，难度不算太大。\n第2题答案：Eshcol\n对应原文：Yes, the\nEshcol\nHealth Practice is the next one on my list.\n答案解析：考察姓名拼写。算得上是Section1的固定知识点，大多数情况下都是送分题。\n第3题答案：evening\n对应原文：And it’s particularly good if you’re busy during the day, because they also do appointments in the\nevening\n答案解析：appointment在这里是预约的意思，一般用于跟人的约定，比如理发师、医生等。除此之外，听力中还会考察reserve/reservation/book/booking这四个单词，表示预约座位，预约名额等。\n第4题答案：Gormley\n对应原文：You can register with Doctor\nGormley\n, that’s G-O-R-M-L-E-Y. He’s new there, but the centre has a very good reputation.\n答案解析：再次考察姓名拼写，没有什么特别值得注意的地方。\n第5题答案：B\n对应原文：And finally,\nif you need to prove you’re healthy or haven’t had any serious injuries before a new employer will accept you, you can get a free fitness check-up there\n答案解析：B选项的难点主要在于medical一词。它除了表示医药之外，还有体检的意思，对应题干中的fitness check-up。多选题中，选项一般都会乱序出现，所以大家要不停的扫视，不要死等A选项。\n第6题答案：E\n对应原文：\nIf you need to be vaccinated before any trips abroad, you won’t have to pay for this\n答案解析：考察vaccinate与vaccination的词性替换。难度不算太大。除此之外，这道题关于免费的问法在雅思听力Section1中是十分常见的。一般有以下三种替换方式：not pay，included in the package/price，以及free。\n第7题答案：heart\n对应原文： It says, the talk will stress the health benefits particularly for people with asthma or\nheart\ndisease.\n答案解析：答案本身的定位没有什么太大难点。不过因为发音的问题，heart可能会与hot比较接近。需要大家根据场景进行判断。\n第8题答案：primary school\n对应原文：Erm, actually it’s at the\nprimary\nschool\non Shore Lane. I imagine they’re inviting the parents of pupils there\n答案解析：采用他人更正的干扰项设置方式，由男性先提出Health Centre，再由女性更正为primary school。另外，与primary school同类的secondary school也经常考察，需要大家注意一下。\n第9题答案：4.30\n对应原文：It’s on the ninth of March. Oh, it’s a late afternoon talk, at\nfour thirty\n答案解析：雅思听力在考察半点这一时间时，很少说half past，大多数情况下都是直接读的数字。比如这道题就直接说的four thirty，而没有说half past four。\n第10题答案：ages\n对应原文： it’ll be in Room 6. It also says the talk is suitable for all\nages\n答案解析：这道题的难点主要在于all的尾音与ages的首音的连读，会给大家识别单词造成一定的困难。不过因为答案单词比较简单，难度不算太大。"

It’s Laura Carlton here. We’ve just arrived at the holiday flat, but I can’t get the hot water and heating to work.\nMAN: Oh right! That’s easy. Don’t worry. In the upstairs cupboard, you’ll find the water heater. You’ll see three main controls on the left at the bottom of the heater.\nThe first one – the round one on the far left – is the most important one for the heating and hot water. It’s the main control switch (Q11)\n. Make sure it’s in the ‘on’ position. The switch itself doesn’t light up, but the little square below will be black if the switch is ‘off’. That’s probably what’s happened – it’s got switched off by mistake. The middle one of these three controls – you’ll see it’s slightly larger than the first one – controls the radiators. If you feel cold while you’re there and need the radiators on, this needs to be turned to maximum. The last of the three controls – the one on the right – is usually on about a number four setting which for the water in the taps is usually quite hot enough.\nBelow the heating controls in the middle is a small round plastic button (Q12)\n. If there isn’t enough water in the pipes, sometimes the heater goes out.\nIf this happens you’ll need to press this button to reset the heater (Q12)\n. Hold it in for about five seconds and the heater should come on again. Then there’s\na little square indicator under the third knob that’s a kind of alarm light (Q13)\n. It’llflash if you need to reset the heater.\nWOMAN: It sounds complicated …\nMAN: I’m sure you won’t have any problems with it. There should be some more instructions on the side of the heater. Call me back if you can’t make it work.\nWOMAN: Okay.\nWOMAN: While you’re on the phone, we haven’t managed to find a few things we need, like extra pillows for the beds and some washing powder. Is there any here?\nMAN: Pillows … yes.\nIf you look in the cupboard, the large white one upstairs – to the left of the bathroom door (Q14)\n– there should be four or five on the top shelf. And if you want to do some washing,\nthere’s some powder for that… probably by the back door. There’s a kind of shelf there above the sink (Q15)\n. In fact, I’m sure there’s some there, in a large blue box. You need about half a cup full for each wash.\nAnd that reminds me,\nthe spare key to the back door is hanging on a hook\non the wall by the sitting room window (Q16)\n. Please make sure to put it back when you’ve used it. The previous guests lost it in the garden and I had to get another one made!  And if you have any trouble with the lamps, you’ll find\nsome spare bulbs in a large cardboard box. It’s on top of the washing machine (Q17)\nwith all kinds of useful things in it.\nOh, and another thing I forgot to mention when we last spoke …\nWOMAN: Yes?\nMAN:\nI’ve left you a local map (Q18)\n, so you’ll be able to find your way around easily. It shows the whole area. I put it\nin the top drawer of the chest (Q18)\nunder the TV in your bedroom. There’s a whole file of local information in there too.\nWOMAN: Thanks. What about visiting the town? Can you give us any advice?\nMAN: Yes. You’ll need to take the car. It’s too far to walk from the flat really. You have to pay to leave your car in all the car parks now I’m afraid … I like the one that’s by the station best and you can walk to the town centre from there in five minutes. That’s where all the best restaurants are. But if you want a takeaway, the Italian one does really good pasta and pizzas. Call\n7-3 double 2-8-1 (Q19)\nfor that one, or 7 double 6, double 1, 9 for the Chinese. They’re both good and they’ll both deliver to the flat.\nAs for places to visit, yes, do go and see the railway museum. The exhibition is small but really good. It gets very crowded on Sundays, so I suggest you visit it on a quieter day, later in the week, but not on\nThursdays (Q20)\nwhich is market day – you won’t find anywhere to park and it’s also the only day of the week when they’re not open! Anything else?\nWOMAN: Not for the moment. Thanks!\n剑桥雅思9 Test4 Section2雅思听力答案\n11. B\n12. C\n13. E\n14. B\n15. E\n16. D\n17. A\n18. C\n19. 732281\n20. Thursday/Thursdays"

It’s the main control switch. Make sure it’s in the ‘on’ position.\n答案解析：听到round将目光放在第一排的三个按钮上，听到far left即可确认说的是第11题，由此锁定main control switch，确定B为答案。\n第12题答案：C\n对应原文：Below the heating controls in the middle is a small round plastic button. If there isn’t enough water in the pipes, sometimes the heater goes out. If this happens you’ll need to press this button to reset the heater\n答案解析：这道题距离上一道题较远，需要一定的耐心。听到below the heating control即可确认说的是12题，在根据后面的reset判断C为答案。\n第13题答案：E\n对应原文：Then there’s\na little square indicator under the third knob that’s a kind of alarm light\n. It’llflash if you need to reset the heater.\n答案解析：听到under the third knob（第三个按钮下面），意识到文章来自老烤鸭雅思说的是第13题。原文中的alarm light与warning indicator同义替换，由此确定E为答案。\n第14题答案：B\n对应原文：\nIf you look in the cupboard, the large white one upstairs – to the left of the bathroom door\n答案解析：这道题的难点主要在于cupboard的读音。变成组合词之后board中oar不再发/ɔː/的音，而是变成了/ə/的音，会给单词识别造成一定困难。\n第15题答案：E\n对应原文： And if you want to do some washing,\nthere’s some powder for that… probably by the back door. There’s a kind of shelf there above the sink\n答案解析：这道题比较简单一些，听到back door和shelf即可确认E为答案。一些同学可能会受到后面sink的干扰，误选了G。但录音中说的是under而非above，由此排除。\n第16题答案：D\n对应原文：And that reminds me,\nthe spare key to the back door is hanging on a hook on the wall by the sitting room window\n答案解析：这道题一上来先说了back door，可能会让人怀疑上一道题的答案。但随后就又说了sitting room和window，由此确定D为答案。\n第17题答案：A\n对应原文：And if you have any trouble with the lamps, you’ll find\nsome spare bulbs in a large cardboard box. It’s on top of the washing machine\n答案解析：这道题比较简单一些，完全没有任何干扰项，也没有语音上的难点。根据box和washing machine即可确认A为答案。\n第18题答案：C\n对应原文：\nI’ve left you a local map\n, so you’ll be able to find your way around easily. It shows the whole area. I put it\nin the top drawer of the chest\nunder the TV in your bedroom.\n答案解析：这道题不少同学都会误选F。一方面是因为drawer of the chest读的比较弱，另一方面也是由于TV的干扰过于强烈。不过录音中说的是under，而非F选项中的on the top of，因此排除。\n第19题答案：732281\n对应原文：But if you want a takeaway, the Italian one does really good pasta and pizzas. Call\n7-3 double 2-8-1\n答案解析：这道题在后面设置了个中国食物的干扰项。不过迷惑性并不强，只要看准题干就好。\n第20题答案：Thursday/Thursdays\n对应原文：The exhibition is small but really good. It gets very crowded on Sundays, so I suggest you visit it on a quieter day, later in the week, but not on\nThursdays\nwhich is market day you won’t find anywhere to park and it’s also the only day of the week when they’re not open!\n答案解析：录音中提到了两个日期，分别为Sundays和Thursdays。前者人比较多，后者才是不开门的日子。只要守好题干中的限定条件就不算太难。"

It’s good to see you. It must be twelve months since you did our course?\nKIRA: That’s right. It’s nice to come back and say hello.\nPAUL: What course did you enrol in?\nKIRA: Actually, I went straight into third-year Pharmacy. They credited me with two years, which probably made it more difficult for me.\nPAUL: On the other hand, you were lucky to be granted credits. Is that why you chose the course?\nKIRA: Yes. And, as\nI’d already finished a course in it in my country (Q21)\n, I thought it would be easier if I studied something I already knew.\nPAUL: I didn’t realise you went into third year. I thought you started in the first year. No wonder it was so hard! And what do you think is one of the big differences between studying at a university here and studying in your country?\nKIRA: Well, I’ve found it very difficult to write assignments, because I wasn’t familiar with that aspect of the system here. The main problem is that the lecturers expect you to be critical. That made me feel really terrible. I thought “How can I possibly do it? How can I comment on someone else’s research when they probably spent five years doing it?” I think a lot of people who come from overseas countries have similar problems. But after a while, it became easier for me. People expect you to have problems with the process of reading and writing but, in fact,\nit is more a question of altering your viewpoint towards academic study (Q22)\n.\nPAUL:  How was the content of the lectures? Was it easy for you?\nKIRA: I didn’t really have many problems understanding lectures. The content was very similar to what I’d studied before.\nPAUL: And what about the lecturers themselves? Are they essentially the same as lecturers in your country?\nKIRA: Well actually, no. Here, they’re much easier to\napproach (Q23)\n. After every lecture you can go and ask them something you didn’t understand. Or you can make an appointment and talk to them about anything in the course.\nPAUL: Maybe you found them different because you’re a more\nmature (Q24)\nstudent now, whereas when you were studying in your country you were younger and not so assertive.\nKIRA: No, I don’t think that’s the difference. Most of the students here do it. In my faculty, they all seem to make appointments – usually to talk about something in the course that’s worrying them, but sometimes just about something that might really\ninterest (Q25)\nthem, something they might want to specialise in. The lecturers must set aside certain times every week when they’re available for students.\nPAUL: That’s good to hear.\nPAUL: And how was your timetable? Was it a very busy year?\nKIRA: Very, very busy. They make you work very hard. Apart from lectures, we had practical sessions in a lot of subjects. We did these\nin small groups (Q26)\n. I had to go and work four hours every week in a community pharmacy. Actually, I enjoyed this very much – meeting new people all the time. Then in second semester, we had to get experience in hospital dispensaries, so\nevery second day (Q27)\nwe went to one of the big hospitals and worked there. And on top of all that we had our assignments, which took me a lot of time. Oh, I nearly forgot, between first and second semesters, we had to work full-time for\ntwo weeks (Q28)\nin a hospital.\nPAUL: That does sound a very heavy year. So are you pleased now that you did it? Do you feel some sense of achievement?\nKIRA: Yeah, I do feel\nmuch more confident (Q29)\n, which I suppose is the most important thing.\nPAUL: And have you got any recommendations for people who are studying from overseas?\nKIRA: Well, I suppose they need very good English. It would be much better if they spent more time learning English before they enter the university, because you can be in big trouble if you don’t understand what people are saying and you haven’t got time to translate.\nPAUL: Anything else?\nKIRA: Well, as I said before, the biggest problem for me was a lack of familiarity with the\neducation system (Q30)\nhere.\nPAUL: It sounds as if it was a real challenge. Congratulations, Kira.\nKIRA: Thanks, Paul.\n剑桥雅思9 Test4 Section3雅思听力答案\n21. A\n22.

And, as\nI’d already finished a course in it in my country\n, I thought it would be easier if I studied something I already knew.\n答案解析：录音中提到，Kira在自己国家已经完成过该专业的课程，由此确定A为答案。B选项错在是学校给了她两年的学分，而非在读了两年的课程，因此排除。原文中没有提到她对该课程的感受，因此C选项也排除。\n第22题答案：C\n对应原文：People expect you to have problems with the process of reading and writing but, in fact,\nit is more a question of altering your viewpoint towards academic study\n答案解析：C选项中，change与alter对应，way of thinking与viewpoint对应，由此确定答案。A选项和B选项则都完全没有提到。\n第23题答案：approach\n对应原文：Well actually, no. Here, they’re much easier to\napproach\n答案解析：听到老师提起lecturers意识到答案即将到来。空前词easier原词出现，由此确定approach为答案。\n第24题答案：mature\n对应原文：Maybe you found them different because you’re a more\nmature\nstudent now\n答案解析：答案的定位不难，主要还是拼写比较麻烦一些。不过这本书的Test2 Section 1已经考察过一次该单词，不知道大家还有没有印象。\n第25题答案：interest\n对应原文：usually to talk about something in the course that’s worrying them, but sometimes just about something that might really\ninterest\nthem, something they might want to specialise in.\n答案解析：听到worrying them意识到答案即将到来，根据并列关系和空后的them确定interest为答案。这里用的是interest的动词文章来自老烤鸭雅思形式，表示使…感兴趣，使…关注的意思。\n第26题答案：groups\n对应原文：Apart from lectures, we had practical sessions in a lot of subjects. We did these\nin small groups\n答案解析：听到practical sessions意识到答案即将到来。从题干中的疑问词how可以推断出空上应该填某种方式，由此确定答案为in small groups。虽然剑桥雅思后面的答案只给了groups，但在不超字数的情况下，添加修饰词并不算错。\n第27题答案：every 2 days\n对应原文：Then in second semester, we had to get experience in hospital dispensaries, so\nevery second day\n答案解析：听到hospital意识到答案即将出现，题干中的how often提示我们空上应该填一个频率，由此锁定every second day。剑桥雅思书后面给的every 2 days算是答案的同义替换，两者均可。\n第28题答案：2 weeks\n对应原文：Oh, I nearly forgot, between first and second semesters, we had to work full-time for\ntwo weeks\nin a hospital.\n答案解析：虽然how much这一提问方式稍微有些含糊不清。但full-time之后能作为答案的只有two weeks。\n第29题答案：confident\n对应原文：Yeah, I do feel\nmuch more confident\n, which I suppose is the most important thing.\n答案解析：跟26题类似，虽然本书后面给的答案只有confident。但加上原文中much more的限定肯定是不算错的。\n第30题答案：education system\n对应原文：Well, as I said before, the biggest problem for me was a lack of familiarity with the\neducation system\nhere.\n答案解析：一些同学可能会将前面提到的English当作答案。但题干开头说的是in addition to the language，即除了语言之外还有什么，因此排除English。题干中的familiar与录音中的familiarity词性替换，由此确定答案为education system。"

Today I’d like to present the findings of our Year 2 project on wildlife found in gardens throughout our city. I’ll start by saying something about the background to the project, then talk a little bit about our research techniques, and then indicate some of our interim findings.\nFirst of all, how did we choose our topic? Well, there are four of us in the group and one day while we were discussing a possible focus,\ntwo of the group mentioned that they had seen yet more sparrow-hawks – one of Britain’s most interesting birds of prey – in their own city centre gardens and wondered why they were turning up in these gardens in great numbers (Q31)\n.\nWe were all very engaged by the idea of why wild animals would choose to inhabit a city garden. Why is it so popular with wildlife when the countryside itself is becoming less so?\nThe first thing we did was to establish what proportion of the urban land is taken up by private gardens. We estimated that it was about one fifth, and\nthis was endorsed by looking at large-scale usage maps in the town land survey office (Q32)\n– 24% to be precise. Our own informal discussions with neighbours and friends led us to believe that many garden owners had interesting experiences to relate regarding wild animal sightings so we decided to\nsurvey garden owners from different areas of the city. Just over 100 of them completed a survey once every two weeks for twelve months – ticking off species they\nhad seen from a pro form a list – and adding the names of any rarer ones\n(Q33)\n. Meanwhile,  we were doing our own observations in selected gardens throughout the city.\nWe deliberately chose smaller ones because they were by far the most typical in the city The whole point of the project was to look at the norm not the exception (Q34)\n.\nAlongside this primary research on urban gardens,\nwe were studying a lot of books about the decline of wild animals in the countryside (Q35)\nand thinking of possible causes for this.\nSo what did we find? Well, so much that I just won’t have time to tell you about here. If you’re interested in reading our more comprehensive findings, we’ve produced detailed graphic representations on the college web-site and of course any of the group would be happy to talk to you about them. Just email us.\nWhat we’ve decided to present today is information about just three species – because we felt these gave a good indication of the processes at work in rural and urban setting s as a whole (Q36)\n.\nThe first species to generate a lot of interesting information was frogs (Q37)\n. And there was a clear pattern here – they proliferate where there is suitable water. Garden ponds are on the increase, rural ponds are disappearing, leading to massive migration to the towns.\nHedgehogs are also finding it easier to live in urban areas – this time because\ntheir predators are not finding it quite so attractive to leave their rural environment, so hedgehogs have a better survival rate in cities (Q38)\nWe had lots of sightings, so all in all\nwe had no difficulties with our efforts to count their numbers precisely (Q39)\n.\nOur final species is the finest of bird singers, the song thrush. On the decline in the countryside, they are experiencing a resurgence in urban gardens because these days gardeners are buying lots of different plants which means\nthere’s an extensive range of seeds around, which is what they feed on (Q40)\n. Another factor is the provision of nesting places – which is actually better in gardens than the countryside. Hard to believe it, but it’s true. Incidentally, we discovered that a massive new survey on song thrushes is about to be launched, so you should keep an eye open for that.\nNow, I’d be happy to answer any questions you may have …\n剑桥雅思9 Test4 Section4雅思听力答案\n31.

Just over 100 of them completed a survey once every two weeks for twelve months – ticking off species they had seen from a pro form a list – and adding the names of any rarer ones\n答案解析：录音中提到他们要求花园所有者在12个月的时间里，每两周完成一次调查。划掉他们看到的物种，加上任何稀有物种的名字。即记录所看到的动物。这道题的难点跟第31题一样，都是正确选项的概括太过简略，不像是我们平时所熟悉的词汇或短语的同义替换。\n第34题答案：B\n对应原文：We deliberately chose smaller ones because they were by far the most typical in the city. The whole point of the project was to look at the norm not the exception\n答案解析：这道题要相对简单一些，只要能够抓住typical和representative的同义替换，即可确定B为答案。\n第35题答案：A\n对应原文：Alongside this primary research on urban gardens,\nwe were studying a lot of books about the decline of wild animals in the countryside\nand thinking of possible causes for this.\n答案解析：这道题进行了大量的同义替换。先是将题干中的extensive reading替换为a lot of books，然后又将animals替换成wildlife，countryside替换成rurual areas，由此确定A为答案。\n第36题答案：C\n对应原文：What we’ve decided to resent today is information about just three species – because we felt these gave a good indication of the processes at work in rural and urban settings as a whole\n答案解析：这道题要稍微简单一些，好歹有个because的提示。indicate与indication词性替换，as a whole则对应general trends，由此确定C为答案。而无论是A选项的a lot of data，还是B选项的most interest，在原文中都找不到对应点。\n第37题答案：frog/frogs\n对应原文：The first species to generate a lot of interesting information was\nfrogs\n答案解析：从表头可以推断出空上应该填一种生物。first species有一定的提示作用，帮助我们确定后面的frogs为答案。不过因为这道题离上一道题距离太近，给我们增加了额外的困难。\n第38题答案：predators\n对应原文：Hedgehogs are also finding it easier to live in urban areas – this time because their\npredators\nare not finding it quite so attractive to leave their rural environment, so hedgehogs have a better survival rate in cities\n答案解析：听到Hedgehogs意识到答案即将到来，原文对safer进行了词义解释，找不到直接的对应词，只能通过词性和句义来判断答案。\n第39题答案：count\n对应原文：We had lots of sightings, so all in all we had no difficulties with our efforts to\ncount\ntheir numbers precisely\n答案解析：空前词easy被替换成no difficulties，从题干可以推测空上应该填一个动词，由此确定答案为count。\n第40题答案：seed/seeds\n对应原文：they are experiencing a resurgence in urban gardens because these days gardeners are buying lots of different plants which means there’s an extensive range of\nseeds\naround, which is what they feed on\n答案解析：不少同学会根据空前的a variety of将plants当作答案。但它并不符合空后to eat这一信息点。an extensive range of与a variety of同义替换，feed on与eat同义替换，由此舍弃plants，锁定seeds为答案。"
