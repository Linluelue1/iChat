原文
Welcome to this podcast about the Sheepmarket, which is one of the oldest parts of the city.
As its name suggests, there was originally a market here where farmers brought their sheep, but now it’s been redeveloped into a buzzing,
vibrant
area of the city, which is also home to one of the city’s fastest-growing communities.
The nearby university has always meant the area’s popular with students, who come in to enjoy the lively nightlife,
but now graduates embarking on careers in the worlds of fashion and design are buying up the new apartments recently built here to replace the small houses where the market workers used to live (Q11)
.
The narrow old side streets are great places for finding original pictures, jewellery and ceramics (Q12)
which won’t break the bank, as well as local produce like fruit and vegetables.
There’s also lots of pavement cafes where you can have a coffee and watch tourists from all over the world go by.
The oldest buildings in the area are on the main streets, including the city’s first department store, built in the 1880s, which is still open today.
The Sheepmarket is a centre for fashion, and there’s a policy of encouraging new young designers.
The Young Fashion competition is open to local young people who are passion about fashion.
This year they’ve been asked to design an outfit based on ideas from the music and technology that’s part of their everyday life (Q13)
, using both natural and man-made fibres.
The garments will be judged by a
panel
of experts and fashion designers, and the winning entries will be modelled at a special gala evening.
Parking at the Sheepmarket is easy.
There are plenty of pay and display car parking spaces on the roadsides which are fine if you just want to stay for an hour or two, but if you want to spend the day there it’s better to park in one of the four underground car parks.
It’s not expensive and
if you can present a receipt from one of the local stores, you’ll not be charged at all (Q14)
.
After six pm many of the car parks have a flat rate which varies but it is usually very reasonable.
The Sheepmarket is one of the main centres for art and history in the whole of the country.
If you look at our map, you’ll see some of the main attractions there.
Most visitors start from Crawley Road, at the bottom of the map.
The Reynolds House
is one of the oldest houses in the city, and is open to the public.
It’s on the north side of Crawley Road, next to the footpath that leads to the public gardens (Q15)
.
The area’s particularly interesting for its unusual sculptures.
‘
The Thumb
‘ is just what its name suggests.
But it’s about 10 metres high.
You’ll see it on Hill Road, across the road from the Bank (Q16)
.
The Museum
‘s got a particularly fine collection of New Zealand landscapes.
It’s on the east side of the Sheepmarket, on City Road.
It’s on the other side of the road from the public gardens, immediately facing the junction with Hill Road (Q17)
.
The
Contemporary
Art Gallery
is on a little road that leads off Station Square, not far from the public gardens.
The road ends at the gallery — it doesn’t go anywhere else (Q18)
.
That’s open every day except Mondays.
The Warner Gallery specialises in 19th-century art.
It’s on City Road, near the junction with Crawley Road, on the same side of the road as the public gardens (Q19)
.
It’s open on weekdays from 9 to 5, and entry is free.
Finally, if you’re interested in purchasing high quality artwork, the place to go is
Nucleus.
You need to go from Crawley Road up through Station Square and east along Hill Road until you get to a small winding road turning off.
Go up there and it’s on your right — if you get to City Road you’ve gone too far (Q20).

雅思听力
原文
Hello, I’m delighted to welcome you to our Wildlife Club, and very pleased that you’re interested in the countryside and the plants and creatures of this area. I think you’ll be surprised at the variety we have here, even though we’re not far from London. I’ll start by telling you about some of the parks and open spaces nearby.
One very pleasant place is Halland Common. This has been public land for hundreds of years, and what you’ll find interesting is that the River Ouse, which flows into the sea eighty kilometres away, has its source in the common. There’s an information board about the plants and animals you can see here, and by the way, the common is accessible 24 hours a day.
Then there’s Holt Island, which is noted for its great range of
trees (Q11)
. In the past willows were grown here commercially for basket-making, and this ancient craft has recently been reintroduced. The island is only open to the public
from Friday to Sunday (Q12)
, because it’s quite small, and if there were people around every day, much of the wildlife would keep away.
From there it’s just a short walk across the bridge to Longfield Country Park. Longfield has a modern replica of a
farm
(Q13)
from over two thousand years ago. Children’s activities are often arranged there, like bread-making and face-painting. The park is only open during daylight hours, so bear that in mind if you decide to go there.
Longfield Park has a programme of activities throughout the year, and to give you a sample, this is what’s happening in the next few days. On Monday you can learn about herbs, and how they’ve been used over the centuries. You’ll start with a tour of our herb garden,
practise the technique of using them as colour dyes for cloth (Q14)
, and listen to an illustrated talk about their use in cooking and medicine.
Then on Wednesday, you can join local experts to discover the variety of insects and birds that appear in the evening. We keep to a small number of people in the group,
so if you want to go you’ll need to phone the park ranger a few days ahead (Q15)
. There’s a small charge, which you should pay when you turn up.
I’m sure you’re all keen to help with the practical task of looking after the park, so on Saturday, you can join a working party. You’ll have a choice of all sorts of activities, from planting hedges to picking up litter, so you’ll be able to change from one to another when you feel like it. The rangers will be hard at work all day, but do come and join in, even for just a short while. One thing, though, is to
make sure you’re wearing something that you don’t mind getting dirty or torn (Q16)
.
And finally, I’d like to tell you about our new wildlife area, Hinchingbrooke Park, which will be opened to the public next month. This slide doesn’t really indicate how big it is, but anyway, you can see the two gates into the park, and the main paths. As you can see, there’s a lake in the north-west of the park, with
a bird hide to the west of it, at the end of a path (Q17)
. So it’ll be a nice quiet place for watching the birds on the lake.
Fairly close to where refreshments are available,
there’s a dog-walking area in the
southern part of the park (Q18)
, leading off from the path. And if you just want to sit and relax, you can go to
the flower garden; that’s the circular area on the map surrounded by paths (Q19)
.
And finally, there’s
a wooded area in the western section of the park between two paths (Q20)
.
Okay, that’s enough from me, so let’s go on to …

剑桥雅思4 test 1 Section 4听力原文 the urban landscape
题型上来看，剑4 test 1 Section 4的这10道题目十分符合现在Section 4以填空题为主的出题趋势。内容上来看，它介绍的城市环境规划也算是这部分比较主流的话题。
但与现在真正的考试相比，它的难度太小。这主要体现在两方面。其一，语速较慢，整体文章的题目分布十分平均，考生很难跟丢。其二，题目中的句子结构与听力原文中的句子结构基本相同。甚至空前后词都有大量相同的地方，使得定位答案毫无难度。所以如果大家这部分做的比较好，千万不要因此而骄傲自满。认为雅思听力不过如此。
以下是剑4 test 1 Section 4雅思听力题目对应的原文，以供大家参考：
Good day, ladies and gentlemen. I have been asked today to talk to you about the urban landscape. There are two major areas that I will focus on in my talk: how vegetation can have a significant effect on urban climate, and how we can better plan our
cities using trees to provide a more comfortable environment
for us to live in.
Q31
Trees can have a significant impact on our cities. They can make a city, as a whole,
a bit less
windy
or a bit more windy, if that’s what you want. They can make it a bit cooler if it’s a hot summer day in an Australian city,  they can make it
a bit more
humid
if it’s a dry inland city. On the local scale – that is, in particular areas within the city – trees can make the
local area more shady
, cooler, more humid and much less windy. In fact, trees and planting of various kinds can be used to make city streets
actually less dangerous
in particular areas. How do trees do all that, you ask?
Q32 Q33 Q34 Q35
Well, the main difference between a tree and a building is a tree has got an internal mechanism to keep the temperature regulated. It
evaporates water through its leaves
and that means that the temperature of the leaves is never very far from our own body temperature. The temperature of a building surface on a hot sunny day can easily be twenty degrees more than our temperature. Trees, on the other hand, remain cooler than buildings because they sweat. This means that they can humidify the air and cool it – a property which can be exploited to improve the local climate.
Q36
Trees can also help break the force of winds. The reason that high buildings make it windier
at ground level
is that, as the wind goes higher and higher, it goes faster and faster. When the wind hits the building, it has to go somewhere. Some of it goes over the top and some go around the sides of the building, forcing those high-level winds down to ground level. That doesn’t happen when you have trees.
Trees
filter the wind and considerably reduce it.
preventing those very large strong gusts that you so often find around tall buildings.
Q37 Q38
Another problem in built-up areas is that traffic noise is intensified by tall buildings. By planting a belt of trees at the side of the road, you can make things a little quieter, but much of the vehicle noise still goes through the trees. Trees can also help reduce the amount of noise in the surroundings, although the effect is not as large as people like to think.
Low- frequency noise
, in particular, just goes through the trees as though they aren’t there.
Q39
Although trees can significantly improve the local climate, they do however take up a lot of space. There are root systems to consider and branches blocking windows and so on. It may, therefore, be difficult to fit trees into the local landscape. There is not a great deal you can do if you have what we call a street canyon – a whole set of high-rises enclosed in a narrow street. Trees need water to grow. They also need some sunlight to grow and
you need room to put them
. If you have the chance of knocking buildings down and replacing them, then suddenly you can start looking at different ways to design the streets and to introduce… (fade out)

原文
Good morning. Today I’d like to present the findings of our Year 2 project on wildlife found in gardens throughout our city. I’ll start by saying something about the background to the project, then talk a little bit about our research techniques, and then indicate some of our interim findings.
First of all, how did we choose our topic? Well, there are four of us in the group and one day while we were discussing a possible focus,
two of the group mentioned that they had seen yet more sparrow-hawks – one of Britain’s most interesting birds of prey – in their own city centre gardens and wondered why they were turning up in these gardens in great numbers (Q31)
.
We were all very engaged by the idea of why wild animals would choose to inhabit a city garden. Why is it so popular with wildlife when the countryside itself is becoming less so?
The first thing we did was to establish what proportion of the urban land is taken up by private gardens. We estimated that it was about one fifth, and
this was endorsed by looking at large-scale usage maps in the town land survey office (Q32)
– 24% to be precise. Our own informal discussions with neighbours and friends led us to believe that many garden owners had interesting experiences to relate regarding wild animal sightings so we decided to
survey garden owners from different areas of the city. Just over 100 of them completed a survey once every two weeks for twelve months – ticking off species they
had seen from a pro form a list – and adding the names of any rarer ones
(Q33)
. Meanwhile,  we were doing our own observations in selected gardens throughout the city.
We deliberately chose smaller ones because they were by far the most typical in the city The whole point of the project was to look at the norm not the exception (Q34)
.
Alongside this primary research on urban gardens,
we were studying a lot of books about the decline of wild animals in the countryside (Q35)
and thinking of possible causes for this.
So what did we find? Well, so much that I just won’t have time to tell you about here. If you’re interested in reading our more comprehensive findings, we’ve produced detailed graphic representations on the college web-site and of course any of the group would be happy to talk to you about them. Just email us.
What we’ve decided to present today is information about just three species – because we felt these gave a good indication of the processes at work in rural and urban setting s as a whole (Q36)
.
The first species to generate a lot of interesting information was frogs (Q37)
. And there was a clear pattern here – they proliferate where there is suitable water. Garden ponds are on the increase, rural ponds are disappearing, leading to massive migration to the towns.
Hedgehogs are also finding it easier to live in urban areas – this time because
their predators are not finding it quite so attractive to leave their rural environment, so hedgehogs have a better survival rate in cities (Q38)
We had lots of sightings, so all in all
we had no difficulties with our efforts to count their numbers precisely (Q39)
.
Our final species is the finest of bird singers, the song thrush. On the decline in the countryside, they are experiencing a resurgence in urban gardens because these days gardeners are buying lots of different plants which means
there’s an extensive range of seeds around, which is what they feed on (Q40)
. Another factor is the provision of nesting places – which is actually better in gardens than the countryside. Hard to believe it, but it’s true. Incidentally, we discovered that a massive new survey on song thrushes is about to be launched, so you should keep an eye open for that.
Now, I’d be happy to answer any questions you may have …

Hello and welcome to today’s ‘Buyer Beware’ program, where we give you some tips on how to spend your money wisely. Now, in today’s show we’re looking at beds for children and babies. Let’s start by looking at baby cots, that’s for children of up to three years old. We tested three different cots all in the budget price range and, as usual, we will feature the good points, the problems and our verdict.
The first cot we looked at was by Baby Safe and it had several good points to recommend it. Our testers liked the fact that it had four wheels, so it was easy to
move around
. The only slight problems with this cot were that it had no
brakes
, but they didn’t think that mattered too much. At first, they were a bit concerned about the sidebar, because they felt babies could trap their
fingers
in it, but our testers felt that this was unlikely to happen so they have given this one a verdict of ‘
satisfactory
’.
Q11, Q12, Q13, Q14
The next cot was by Choice Cots and this time our testers were pleased to find a cot which is simple to
put together
– unlike others we looked at. On the minus side, our testers did not like the fact that the side of the cot did not drop down, making it difficult to pick up newborn babies. However, the real problem with this cot was the space between the bars; our testers found they were
too wide
and a baby could easily trap his head. We felt this was a real safety hazard and so we have labeled this one
dangerous
, I’m afraid.
Q15, Q16, Q17
And finally better news for the Mother’s Choice cot. This cot was slightly different in that, although the sidebar did not drop down, the base could be raised or lowered into two different positions making it safe as well as convenient. The negatives for this one were quite minor; the only niggle everyone had was the fact that it has no
wheels
and the only other problem anyone could find, was that there were pictures which were simply stuck on and so could easily become detached. The makers have now promised to discontinue this practice. As this cot will then be safe in every way, we have made the Mother’s Choice cot our
best buy
. Congratulations Mother’s Choice!
Q18, Q19
So, what features should you look for in a baby’s cot? Well, obviously safety is a very important factor as well as comfort and convenience. We recommend that, if you are buying a cot, do make sure that any metal present is not rusted or bent in any way. You should ensure your cot has only rounded or smooth edging without any
sharp
edges, this is especially important for wooden cots.
Q20
And now on to beds for toddlers …

剑桥雅思10
test2 Section4
雅思听力
原文
Well, I’ve been talking to managers in a number of businesses, and reading surveys about the future of management.
And what I’m going to present in this seminar is a few ideas about how the activity is likely to change in the next ten years.
It isn’t a scientific,
statistical
analysis—just some ideas for us to discuss.
One area I want to mention is business markets, and I’m sure a really significant development will be a major increase in
competition (Q31)
, with companies from all round the world trying to sell similar products.
Consumers will have much more choice—for
instance
, food products sold in Australia might be manufactured in the USA, China, Finland and dozens of other countries.
At the same time, mergers and takeovers mean that governments are actually losing power to major
global
(Q32)
corporations.
We can probably all think of companies that
exert
a great deal of influence, which may be good for consumers.
A third point I want to make about markets is that in the rapidly expanding economies, such as India, China, Brazil and Russia,
demand (Q33)
is growing very fast.
This is putting pressure on resources all over the world.
I think businesses are becoming more open to external influences.
In
particular
, companies are consulting
customers (Q34)
more and more before making their business decisions.
Companies are finding out what they want and providing it, instead of making products and then trying to sell them, which is the model of years ago.
Another influence is that concerns about the environment will force manufacturers to extend product lifecycles, to reduce the amount of pollution and waste.
And in some cases,
regulation (Q35)
will need to be strengthened.
Many societies are much more
fluid
and
democratic
, and the structure of companies is changing to
reflect
that.
I think we’re going to see a greater emphasis within companies on teams created with a specific
project (Q36)
in mind.
And when they’re completed, the teams will be disbanded and new ones formed.
More and more people see work as simply one part of their lifestyle, and not the most important one, and as the workforce is shrinking in some countries, businesses are having to compete for staff instead of being able to choose among a lot of applicants.
Typical examples that will attract and
retain
staff are traditional ones like
flexible
(Q37)
hours and—something that has been made possible by advances in technology—remote working, with people based at their home, abroad, or almost anywhere they choose.
Management styles will almost certainly continue to change.
Senior managers will require a lot more than the efficiency that they’ve always needed.
Above all they’ll need great skills in
leadership (Q38)
, so that their organisation can
initiate
and respond to change in a fast-moving world, where they face lots of competing requirements and
potential
conflicts.
In most of the world, the senior managers of large businesses are mainly men in their fifties and sixties.
The
predominant
style of management will almost certainly become more
consultative
and
collaborative
, caused above all, by more
women (Q39)
moving into senior management positions.
Many of the changes are influenced by developments in the wider economy.
The traditional emphasis of business was
manufacturing
, and of course the service sector is very important.
But we shouldn’t overlook the growing financial contribution of IP, that is, intellectual property.
Some books and films
generate
enormous sums from the sale of related DVDs, music, games, clothes, and so on.
Another point I’d like to make is that although I’ve been talking about companies, one trend that they have to face is the move away from people working for the same employer for years.
Instead, more and more people are becoming
self-employed (Q40)
, to gain the freedom and control over their lives that they’re unlikely to get from being employed.
OK, well that’s all I want to say, so let’s open it up for discussion.

雅思听力
原文
Good morning everyone. Last week we were looking at the hunter-gatherers in Ireland, across the Irish Sea from England. Today, we’re going to move on to the period between four and six thousand years ago, known as the Neolithic period, which is when a total farming economy was introduced in Ireland.
Now,
there are several hypotheses about the origins of the first Neolithic settlers in Ireland, but most of these contain problems
. For instance, there are considerable archaeological difficulties about the theory that they came from England. The evidence doesn’t really add up. But there are even greater practical problems about the theory that they came directly from continental Europe. For one thing, it’s not clear just how sufficient numbers of men and women could have been transported to Ireland to establish a viable population. As you know, the hunter-gatherer economy which existed beforehand was based on small scattered groups. The farming economy would almost certainly have required much larger communities to do all the work needed to plant and tend sufficient crops to sustain them through the year.
Q31
The early farmers kept various animals, including cattle and sheep. There’s also evidence of pigs, but it is possible that these could have been descended from the native wild species. Now, we know from modern farming that if the level of breeding stock falls below about three hundred females, the future of the species locally is at risk. So we must assume that
from the beginnings of Neolithic farming the number of breeding sheep would have considerably exceeded three hundred, and the national cattle herd must have been of a similar size
. The question is how these were brought to the area and where they came from.
Q32
It’s usually suggested that the
Neolithic settlers used skin-covered boats to transport livestock. But this method would have severely restricted the range of the colonising fleets
. The sheer volume of animal transport necessary means it’s unlikely that this livestock could have been brought from anywhere further than England.
Q33
What about crops? Well, two main cereal crops were introduced to Ireland during this time: wheat and barley, both in several varieties.
The main evidence for their presence consists of impressions on pottery, where a cereal grain accidentally became embedded in the surface of a pot
before it was fired. The grain itself was destroyed by the firing, but it left an impression on the pot which could be studied and identified by botanists.
Q34
Let’s turn our attention now to the farming technology available at that time. Before the cereal crops could be planted, it would have been necessary to clear the forest and to break the ground by ploughing. The stone blade of a plough has been discovered during excavation in County Mayo in western Ireland. The body of the plough would have been of wood and could have been drawn by
people
, but it’s also likely that cattle were used.
Q35
Now, the cultivation of crops and the husbandry of livestock brought about changes in people’s lifestyle such as the type of shelters they made. For one thing, instead of moving from place to place they needed permanent dwellings. The stone axes used to chop down trees to make these dwellings were far superior to any that the Stone Age hunter-gatherers used.
To make the axes, sources of suitable stone had to be found and systematically exploited. These so-called ‘axe factories’ were really quarries rather than factories, as the manufacture of the axes wasn’t regularly performed on the quarry site. However, after the axe had been chipped into shape, they needed
water
and
sand
for grinding and polishing, so a high mountainside wouldn’t have been an appropriate place for this. So this final stage of the manufacture must have been carried out close to water and sure enough, there’s ample evidence of this at coastal sites.
Q36
Now it’s clear that these Neolithic axes were transported all over Ireland, as well as to
Scotland
and the south of England. It’s not really surprising that axes from ‘axe factories’ in England have also been found in Ireland. At the very least, this indicates that there was a link between the two islands during that period.
Q37
One of the most useful innovations of the colonisers was pottery making, which was quite unknown to Irish hunter-gatherers. The pottery was probably made by shaping clay into a ball with the hand, and then hollowing it until the walls were the right thickness. After firing, the
outside
was often polished. This would have helped the pots to retain water, as they weren’t glazed. Now we know that the clay used usually came from
local
sources, which suggests that manufacture was on a fairly small scale, even though thousands of fragments are usually found at Neolithic sites.
Q38    Q39
In the course of time decoration began to appear. At first this looked like a series of stitches and was just around the
tops
of the
pots
. This could have been an imitation of earlier vessels which were made of leather sewn onto wood. Then eventually pots with decoration all over…

剑桥雅思14 test2 section4
雅思听力
原文
In this series of lectures about the history of weather forecasting, I’ll start by examining its early history – that’ll be the subject of today’s talk.
OK, so we’ll start by going back thousands of years. Most ancient cultures had weather gods, and weather catastrophes, such as floods, played an important role in many creation myths. Generally, weather was attributed to the whims of the gods, as the wide range of weather gods in various cultures shows. For instance, there’s the Egyptian sun god Ra, and Thor, the Norse god of thunder and lightning. Many ancient civilisations developed rites such as
dances (Q31)
in order to make the weather gods look kindly on them.
But the weather was of daily importance: observing the skies and drawing the correct conclusions from these observations was really important, in fact their
survival (Q32)
depended on it. It isn’t known when people first started to observe the skies, but at around 650 BC, the Babylonians produced the first short-range weather forecasts, based on their observations of
clouds (Q33)
and other phenomena. The Chinese also recognised weather patterns, and by 300 BC, astronomers had developed a calendar which divided the year into 24
festivals (Q34)
, each associated with a different weather phenomenon.
The ancient Greeks were the first to develop a more scientific approach to explaining the weather. The work of the philosopher and scientist Aristotle, in the fourth century BC, is especially noteworthy, as his ideas held sway for nearly 2,000 years. In 340 BC, he wrote a book in which he attempted to account for the formation of rain, clouds, wind and storms. He also described celestial phenomena such as haloes – that is, bright circles of light around the sun, the moon and bright stars – and
comets (Q35)
. . Many of his observations were surprisingly accurate. For example, he believed that heat could cause water to evaporate. But he also jumped to quite a few wrong conclusions, such as that winds are breathed out by the Earth. Errors like this were rectified from the Renaissance onwards.
For nearly 2,000 years, Aristotle’s work was accepted as the chief authority on weather theory. Alongside this, though, in the Middle Ages weather observations were passed on in the form of proverbs, such as ‘Red sky at night, shepherd’s delight; red
sky (Q36)
in the morning, shepherd’s warning’. Many of these are based on very good observations and are accurate, as contemporary meteorologists have discovered.
For centuries, any attempt to forecast the weather could only be based on personal observations, but in the fifteenth century scientists began to see the need for
instruments (Q37)
. Until then, the only ones available were weather vanes – to determine the wind direction – and early versions of rain gauges. One of the first, invented in the fifteenth century, was a hygrometer, which measured humidity. This was one of many inventions that contributed to the development of weather forecasting.
In 1592, the Italian scientist and inventor Galileo developed the world’s first
thermometer (Q38)
. His student Torricelli later invented the barometer, which allowed people to measure atmospheric pressure. In 1648, the French philosopher Pascal proved that pressure decreases with altitude. This discovery was verified by English astronomer Halley in 1686; and Halley was also the first person to map trade winds.
This increasing ability to measure factors related to weather helped scientists to understand the atmosphere and its processes better, and they started collecting weather observation data systematically. In the eighteenth century, the scientist and politician Benjamin Franklin carried out work on electricity and lightning in particular, but he was also very interested in weather and studied it throughout most of his life. It was Franklin who discovered that
storms (Q39)
generally travel from west to east.
In addition to new meteorological instruments, other developments contributed to our understanding of the atmosphere. People in different locations began to keep records, and in the mid-nineteenth century, the invention of the
telegraph (Q40)
made it possible for these records to be collated. This led, by the end of the nineteenth century, to the first weather services.
It was not until the early twentieth century that mathematics and physics became part of meteorology, and we’ll continue from that point next week.

剑桥雅思11
test3 Section4
雅思听力
原文
So what I’m going to talk about to you today is something called
Ethnography
.
This is a type of research aimed at exploring the way human cultures work.
It was first developed for use in
anthropology
, and it’s also been used in sociology and communication studies.
So what’s it got to do with business, you may ask.
Well, businesses are finding that
ethnography
can offer them deeper insight into the possible needs of customers, either present or future, as well as providing valuable information about their
attitudes (Q31)
towards existing products.
And
ethnography
can also help companies to design new products or services that customers really want.
Let’s look at some examples of how
ethnographic
research works in business.
One team of researchers did a project for a company
manufacturing
kitchen equipment.
They watched how cooks used measuring cups to measure out things like sugar and
flour
.
They saw that the cooks had to check and recheck the contents, because although the measuring cups had
numbers (Q32)
inside them, the cooks couldn’t see these easily.
So a new design of cup was developed to overcome this problem, and it was a top seller.
Another team of
ethnographic
researchers looked at how cell phones were used in Uganda, in Africa.
They found that people who didn’t have their own phones could pay to use the phones of local entrepreneurs.
Because these customers paid in advance for their calls, they were eager to know how much
time (Q33)
they’d spent on the call so far.
So the phone company designed phones for use globally with this added feature.
Ethnographic
research has also been carried out in computer companies.
In one company, IT systems administrators were observed for several weeks.
It was found that a large amount of their work involved communicating with colleagues in order to solve problems, but that they didn’t have a standard way of exchanging information from spreadsheets and so on.
So the team came up with an idea for
software (Q34)
that would help them to do this.
In another piece of research, a team observed and talked to nurses working in hospitals.
This led to the recognition that the nurses needed to access the computer records of their
patients (Q35)
, no matter where they were.
This led to the development of a
portable
computer
tablet
that allowed the nurses to check records in locations throughout the hospital.
Occasionally, research can be done even in environments where the researchers can’t be present.
For example, in one project done for an airline, respondents used their smartphones to record information during airline trips, in a study aiming at tracking the
emotions (Q36)
of passengers during a flight.
So what makes studies like these different from ordinary research?
Let’s look at some of the general principles behind
ethnographic
research in business.
First of all, the researcher has to be completely open-minded – he or she hasn’t thought up a
hypothesis
to be tested, as is the case in other types of research.
Instead they wait for the participants in the research to inform them.
As far as choosing the participants themselves is concerned, that’s not really all that different from ordinary research – the
criteria
according to which the participants are chosen may be something as simple as the age bracket they fall into, or the researchers may select them according to their
income (Q37)
, or they might try to find a set of people who all use a
particular
product, for example.
But it’s absolutely
crucial
to
recruit
the right people as participants.
As well as the
criteria
I’ve mentioned, they have to be
comfortable (Q38)
talking about themselves and being watched as they go about their activities.
Actually, most researchers say that people open up pretty easily, maybe because they’re often in their own home or workplace.
So what makes this type of research special is that it’s not just a matter of sending a
questionnaire
to the participants, instead the research is usually based on first-hand
observation
(Q39)
of what they are doing at the time.
But that doesn’t mean that the researcher never talks to the participants.
However, unlike in traditional research, in this case it’s the participant rather than the researchers who decides what direction the interview will follow.
This means that there’s less likelihood of the researcher imposing his or her own ideas on the participant.
But after they’ve said goodbye to their participants and got back to their office, the researchers’ work isn’t finished.
Most researchers estimate that 70 to 80 per cent of their time is spent not on the collecting of data but on its
analysis (Q40)
– looking at photos, listening to recordings and transcribing them, and so on.
The researchers may end up with hundreds of pages of notes.
And to determine what’s significant, they don’t focus on the
sensational
things or the unusual things, instead they try to identify a pattern of some sort in all this data, and to discern the meaning behind it.
This can result in some
compelling
insights that can in turn feed back to the whole design process.

剑桥雅思14 test1 section2
雅思听力
原文
Good morning everyone. My name’s Janet Parker and I’m the human resources manager. We’re very happy to welcome you to your new apprenticeship. I hope that the next six months will be a positive and enjoyable experience for you.
I’d like to start with some general advice about being an apprentice. Most of you have very little or no experience of working for a big organisation and the first week or so may be quite challenging. There will be a lot of new information to take in but don’t worry too much about trying to remember everything. The important thing is to
check with someone if you’re not sure what to do (Q11)
– you’ll find your supervisor is very approachable and won’t mind explaining things or helping you out. You’re here to learn so make the most of that opportunity. You’ll be spending time in different departments during your first week so make an effort to
talk to as many people as possible (Q12)
about their work – you’ll make some new friends and find out lots of useful information.
As well as having a supervisor, you’ll each be assigned a mentor. This person will be someone who’s recently completed an apprenticeship and you’ll meet with them on a weekly basis. Their role is to provide help and support throughout your apprenticeship. Of course, this doesn’t mean they’ll actually do any of your work for you – instead they’ll be asking you about
what goals you’ve achieved so far (Q13)
, as well as helping you to
identify any areas for improvement. You can also
discuss your more long-term ambitions (Q14)
with them as well.
Now I just want to run through a few company policies for our apprenticeship scheme with you… Most importantly, the internet. As part of your job you’ll be doing some research online so obviously you’ll have unlimited access for that but please
don’t use it for personal use (Q15)
– you’ll have your own phones for that.
Some of you have already asked me about flexible working. After your probationary three – month period – some of you will be eligible for this – but i
t will depend on which department you’re in and what your personal circumstances are (Q16)
. So please don’t assume you’ll automatically be permitted to do this.
I want to make sure there’s no confusion about our holiday policy. Apart from any statutory public holidays
we ask that you don’t book any holidays until after your six-month apprenticeship has finished (Q17)
. Time off should only be taken if you are unwell. Please speak to your supervisor if this is going to be a problem.
You’ll be expected to work a 40-hour week but there may be opportunities to do overtime during busy periods. Although you’re not required to do this,
it can be a valuable experience – so we advise you to take it up if possible (Q18)
. Obviously, we understand that people do have commitments outside work, so don’t worry if there are times when you are unavailable.
As you know, we don’t have a formal dress code here – you may wear casual clothes as long as they’re practical – and the only restriction for shoes we have Is on high heels for health and safety reasons.
Comfortable shoes like trainers are preferable (Q19)
.
There’s a heavily subsidised canteen on site where you can get hot meals or salads cheaply. Snacks and drinks are also provided – so
we’ve decided to introduce a no packed lunch policy (Q20)
. This is partly to encourage healthy eating at work and partly to stop people from eating at their workstation, which is unhygienic.
OK moving on to …

剑桥雅思13Test1Section2听力答案解析 Traffic Changes in Granford
剑桥雅思13 test1 section2
雅思听力
原文
Good evening everyone. My name’s Phil Sutton, and I’m chairman of the Highways Committee. We’ve called this meeting to inform members of the public about the new regulations for traffic and parking we’re proposing for Granford. I’ll start by summarising these changes before we open the meeting to questions.
So, why do we need to make these changes to traffic systems in Granford? Well, we’re very aware that traffic is becoming an increasing problem. It’s been especially noticeable with the increase in heavy traffic while they’ve been building the new hospital.
But it’s the overall rise in the volume of traffic of all kinds that’s concerning us (Q11)
. To date there’s not been any increase in traffic accidents, but that’s not something we want to see happen, obviously.
We recently carried out a survey of local residents, and their responses were interesting.
People were very concerned about the lack of visibility on some roads due to cars parked along the sides of the roads (Q12)
. We’d expected complaints about the congestion near the school when parents are dropping off their children or picking them up, but this wasn’t top of the list, and nor were noise and fumes from trucks and lorries, though they were mentioned by some people.
We think these new traffic regulations would make a lot of difference. But we still have a long way to go. We’ve managed to keep our proposals within budget, just, so they can be covered by the Council.
But, of course, it’s no good introducing new regulations if we don’t have a wav of making sure that everyone obeys them (Q13)
, and that’s an area we’re still working on with the help of representatives from the police force.
OK, so this slide shows a map of the central area of Granford, with the High Street in the middle and School Road on the right. Now, we already have a set of traffic lights in the High Street at the junction with Station Road,
but we’re planning to have another set at the other end, at the School Road junction (Q14)
, to regulate the flow of traffic along the High Street.
We’ve decided we definitely need a pedestrian crossing. We considered putting this on School Road, just outside the school, but in the end we decided that could lead to a lot of traffic congestion
so we decided to locate it on the High Street, crossing the road in front of the supermarket (Q15)
. That’s a very busy area, so it should help things there.
We’re proposing some changes to parking.
At present, parking isn’t allowed on the High Street outside the library, but we’re going to change that, and allow parking there(Q16)
, but not at the other end of the High Street near School Road.
There’ll be a new ‘No Parking’ sign on School Road, just by the entrance to the school (Q17)
, forbidding parking for 25 metres. This should improve visibility for drivers and pedestrians, especially on the bend just to the north of the school.
As far as disabled drivers are concerned, at present they have parking outside the supermarket, but lorries also use those spaces, s
o we’ve got two new disabled parking spaces on the side road up towards the bank (Q18)
. It’s not ideal, but probably better than the present arrangement.
We also plan to widen the pavement on School Road.
We think we can manage to get an extra half-metre on the bend just before you get to the school, on the same side of the road (Q19)
.
Finally,
we’ve introduced new restrictions on loading and unloading for the supermarket, so lorries will only be allowed to stop there before 8 am. That’s the supermarket on School Road (Q20)
– we kept to the existing arrangements with the High Street supermarket.
OK. So that’s about it. Now, would anyone …

Hello everyone. My name’s Megan Baker and I’m a recruitment consultant at AVT Recruitment specialists
Now, our company specialises in positions that involve working in the agriculture and horticulture sectors, so that’s fresh food production, garden and park maintenance and so on. And these sectors do provide some very special career opportunities. For a start, they often offer
opportunities for those who don’t want to be stuck with a 40-hour week, but need to juggle work with other responsibilities (Q11)
such as child care – and this is very important for many of our recruits. Some people like working in a rural setting, surrounded by plants and trees instead of buildings, although we can’t guarantee that. But there are
certainly health benefits. especially in jobs where you’re not sitting all day looking at a screen (Q12)
– a big plus for many people. Salaries can sometimes be good too, although there’s a lot of variety here. And you may have the opportunity in some types of jobs for travel overseas, although that obviously depends on the job, and not everyone is keen to do it.
Of course, working outdoors does have its challenges. It’s fine in summer, but
can be extremely unpleasant when it’s cold and windy (Q13)
. You may need to be pretty fit for some jobs though with modern technology that’s not as important as it once was. And standards of health and safety are much higher now than they used to be, so there are fewer work-related accidents. But
if you like a lively city environment surrounded by lots of people, these jobs are probably not for you – they’re often in pretty remote areas (Q14)
. And some people worry about finding a suitable place to live, but in our experience, this usually turns out fine.
Now let me tell you about some of the exciting jobs that we have on our books right now.
One is for a fresh food commercial manager. Our client here is a very large fresh food producer supplying a range of top supermarkets. They operate in
a very fast-paced environment with low profit margins – the staff there work hard, but they play hard as well (Q15)
, so if you’ve a sociable personality this may be for you.
We have an exciting post as an agronomist advising farmers on issues such as crop nutrition, protection against pests, and the latest legislation on farming and agricultural practices. There are
good opportunities for the right person to quickly make their way up the career ladder (Q16)
, but a deep knowledge of the agricultural sector is expected of applicants.
A leading supermarket is looking for a fresh produce buyer who is available for a
12-month maternity cover contract (Q17)
. You need to have experience in administration, planning and buying in the fresh produce industry, and in return will receive a very competitive salary.
We have also received a request for
a sales manager for a chain of garden centres. You will be visiting centres in the region (Q18)
to ensure their high levels of customer service are maintained. This post is only suitable for someone who is prepared to live in the region.
There is also a vacancy for a tree technician to carry out tree cutting, forestry and conservation work. Candidates must have a clean driving licence and have training in safety procedures. A year’s experience would be preferred but
the company might be prepared to consider someone who has just completed an appropriate training course (Q19)
.
Finally, we have a position for a farm worker. This will involve a wide range of farm duties including crop sowing and harvesting, machine maintenance and animal care. Perks of the job include
the possibility of renting a small cottage on the estate (Q20)
, and the chance to earn a competitive salary. A driving licence and tractor driving experience are essential.

Hello everyone. I’m Jake Stevens and I’m your rep here at the hotel. I’m sure you’ll all have a great time here. So let me tell you a bit about what’s on offer. I’ll start by telling you about some of the excursions that are available for guests.
One thing you have to do while you’re here is go dolphin watching. On our boat trips, we pretty well guarantee you’ll see dolphins – if you don’t you can repeat the trip free of charge. We organise daily trips for just 35 euros. Unfortunately
there aren’t any places left for this afternoon’s trip (Q11)
, but come and see me to book for later in the week.
If you’re energetic, I’d recommend our forest walk. It’s a guided walk of about seven kilometres. There’ll be a stop half way, and
you’ll be provided with a drink and sandwiches (Q12)
. There’s some fairly steep climbs up the hills, so you need to be reasonably fit for this one, with good shoes, and bring a waterproof in case it rains. It’s just 25 euros all inclusive, and it’s every Wednesday.
Then on Thursdays we organise a cycle trip, which will give you all the fun of biking without the effort. We’ll take you and your bike up to the top of Mount Larna, and leave you to bike back –
it’s a 700-metre drop in just 20 kilometres (Q13)
so this isn’t really for inexperienced cyclists as you’ll be going pretty fast. And if it’s a clear day, you’ll have fantastic views.
On our local craft tour you can find out about the traditional activities in the island. And the best thing about this trip is that
it’s completely free (Q14)
. You’ll be taken to a factory where jewellery is made, and also a ceramics centre. If you want, you can buy some of the products but that’s entirely up to you. The trip starts after lunch on Thursday, and you’ll return by 6 pm.
If you’re interested in astronomy you may already know that the island’s one of the best places in the world to observe the night sky. We can offer trips to the observatory on Friday for those who are interested. They cost 90 euros per person and you’ll be shown the huge telescopes and have a talk from an expert, who’ll explain all about how they work.
Afterwards we’ll head down to Sunset Beach, where you can have a dip in the ocean (Q15)
if you want before we head off back to the hotel.
Finally, there’s horse riding. This is organised by the Equestrian Centre over near Playa Cortino and it’s a great experience if you’re a keen horseback rider, or
even if you’ve never been on a horse before (Q16)
. They take you down to the beach, and you can canter along the sand and through the waves. It costs 35 euros and it’s available every day.
So there’s plenty to do in the daytime, but what about night life?
Well, the number one attraction’s called ‘Musical Favourites, . Guests enjoy a three-course meal and unlimited free drinks, and watch a fantastic show, starting with musicals set in Paris and then crossing the Atlantic to Las Vegas and finally Copacabana. At the end the
cast members come down from the stage
, still in their stunning costumes, and
you’ll have a chance to chat with them (Q17)
. It’s hugely popular, so let me know now if you’re interested because
it’s no good leaving it until the last minute (Q18)
. It’s on Friday night. Tickets are just 50 euros each, but for an extra 10 euros you can have a table right by the stage.
If you’d like to go back in time, there’s the Castle Feast on Saturday evening. It’s held in a twelfth-century castle, and you eat in the great courtyard, with ladies in long gowns serving your food. You’re given a whole chicken each, which you eat in the medieval way,
using your hands instead of cutlery (Q19)
, and you’re entertained by competitions where the horseback riders attempt to knock one another off their horses. Then you can watch the dancers in the ballroom and
join in as well if you want (Q20)
. OK, so now if anyone …

That’s right. I’ve been looking at how a range of natural dyes can be used to colour fabrics like cotton and wool.
TUTOR:
Why did you choose that topic?
JIM:
Well, I got a lot of useful ideas from the museum, you know, at that exhibition of textiles. But I’ve always been interested in anything to do with colour.
Years ago, I went to a carpet shop with my parents when we were on holiday in Turkey, and I remember all the amazing colours (Q21)
.
TUTOR:
They might not all have been natural dyes.
JIM:
Maybe not, but for the project I decided to follow it up. And I found a great book about a botanic garden in California that specialises in plants used for dyes.
TUTOR:
OK. So, in your project, you had to include a practical investigation.
JIM:
Yeah. At first I couldn’t decide on my variables. I was going to just look at one type of fibre for example, like cotton …
TUTOR:
… and see how different types of dyes affected it?
JIM:
Yes.
Then I decided to include others as well, so I looked at cotton and wool and nylon (Q22)
.
TUTOR:
With just one type of dye?
JIM:
Various types, including some that weren’t natural, for comparison.
TUTOR:
OK.
JIM:
So, I did the experiments last week. I used some ready-made natural dyes, I found a website which supplied them, they came in just a few days, but I also made some of my own.
TUTOR:
That must have taken quite a bit of time.
JIM:
Yes, I’d thought it’d just be a matter of a teaspoon or so of dye, and actually that wasn’t the case at all.
Like I was using one vegetable, beetroot, for a red dye, and I had to chop up a whole pile of it (Q23)
. So it all took longer than I’d expected.
TUTOR:
One possibility is to use food colourings.
JIM:
I did use one. That was a yellow dye, an artificial one.
TUTOR:
Tartrazine?
JIM:
Yeah. I used it on cotton first. It came out a great colour,
but when I rinsed the material, the colour just washed away (Q24)
. I’d been going to try it out on nylon, but I abandoned that idea.
TUTOR:
Were you worried about health issues?
JIM:
I’d thought if it’s a legal food colouring, it must be safe.
TUTOR:
Well, it can occasionally cause allergic reactions, I believe.
TUTOR:
So what natural dyes did you look at?
JIM:
Well, one was turmeric. The colour’s great, it’s a really strong yellow. It’s generally used in dishes like curry.
TUTOR:
It’s meant to be quite good for your health when eaten, but you might find
it’s not permanent when it’s used as a dye – a few washes, and it’s gone (Q25)
.
JIM:
Right. I used beetroot as a dye for wool. When I chop up beetroot to eat I always end up with bright red hands,
but the wool ended up just a sort of watery cream shade (Q26)
. Disappointing.
TUTOR:
There’s a natural dye called Tyrian purple. Have you heard of that?
JIM:
Yes. It comes from a shellfish, and it was worn in ancient times but only by important people as
it was so rare. I didn’t use it.
TUTOR:
It fell out of use centuries ago (Q27)
. though one researcher managed to get hold of some recently. But that shade of purple can be produced by chemical dyes nowadays. Did you use any black dyes?
JIM:
Logwood. That was quite complicated. I had to prepare the fabric so the dye would take.
TUTOR:
I hope you were careful to wear gloves.
JIM:
Yes. I know the danger with that dye.
TUTOR:
Good.
It can be extremely dangerous if it’s ingested (Q28)
. Now, presumably you had a look at an insect-based dye? Like cochineal, for example?
JIM:
Yes. I didn’t actually make that, I didn’t have time to start crushing up insects to get the red colour and anyway they’re not available here, but I managed to get the dye quite easily from a website.
But it cost a fortune (Q29)
. I can see why it’s generally just used in cooking, and in small quantities.
TUTOR:
Yes, it’s very effective, but that’s precisely why it’s not used as a dye.
JIM:
I also read about using metal oxide. Apparently you can allow iron to rust while it’s in contact with the fabric, and that colours it.
TUTOR:
Yes, that works well for dying cotton. But you have to be careful as
the metal can actually affect the fabric (Q30)
and so you can’t expect to get a lot of wear out of fabrics treated in this way. And the colours are quite subtle, not everyone likes them. Anyway, it looks as if you’ve done a lot of work …

原文
LIZZIE:
So how are you getting on with your teaching practice at the High School, Joe?
JOE:
Well I’ve been put in charge of the school marching band, and it’s quite a responsibility. I’d like to talk it over with you.
LIZZIE:
Go ahead. You’d better start by giving me a bit of background.
JOE:
OK. Well the band has students in it from all years, so they’re aged 11 to 18, and there are about
50 (Q21)
of them altogether. It’s quite a popular activity within the school. I’ve never worked with a band of more than 20 before, and this is very different.
LIZZIE:
I can imagine.
JOE:
They aren’t really good enough to enter national band competitions, but they’re in a
regional (Q22)
one later in the term. Even if they don’t win, and I don’t expect them to, hopefully it’ll be an incentive for them to try and improve.
LIZZIE:
Yes, hopefully.
JOE:
Well, now the town council’s organising a
carnival (Q23)
in the summer, and the band has been asked to perform. If you ask me, they aren’t really up to it yet, and I need to get them functioning better as a band, and in a very short time.
LIZZIE:
Have you been doing anything with them? Apart from practising the music, I mean.
JOE:
I played a recording I came across, of a
drummer (Q24)
talking about how playing in a band had changed his life. I think it was an after-dinner speech. I thought it was pretty inspiring, because being in the band had stopped him from getting involved in crime. The students seemed to find it interesting, too.
LIZZIE:
That’s good.
JOE:
I’m planning to show them that old
film (Q25)
from the 1940s ‘Strike Up the Band’, and talk about it with the students. What do you think?
LIZZIE:
Good idea. As it’s about a school band, it might make the students realise how much they can achieve if they work together.
JOE:
That’s what I’ve got in mind. I’m hoping I can take some of the band to a
parade (Q26)
that’s going to take place next month. A couple of marching bands will be performing, and the atmosphere should be quite exciting. It depends on whether I can persuade the school to hire a coach or two to take us there.
LIZZIE:
Mmm. They sound like good ideas to me.
JOE:
Thanks.
JOE:
Can I tell you about a few people in the band who I’m finding it quite difficult to cope with? I’m sure you’ll have some ideas about what I can do.
LIZZIE:
Go ahead.
JOE:
There’s a flautist who says she loves playing in the band. We rehearse twice a week after school, but
she’s hardly ever there (Q27)
. Then she looks for me the next day and gives me a very plausible reason – she says she had to help her mother, or she’s been ill, but to be honest, I don’t believe her.
LIZZIE:
Oh dear! Any more students with difficulties?
JOE:
Plenty! There’s a trumpeter who thinks she’s the best musician in the band, though she certainly isn’t.
She’s always saying what she thinks other people should do (Q28)
, which makes my job pretty difficult.
LIZZIE:
She sounds a bit of a nightmare!
JOE:
You can say that again. One of the trombonists has got an impressive sense of rhythm, and could be an excellent musician – except that
he has breathing difficulties, and he doesn’t really have enough breath for the trombone (Q29)
. He’d be much better off playing percussion, for instance, but he refuses to give up. So he ends up only playing half the notes.
LIZZIE:
I suppose you have to admire his determination.
JOE:
Maybe. One of the percussionists isn’t too bad, but
he never seems to interact with other people, and he always rushes off as soon as the rehearsal ends (Q30)
. I don’t know if there are family reasons, or what. But it isn’t good in a band, where people really need to feel they’re part of a group.
LIZZIE:
Hmm.
JOE:
There are others too, but at least that gives you an idea of what I’m up against. Do you have any thoughts about what I can do, Lizzie?

原文
JAKE:
Hello, Junior Cycle camp, Jake speaking.
WOMEN:
Hi. I’m calling for some information about the cycle camp – I’m thinking of sending my son.
JAKE:
Great. Well, it’s held every weekday morning over the summer vacation and we focus on basic cycling skills and safety. We have eight levels for children from three years upwards. How old’s your son?
WOMEN:
Charlie? He’s seven. He can ride a bike, but he needs a little more training before he’s safe to go on the road.
JAKE:
He’d probably be best in Level 5. They start off practising on the site here, and we aim to get them riding on the road, but first they’re taken to ride in the
park (Q1)
, away from the traffic.
WOMEN:
Right. And can you tell me a bit about the instructors?
JAKE:
Well, all our staff wear different coloured shirts. So, we have three supervisors, and they have red shirts. They support the instructors, and they also stand in for me if I’m not around. Then the instructors themselves are in
blue (Q2)
shirts, and one of these is responsible for each class.
WOMEN:
OK.
JAKE:
In order to be accepted, all our instructors have to submit a
reference (Q3)
from someone who’s seen them work with children – like if they’ve worked as a babysitter, for example. Then they have to complete our training course, including how to do lesson plans, and generally care for the well-being of the kids in their class. They do a great job, I have to say.
WOMEN:
Right. And tell me a bit about the classes. What size will Charlie’s class be?
JAKE:
We have a limit of eight children in each class, so their instructor really gets to know them well. They’re out riding most of the time but they have quiet times too, where their instructor might tell them a
story (Q4)
that’s got something to do with cycling or get them to play a game together. It’s a lot of fun.
WOMEN:
It must be. Now, what happens if there’s
rain (Q5)
? Do the classes still run?
JAKE:
Oh yes. We don’t let that put us off – we just put on our waterproofs and keep cycling.
WOMEN:
And is there anything special Charlie should bring along with him?
JAKE:
Well, maybe some spare clothes, especially if the weather’s not so good. And a
snack (Q6)
for break time.
WOMEN:
How about a drink?
JAKE:
No, we’ll provide that. And make sure he has shoes, not sandals.
WOMEN:
Sure. And just at present Charlie has to take
medication (Q7)
every few hours, so I’ll make sure he has that.
JAKE:
Absolutely. Just give us details of when he has to take it and we’ll make sure he does.
WOMEN:
Thanks.
JAKE:
Now, there are a few things you should know about Day 1 of the camp. The classes normally start at 9.30 every morning, but on Day 1 you should aim to get Charlie here by 9.20. The finishing time will be 12.30 as usual. We need the additional time because there are a few extra things to do. . The most important is that we have a very careful check to make sure that every child’s
helmet (Q8)
fits properly. If it doesn’t fit, we’ll try to adjust it, or we’ll find him another one – but he must wear it all the time he’s on the bike.
WOMEN:
Of course.
JAKE:
Then after that, all the instructors will be waiting to meet their classes, and they’ll meet up in the
tent (Q9)
– you can’t miss it. And each instructor will take their class away and get started.
WOMEN:
OK. Well that all sounds good. Now can you tell me how much the camp costs a week?
JAKE:
One hundred ninety-nine dollars (Q10)
. We’ve managed to keep the price more or less the same as last year – it was one hundred ninety then. But the places are filling up quite quickly.
WOMEN:
Right. OK, well I’d like to book for …

剑桥雅思13 test1 section3
雅思听力
原文
EMMA:
We’ve got to choose a topic for our experiment, haven’t we, Jack? Were you thinking of something to do with seeds?
JACK:
That’s right. I thought we could look at seed germination – how a seed begins to grow.
EMMA:
OK. Any particular reason? I know you’re hoping to work in plant science eventually…
JACK:
Yeah, but practically everything we do is going to feed into that. No,
there’s an optional module on seed structure and function in the third year that I might do, so I thought it might be useful for that (Q21)
. If I choose that option, I don’t have to do a dissertation module.
EMMA:
Good idea.
JACK:
Well, I thought for this experiment we could look at the relationship between seed size and the way the seeds are planted. So, we could plant different sized seeds in different ways, and see which grow best.
EMMA:
OK.
We’d need to allow time for the seeds to come up.
JACK:
That should be fine if we start now. A lot of the other possible experiments need quite a bit longer (Q22)
.
EMMA:
So that’d make it a good one to choose. And I don’t suppose it’d need much equipment; we’re not doing chemical analysis or anything. Though that’s not really an issue, we’ve got plenty of equipment in the laboratory.
JACK:
Yeah. We need to have a word with the tutor if we’re going to go ahead with it though. I’m sure our aim’s OK. It’s not very ambitious but the assignment’s only ten percent of our final mark, isn’t it?
But we need to be sure we’re the only ones doing it (Q23)
.
EMMA:
Yeah, it’s only five percent actually, but it’d be a bit boring if everyone was doing it.
JACK:
Did you read that book on seed germination on our reading list?
EMMA:
The one by Graves? I looked through it for my last experiment, though it wasn’t all that relevant there. It would be for this experiment, though.
I found it quite hard to follow – lots about the theory, which I hadn’t expected (Q24)
.
JACK:
Yes, I’d been hoping for something more practical. It does include references to the recent findings on genetically-modified seeds, though.
EMMA:
Yes, that was interesting.
JACK:
I read an article about seed germination by Lee Hall.
EMMA:
About seeds that lie in the ground for ages and only germinate after a fire?
JACK:
That’s the one. I knew a bit about it already, but not about this research.
His analysis of figures comparing the times of the fires and the proportion of seeds that germinated was done in a lot of detail – very impressive (Q25)
.
EMMA:
Was that the article with the illustrations of early stages of plant development? They were very clear.
JACK:
I think those diagrams were in another article.
EMMA:
Anyway, shall we have a look at the procedure for our experiment? We’ll need to get going with it quite soon.
JACK:
Right. So the first thing we have to do is find our seeds. I think vegetable seeds would be best. And obviously they mustn’t all be the same size.
So how many sorts do we need? About four different ones (Q26)
?
EMMA:
I think that would be enough. There’ll be quite a large number of seeds for each one.
JACK:
Then, for each seed we need to find out how much it weighs (Q27)
, and also measure its dimensions, and we need to keep a careful record of all that.
EMMA:
That’ll be quite time-consuming.
And we also need to decide how deep we’re going to plant the seeds (Q28)
– right on the surface, a few millimetres down, or several centimetres.
JACK:
OK. So then we get planting.
Do you think we can plant several seeds together in the same plant pot?
EMMA:
No, I think we need a different one for each seed (Q29)
.
JACK:
Right. And we’ll need to label them – we can use different coloured labels. Then we wait for the seeds to germinate – I reckon that’ll be about three weeks, depending on what the weather’s like.
Then we see if our plants have come up. and write down how tall they’ve grown (Q30)
.
EMMA:
Then all we have to do is look at our numbers, and see if there’s any relation between them.
JACK:
That’s right. So …

TUTOR: First of all I’d just like to say, Cristina and Ibrahim, that I really enjoyed watching your video about student life last week, and I could see that the rest of the group did too. You did really well, and I hope that you got a lot out of it. I’d like to use this tutorial as a feedback session, where you reflect on the experience of doing the project. So Cristina, I was wondering, what did you enjoy most about making the video?
CRISTINA: I liked using the camera.
TUTOR: Is it the first time you’ve operated one like that?
CRISTINA: Yes, it is.
TUTOR: Well the results were very good! Anything else?
CRISTINA: I also enjoyed visiting one of the British students we filmed. I’d never been inside a British
home
before.
Q21
TUTOR: OK Cristina, thanks. What about you, Ibrahim? What did you enjoy?
IBRAHIM: Well for me it was a very good chance to get to know students who are on other courses, because everyone in our group is studying English, and we don’t usually have much to do with the rest of the college.
TUTOR: Yes, good. Do you think you’ll maintain the contact now?
IBRAHIM: I hope so. I’ve invited three of them to
have dinner
with me next week.
Q22
TUTOR: Great! If you haven’t decided what to make yet I can tell you they’ll love trying Arab dishes. And of course, it’s good for your English too. Cristina, what did you find? What was the most useful aspect of the project from the point of view of the English practice?
CRISTINA: I think, when we were being shown how to edit the film, we had to follow the instructions. And that was very good practice for me. And I also learned some
technical
words that I hadn’t heard before.
Q23
TUTOR: What about you Ibrahim? What was the most useful for your English?
IBRAHIM: It was listening to the British students, because they don’t speak as slowly as most of the tutors on our course. I think they speak at natural speed, so it forces me to get used to it. And they use a lot of
slang
.
Q24
TUTOR: So you learned some new words which will be useful?
IBRAHIM: Yes.
TUTOR: Good. I’m glad it helped. Well, we’ve talked a little bit about enjoyment, and about language practice. Were there any other benefits? What else did you feel you’d learnt from the project? Was it useful in other ways?
CRISTINA: Yes, well firstly, I learned how to use a video camera. And also, I think I really learned a lot about working together with other people. I’ve never done anything with a group before, and we had to find ways of
cooperating
, erm, and compromising, and sometimes
persuading
people, when they don’t agree with you.
Q25, Q26
TUTOR: Yes, that is a very useful experience, I know.
TUTOR: What about you, Ibrahim?
IBRAHIM: Well, I think I learnt a lot about how important
editing
is. When you’re filming you think that everything’s going to be interesting, but in fact we cut around half of it in the end, and then it was much better.
Q27
TUTOR: Good. Well, one last thing I’d like to ask. What mistakes do you think you, as a group that is, made? I mean, to put it another way, if you had to do it all over again, is there anything you’d do differently?
CRISTINA: We didn’t plan very well. For example, we didn’t decide on dates when we’d
complete
each separate step of the project, and we should have agreed about that in the beginning, because we were always late with everything!
Q28
TUTOR: Right. Anything else?
CRISTINA: I think we should have tried to
experiment
more with the camera. I mean with angles, and the focus and that kind of thing.
Q29
TUTOR: So you should have been more ambitious? Do you agree, Ibrahim?
IBRAHIM: Not really. In fact, I think we were too ambitious. We were inexperienced, and we didn’t have a lot of time, and we tried to do too much, to make a
long
film. Next time I would make a shorter one and try to get the quality better.
Q30
TUTOR: Well, that’s very interesting. Next semester we will be doing another video project – with a different content, of course – but you’ll have an opportunity to put into practice what you’ve learnt this time. Do you have any ideas about…

Good evening everyone and thank you for coming to the Soccer Club meeting. It’s good to see so many parents and children here tonight, and I know you are looking forward to a great football season. Now I’d like to take a few minutes to tell you about some changes to the Soccer Club for the coming season.
Now, this season we’ll be playing all our matches for both the junior and senior competitions at King’s Park, instead of Royal Park, which was used last season.
Now for meetings, we’re going to use the
clubhouse
in King’s Park, and the next meeting will be held in the clubhouse on the 2nd of July.
Q11
As usual, we hope to begin the season with a
picnic
next Saturday at the clubhouse. Please try and come to the picnic as it’s always good fun. The last week of the season we usually have a dinner and presentation of
prizes
to the players, and more information about this will be given to you later in the season.
Q12, Q13
This season we have more teams than ever. We hope to have
ten
teams, instead of five, in the junior competition and they will play on Saturday mornings, beginning at 8.30 a. m. Training sessions will be held in King’s Park on
Wednesday afternoons
for the juniors and they will be wearing red shirts again this year.
Q14, Q15
In the senior competition, there’ll be
four
teams, the same as last year, and their games will be played on Saturday afternoons starting at 2.30, no sorry, it will be a 2 o’clock start, and the training session for seniors is planned for
Sunday afternoons
.
Q16, Q17
Now I’d like to introduce you to the new committee for the Soccer Club for this season. Firstly, let me welcome Robert Young, the new President, who will manage the meetings for the next two years. Robert’s son has been playing football with the club for over five years now, and many thanks to Robert for taking on the job of President.
Next we have Gina Costello, she’s the treasurer, and she will
collect the fees
from you for the season. Please try and give Gina your fees as early as possible in the season, as the club needs the money to buy some new equipment.
Q18
Then there’s David West who has volunteered to be the club secretary, and one of the many jobs he will have is to
send out newsletters
to you regularly. If you have any information that may be useful, please let David know so that it can be included in these newsletters.
Q19
Also I’d like to introduce you to Jason Dokic who is the Head Coach. For all the new members here tonight, this is the third year that Jason has been with us as Head Coach, and we are very lucky to have such an experienced coach and former player at our club. He will continue to
supervise the teams

剑8 test 3 Section 4
雅思听力
原文
Good morning, everyone. In the last few lectures, I’ve been dealing with business finance, but now I’m going to move on to business systems. And in today’s lecture, I’m going to talk about what can go wrong when businesses try to copy their own best practices. Once a business has successfully introduced a new process – managing a branch bank, say, or selling a new product – the parent organisation naturally wants to repeat that success, and capture it if possible on a bigger scale. The goal, then, is to utilise existing knowledge and not to generate new knowledge. It’s a less glamorous activity than pure innovation, but
it actually happens more often (Q31)
, as a matter of fact. However, surprisingly, getting things right the second time is not necessarily any simpler than it was the first time. Now, there’s been a lot of research into how companies can repeat their previous successes, and it certainly hasn’t been confined to the United States. It seems that most large industries are trying to repeat their own successes, and manage the knowledge they’ve acquired – but even so, it has been shown that the overwhelming majority of attempts fail.
A host of studies confirm this, covering a wide range of business setting (Q32)
: branch banks, retail stores, real estate agencies, factories, call centres. . . to name but a few.
So why do so few managers get things right the second or third time? Let’s consider one reason for failure – placing too much trust in the people who are running the successful operation, the ‘experts’ shall we say. Managers who want to apply existing knowledge typically start off by going to an expert – such as the person who designed and is running a successful department store – and picking their brains.
Now, this approach can be used if you want to gain a rough understanding of a particular system, or understand smaller, isolated problems (Q33)
. The trouble is, even the expert doesn’t fully grasp the whole thing because when it comes to complex systems, the individual components of the process are interwoven with one another. The expert never has complete access to the necessary information. And the situation’s complicated even further by the fact that experts are usually not aware of their own ignorance. The ignorance can take various forms. For instance, a lot of details of the system are invisible to managers.
Some may be difficult to describe (Q34)
– learned on the job and well known by workers perhaps, but impossible to describe in a way that’s helpful. And there are some things that people know or do that they’re not even aware of.
Now, let’s consider two types of mistake that can occur when a manager actually starts to set up a duplicate system to replicate a successful process. Firstly, perhaps he forgets that he was just trying to copy another process, and starts trying to improve on it. Another mistake is trying to use the best parts of various different systems, in the hope of creating the perfect
combination (Q35)
.
Unfortunately, attempts like these usually turn out to be misguided and lead to problems. Why? Well, for various reasons. Perhaps there weren’t really any advantages after all, because the information wasn’t accurate. Or perhaps the business settings weren’t really comparable. More typically, the advantages are real enough, but there are also disadvantages that have been overlooked. For example, the modifications might compromise
safety (Q36)
in some way.
So, what’s the solution? Well, I don’t intend to suggest that it’s easy to get things right the second time. . . it’s not. But the underlying problem has more to do with attitudes than the actual difficulty of the task, and there are ways of getting it right. These involve adjusting
attitudes (Q37)
, first of all. . . being more realistic and cautious really. Secondly, they involve exerting strict
controls (Q38)
on the organisational and operational systems. And this, in turn, means copying the original as closely as possible. Not merely duplicating the physical characteristics of the
factory (Q39)
, but also duplicating the
skills (40)
that the original employees had. Reliance on a template like this offers the huge advantage of built-in consistency.

剑桥雅思13Test2Section3听力答案解析 Planning a presentation on nanotechnology
剑桥雅思13 test2 section3
雅思听力
原文
TUTOR:
Ah … come in, Russ.
RUSS:
Thank you.
TUTOR:
Now you wanted to consult me about your class presentation on nanotechnology – you’re due to give it in next week, aren’t you?
RUSS:
That’s right. And I’m really struggling. I chose the topic because I didn’t know much about it and wanted to learn more, but now I’ve read so much about it, in a way there’s too much to say -I could talk for much longer than the twenty minutes I’ve been allocated.
Should I assume the other students don’t know much, and give them a kind of general introduction, or should I try and make them share my fascination with a particular aspect (Q21)
?
TUTOR:
You could do either, but you’ll need to have it clear in your own mind.
RUSS:
Then I think I’ll give an overview.
TUTOR:
OK. Now, one way of approaching this is to work through developments in chronological order.
RUSS:
Uh-huh.
TUTOR:
On the other hand, you could talk about the numerous ways that nanotechnology is being applied.
RUSS:
You mean things like thin films on camera displays to make them water-repellent, and additives to make motorcycle helmets stronger and lighter.
TUTOR:
Exactly.
Or another way would be to focus on its impact in one particular area, say medicine, or space exploration (Q22)
.
RUSS:
That would make it easier to focus. Perhaps I should do that.
TUTOR:
I think that would be a good idea.
RUSS:
Right, How important is it to include slides in the presentation?
TUTOR:
They aren’t essential, by any means. And there’s a danger of tailoring what you say to fit whatever slides you can find.
While it can be good to include slides, you could end up spending too long looking for suitable ones. You might find it better to leave them out (Q23)
.
RUSS:
I see. Another thing I was wondering about was how to start. I know presentations often begin with ‘First I’m going to talk about this, and then I’ll talk about that’, but I thought about asking the audience what they know about nanotechnology.
TUTOR:
That would be fine if you had an hour or two for the presentation, but you might find that you can’t do anything with the answers you get, and it simply eats into the short time that’s available.
RUSS:
So,
maybe I should mention a particular way that nanotechnology is used, to focus people’s attention (Q24)
.
TUTOR:
That sounds sensible.
RUSS:
What do you think I should do next? I really have to plan the presentation today and tomorrow.
TUTOR:
Well, initially I think you should ignore all the notes you’ve made, take a small piece of paper, and
write a single short sentence that ties together the whole presentation (Q25)
: it can be something as simple as ‘Nanotechnology is already improving our lives’. Then start planning the content around that. You can always modify that sentence later, if you need to.
RUSS:
OK.
TUTOR:
OK, now let’s think about actually giving the presentation. You’ve only given one before, if I remember correctly, about an experiment you’d been involved in.
RUSS:
That’s right. It was pretty rubbish!
TUTOR:
Let’s say it was better in some respects than in others.
With regard to the structure. I felt that you ended rather abruptly, without rounding it off (Q26)
. Be careful not to do that in next week’s presentation.
RUSS:
OK.
TUTOR:
And
you made very little eve contact with the audience, because you were looking down at your notes most of the time. You need to be looking at the audience and only occasionally glancing at your notes (Q27)
.
RUSS:
Mmm.
TUTOR:
Your body language was a little odd. Every time you showed a slide, you turned your back on the audience so you could look at it – you should have been looking at your laptop. And you kept scratching your head, so
I found myself wondering when you were next going to do that, instead of listening to what you were saying (Q28)
!
RUSS:
Oh dear. What did you think of the language? I knew that not everyone was familiar with the subject, so I tried to make it as simple as I could.
TUTOR:
Yes, that came across.
You used a few words that are specific to the field, but you always explained what they meant, so the audience wouldn’t have had any difficulty understanding (Q29)
.
RUSS:
Uh-huh.
TUTOR:
I must say the handouts you prepared were well thought out. They were a good summary of your presentation (Q30)
, which people would be able to refer to later on. So well done on that.
RUSS:
Thank you.
TUTOR:
Well, I hope that helps you with next week’s presentation.
RUSS:
Yes, it will. Thanks a lot.
TUTOR:
I’ll look forward to seeing a big improvement, then.

剑桥雅思6Test4听力Section4答案解析 Asiatic lions
剑6 test 4 Section 4
雅思听力
原文
Well, most people think that lions only come from Africa. And you would be forgiven for thinking this, because in fact most lions do come from Africa. But this hasn’t always been the case. If we go back ten thousand years we would find that there were lions roaming vast sections of the globe. But now, unfortunately, only very small sections of the lions’ former habitat remain.
My particular interest is Asiatic lions, which are a sub-species of African lions.
It’s almost a hundred thousand years since the Asiatic lions split off and developed as a sub-species
.
Q31
At one time the Asiatic lion was living as far west as Greece and they were found from there, in a band that spread east through various countries of the Middle East, all the way to India. In museums, you can now see
Greek coins that have clear images of the Asiatic lion on them
. Most of them are dated at around 500 B.C.  However,
Europe saw its last Asiatic lion roaming free two thousand years ago
. Over the next nineteen hundred years the numbers of Asiatic lions in the other areas declined steadily, but it was only in the nineteenth century that they disappeared from everywhere but India.
Q32     Q33
So, how can you tell an Asiatic lion from an African lion, with which you’re probably more familiar? Well, in general, Asiatic lions are not as big as African lions. The colour is more or less the same, but the appearance of the mane is different – that’s the hair around the lion’s face and neck. The Asiatic lion’s mane is noticeably shorter than the African lion’s.
Asiatic lions also have a long fold of skin on their undersides, whereas not many African lions have this
.
Q34
Well, I’d like to talk to you now about the Gir Sanctuary in India. That’s where I’ve just come back from. The sanctuary was established specifically to protect the Asiatic lion. It’s
1,450
square kilometres in area and most of it is forest. There are now around three hundred Asiatic lions in India and almost all of them are in this sanctuary.
Q35
But despite living in a sanctuary, which makes them safe from hunters, they still face a number of problems that threaten their survival. One of these is the ever-present danger of
disease
. This is what killed more than a third of Africa’s Serengeti lions in 1994, and people are fearful that something similar could happen in the Gir Sanctuary and kill off many of the Asiatic lions there.
Q36
India’s lions are particularly vulnerable because they have a limited gene pool. The reason for this is interesting – it’s because all of them are descended from a few dozen lions that were saved by a
prince
who took a particular interest in them. He was very wealthy, and he managed to protect them – otherwise they’d probably have died out completely.
Q37
When you see the Asiatic lion in India, what you sense is enormous vitality. They’re very impressive beasts and you would never guess that they had this vulnerability when you look at them.
The Asiatic lions don’t have the Gir Sanctuary to themselves, I should add. They actually share it with about two thousand farmers. A significant proportion of the lions’
diet
is made up of the livestock of these farmers – goats, chickens and so on – as much as a third, in fact. And they’ve even been known to
attack humans
, especially in times of drought.
Q38    Q39
One final piece of interesting information – in ancient India one of the greatest tests of
leadership
for a man was to fight a lion. Now it seems, in modern India it will be a great test to see if the lion can be saved. I’m sure this is something that all of you will share concern for too.

剑桥雅思16Test3Part4听力答案解析 Hand knitting
剑桥雅思16 test3 Part4
雅思听力
原文
Good morning everyone. So today we’re going to look at an important creative activity and that’s hand knitting. Ancient knitted garments have been found in many different countries, showing that knitting is a global activity with a long history.
When someone says the word ‘knitting’ we might well picture an elderly person – a
grandmother (Q31)
perhaps-sitting by the fire knitting garments for themselves or other members of the family. It’s a homely image, but one that may lead you to feel that knitting is an activity of the past – and, indeed, during the previous
decade (Q32)
, it was one of the skills that was predicted to vanish from everyday life. For although humans have sewn and knitted their own clothing for a very long time, many of these craft-based skills went into decline when industrial machines took over – mainly because they were no longer passed down from one generation to another. However, that’s all changing and interest in knitting classes in many countries is actually rising, as more and more people are seeking formal instruction in the skill. With that trend, we’re also seeing an increase in the sales figures for knitting
equipment (Q33)
.
So why do people want to be taught to knit at a time when a machine can readily do the job for them? The answer is that knitting, as a handicraft, has numerous benefits for those doing it. Let’s consider what some of these might be. While many people knitted garments in the past because they couldn’t afford to buy clothes, it’s still true today that knitting can be helpful if you’re experiencing
economic (Q34)
hardship. If you have several children who all need warm winter clothes, knitting may save you a lot of money. And the results of knitting your own clothes can be very rewarding, even though the skills you need to get going are really quite
basic (Q35)
and the financial outlay is minimal.
But the more significant benefits in today’s world are to do with well-being. In a world where it’s estimated that we spend up to nine hours a day online, doing something with our hands that is craft-based makes us feel good. It releases us from the stress of a technological, fast-paced life.
Now, let’s look back a bit to early knitting activities. In fact, no one really knows when knitting first began, but archaeological remains have disclosed plenty of information for us to think about.
One of the interesting things about knitting is that the earliest pieces of clothing that have been found suggest that most of the items produced were
round (Q36)
rather than flat.  Discoveries from the 3rd and 4th centuries in Egypt show that things like socks and gloves, that were needed to keep hands and feet warm, were knitted in one piece using four or five needles. That’s very different from most knitting patterns today, which only require two. What’s more, the very first needles people used were hand carved out of wood and other natural materials, like
bone (Q37)
, whereas today’s needles are largely made of steel or plastic and make that characteristic clicking sound when someone’s using them. Ancient people knitted using yarns made from linen, hemp, cotton and wool, and these were often very
rough
(Q38)
on the skin. The spinning wheel, which allowed people to make finer yarns and produce much greater quantities of them, led to the dominance of wool in the knitting industry – often favoured for its warmth.
Another interesting fact about knitting is that because it was practised in so many parts of the world for so many purposes, regional differences in
style (Q39)
developed. This visual identity has allowed researchers to match bits of knitted clothing that have been unearthed over time to the region from which the wearer came or the job that he or she did.
As I’ve mentioned, knitting offered people from poor communities a way of making extra money while doing other tasks. For many centuries, it seems, men, women and children took every opportunity to knit, for example, while watching over
sheep (Q40)
, walking to market or riding in boats. So, let’s move on to take a…

剑桥雅思12 test6 section2
雅思听力
原文
Right. I’ve now almost succeeded in finalising plans for our tour, so I’ll bring you up to date with what I know
As you know, we’re flying first to Munich, on Monday the 4th.
The flight is at 11.30, so it’s too early to have lunch at the airport.
I suggest we meet there for coffee at
10 (Q11)
, which should give us plenty of time for breakfast before we leave home.
When we arrive in Munich, we’ll be met at the airport by Claus Bauer.
Claus works for a tour operator (Q12)
, and he’ll look after us for the time we’ll be in Germany.
He’s already liaised with the managers of the theatres we’re going to visit, and he’s also arranged for an officer of the National Theatre in Munich to show us round the theatre one afternoon during our stay.
Now last time we discussed this trip, I didn’t have the precise cost for hotel rooms, but now I have.
The normal rate at the hotel where we’re staying is 150 euros a night for a double room.
I’d hoped to get that down to 120 euros,
but in fact I’ve been able to negotiate a rate of 110 (Q13)
.
That’ll be reflected in the final payment which you’ll need to make by the end of this week.
On Tuesday, the day after our arrival, I had hoped we could sit in on a
rehearsal
at one of the theatres, but unfortunately that’s proved very difficult to arrange, so instead we’ll have a coach trip to one of the amazing castles in the mountains south of Munich.
On Tuesday evening, we’ll all have dinner together in a restaurant near our hotel.
From talking to you all about your preferences, it was clear that a typical local restaurant would be too meat-oriented for some of you.
Some of you suggested an Italian restaurant,
but I must confess that I decided to book a Lebanese one (Q14)
, as we have plenty of opportunities to go to an Italian restaurant at home.
On Wednesday afternoon, the director of the play we’re going to see that evening will talk to us at the theatre (Q15)
.
She’ll describe the whole process of producing a play, including how she chose the actors, and, as the play we’re going to see is a modern one, how she worked with the
playwright
.
Right. Now I’d just like to make a few points about the plays we’re going to see, partly because it might influence your choice of clothes to take with you!
The play we’re seeing on Wednesday evening is a modern one, and we’re going to the premiere (Q16)
, so it’ll be quite a dressy occasion, though of course you don’t have to dress formally.
I gather it’s rather a multimedia production, with amazing lighting effects and a soundtrack of electronic music, though unfortunately the
playwright
is ill and is unlikely to be able to attend.
On Thursday we’re seeing a play that was first performed last year, when it was commissioned to mark a hundred years since the birth in the town of a well-known scientist (Q17)
.
We’re going to see a
revival
of that production, which aroused a lot of interest.
Friday’s play will really make you think hard about what clothes to pack, as it’ll be in the garden of a palace (Q18)
.
It’s a beautiful setting, but I’d better warn you, there won’t be much protection from the wind.
On Saturday, we’re going by coach to a theatre in another town, not far from Munich.
This will be the opening of a drama festival, and the mayor and all the other dignitaries of the town will be attending (Q19)
.
After the performance, the mayor is hosting a reception for all the audience, and there’ll be a band playing traditional music of the region.
And after having a day off on Sunday,
our final play is on Monday, and it’s in the stunning setting of the old Town Hall, which dates back to the 14th century (Q20)
.
The performance marks the fifty years that the lead actor has been on stage, and the play is the one where he made his first professional appearance, all those years ago.
And the day after that, we’ll be flying back home.
Now have you got any questions before I…

雅思听力
原文
Hi everyone, welcome to the Snow Centre. My name’s Annie. I hope you enjoyed the bus trip from the airport – we’ve certainly got plenty of snow today! Well, you’ve come to New Zealand’s premier snow and ski centre, and we’ve a whole load of activities for you during your week here.
Most visitors come here for the cross-country skiing, where you’re on fairly flat ground for most of the time, rather than going down steep mountainsides.
There are marked trails, but you can also leave these and go off on your own and that’s an experience not to be missed (Q11)
. You can go at your own speed – it’s great aerobic exercise if you really push yourself, or if you prefer you can just glide gently along and enjoy the beautiful scenery.
This afternoon, you’ll be going on a dog-sled trip. You may have seen our dogs on TV recently racing in the winter sled festival.
If you want, you can have your own team for the afternoon and learn how to drive them (Q12)
, following behind our leader on the trail. Or if you’d prefer, you can just sit back in the sled and enjoy the ride as a passenger.
At the weekend, we have the team relay event, and you’re all welcome to join in. We have a local school coming along, and a lot of the teachers are taking part too. Participation rather than winning is the main focus, and
there’s a medal for everyone who takes part (Q13)
. Participants are in teams of two to four, and each team must complete four laps of the course.
For your final expedition, you’ll head off to Mount Frenner wearing a pair of special snow shoes which allow you to walk on top of the snow. This is an areawhere miners once searched for gold, though there are very few traces of their work left now. When the snow melts in summer, the mountain slopes are carpeted in flowers and plants.
It’s a long ascent. though not too steep, and walkers generally take a couple of days to get to the summit and return (Q14)
.
You’ll spend the night in our hut half-way up the mountain. That’s included in your package for the stay.
It’s got cooking facilities, firewood and water for drinking (Q15)
. For washing, we recommend you use melted snow, though, to conserve supplies. We can take your luggage up on our snowmobile for you for just ten dollars a person. The hut has cooking facilities so you can make a hot meal in the evening and morning, but you need to take your own food.
The weather on Mount Frenner can be very stormy.
In that case, stay in the hut – generally the storms don’t last long (Q16)
. Don’t stress about getting back here to the centre in time to catch the airport bus – they’ll probably not be running anyway. We do have an emergency locator beacon in the hut but only use that if it’s a real emergency, like if someone’s ill or injured.
Now, let me tell you something about the different ski trails you can follow during your stay here. Highland Trail’s directly accessible from where we are now.
This trail’s been designed to give first-timers an experience they’ll enjoy regardless of their age or skill, but it’s also ideal for experts to practise their technique (Q17)
.
Then there’s Pine Trail… if you’re nervous about skiing, leave this one to the experts! You follow a steep valley looking right down on the river below – scary!
But if you’ve fully mastered the techniques needed for hills, it’s great fun (Q18)
.
Stony Trail’s a good choice once you’ve got a general idea of the basics. There are one or two tricky sections, but nothing too challenging.
There’s a shelter half-way where you can sit and take a break and enjoy the afternoon sunshine (Q19)
.
And finally, Loser’s Trail. This starts off following a gentle river valley but the last part is quite exposed so the snow conditions can be challenging – if it’s snowing or windy,
check with us before you set out to make sure the trail’s open that day (Q20)
.
Right, so now if you’d like to follow me, we’ll get started …

原文
JULIE:
Hello?
GREG:
Oh, hello. Is that Julie Davison?
JULIE:
Yes.
GREG:
This is Greg Preston from the Employment Agency. We met last week when you came in to enquire about office work.
JULIE:
Oh, that’s right.
GREG:
Now we’ve just had some details come in of a job which might interest you.
JULIE:
OK.
GREG:
So this is a position for a
receptionist (Q1)
– I believe you’ve done that sort of work before?
JULIE:
Yes, I have, I worked in a sports centre for a couple of years before I got married and had the children.
GREG:
Right. Well, this job’s in Fordham, so not too far away for you, and it’s at the
medical (Q2)
centre there.
JULIE:
OK. So where exactly is that?
GREG:
It’s quite near the station, on Chastons Road.
JULIE:
Sorry?
GREG:
Chastons (Q3)
Road – that’s C-H-A-S-T-O-N-S.
JULIE:
OK, thanks. So what would the work involve? Dealing with enquiries from patients?
GREG:
Yes, and you’d also be involved in making
appointments (Q4)
, whether face to face or on the phone. And rescheduling them if necessary.
JULIE:
Fine, that shouldn’t be a problem.
GREG:
And another of your duties would be keeping the centre’s
database (Q5)
up-to-date. Then you might have other general administrative duties as well, but those would be the main ones.
JULIE:
OK.
GREG:
Now when the details came in, I immediately thought of you because one thing they do require is someone with
experience (Q6)
, and you did mention your work at the sports centre when you came in to see us.
JULIE:
Yes, in fact I enjoyed that job. Is there anything else they’re looking for?
GREG:
Well, they say it’s quite a high-pressure environment, they’re always very busy, and patients are often under stress, so they want someone who can cope with that and stay calm, and at the same time be
confident (Q7)
when interacting with the public.
JULIE:
Well, after dealing with three children all under five, I reckon I can cope with that.
GREG:
I’m sure you can.
GREG:
And then another thing they mention is that they’re looking for someone with good IT skills.
JULIE:
Not a problem.
GREG:
So you’d be interested in following this up?
JULIE:
Sure. When would it start?
GREG:
Well, they’re looking for someone from the beginning of next month, but I should tell you that this isn’t a permanent job, it’s
temporary (Q8)
, so the contract would be just to the end of September. But they do say that there could be further opportunities after that.
JULIE:
OK. And what would the hours be?
GREG:
Well, they want someone who can start at a quarter to eight in the morning – could you manage that?
JULIE:
Yes, my husband would have to get the kids up and off to my mother’s – she’s going to be looking after them while I’m at work. What time would I finish?
GREG:
One fifteen (Q9)
.
JULIE:
That should work out all right. I can pick the kids up on my way home, and then I’ll have the afternoon with them. Oh, one thing .. is there
parking (Q10)
available for staff at the centre?
GREG:
Yes, there is, and it’s also on a bus route.
JULIE:
Right. Well, I expect I’ll have the car but it’s good to know that.
GREG:
OK, so where do l go from here?
JULIE:
Well, if you’re happy for me to do so, I’ll forward your CV and references, and then the best thing would probably be for you to phone them so they can arrange for an interview.
GREG:
Great. Well thank you very much.
JULIE:
You’re welcome. Bye now.
GREG:
Bye.

雅思听力
原文
SUPERVISOR:
Hi, Joanna, good to meet you.
Now, before we discuss your new research project, I’d like to hear something about the
psychology
study you did last year for your Master’s degree.
So how did you choose your subjects for that?
JOANNA:
Well, I had six subjects, all professional musicians, and all female.
Three were violinists and there was also a cello player and a pianist and a flute player.
They were all very highly regarded in the music world and
they’d done quite
extensive
tours in different continents (Q21)
, and quite a few had won prizes and competitions as well.
SUPERVISOR:
And they were quite young, weren’t they?
JOANNA:
Yes, between 25 and 29 – the mean was 27. 8.
I wasn’t specifically looking for artists who’d produced recordings, but this is something that’s just taken for granted these days, and they all had (Q22)
.
SUPERVISOR:
Right.
Now you collected your data through telephone interviews, didn’t you?
JOANNA:
Yes.
I realised if I was going to interview leading musicians it’d only be possible over the phone because they’re so busy (Q23)
.
I recorded them using a telephone recording adaptor.
I’d been worried about the quality, but it worked out all right.
I managed at least a 30-minute interview with each subject, sometimes longer.
SUPERVISOR:
Did doing it on the phone make it more stressful?
JOANNA:
I’d thought it might …
it was all quite informal though and in fact they seemed very keen to talk.
And I don’t think using the phone meant I got less rich data, rather the opposite in fact (Q24)
.
SUPERVISOR:
Interesting.
And you were looking at how performers dress for concert performances?
JOANNA:
That’s right.
My research investigated the way players see their role as a musician and how this is linked to the type of clothing they decide to wear.
But that focus didn’t emerge immediately.
When I started I was more interested in trying to investigate the impact of what was
worn
on those listening (Q25)
, and also whether
someone like a violinist might adopt a different style of clothing from, say, someone playing the flute or the
trumpet (Q26)
.
SUPERVISOR:
It’s interesting that the choice of dress is up to the individual, isn’t it?
JOANNA:
Yes, you’d expect there to be rules about it in orchestras, but that’s quite rare.
SUPERVISOR:
You only had women performers in your study.
Was that because male musicians are less worried about fashion?
JOANNA:
I think a lot of the men are very much influenced by fashion, but
in social terms the choices they have are more limited …
they’d really upset audiences if they strayed away from quite narrow boundaries (Q27)
.
SUPERVISOR:
Hmm.
Now, popular music has quite different expectations.
Did you read Mike Frost’s article about the dress of women performers in popular music?
JOANNA:
No.
SUPERVISOR:
He points out that a lot of female singers and musicians in popular music tend to dress down in performances, and wear less
feminine
clothes, like jeans instead of skirts, and
he suggests this is because otherwise they’d just be discounted as trivial (Q28)
.
JOANNA:
But you could argue they’re just wearing what’s practical …
I mean, a pop-music concert is usually a pretty energetic affair.
SUPERVISOR:
Yes, he doesn’t make that point, but I think you’re probably right.
I was interested by the effect of the audience at a musical performance when it came to the choice of dress.
JOANNA:
The subjects I interviewed felt this was really important.
It’s all to do with what we understand by performance as a public event.
They believed the audience had certain expectations and it was up to them as performers to fulfil these expectations, to show a kind of esteem … (Q29)
SUPERVISOR:
…they weren’t afraid of looking as if they’d made an effort to look good.
JOANNA:
Mmm.
I think in the past the audience would have had those expectations of one another too, but that’s not really the case now, not in the UK anyway.
SUPERVISOR:
No.
JOANNA:
And I also got interested in what sports scientists are doing too, with regard to clothing.
SUPERVISOR:
Musicians are quite
vulnerable
physically, aren’t they, because the movements they carry out are very intensive and
repetitive
, so
I’d imagine some features of sports clothing could
safeguard
the players from the Potentially dangerous effects of this sort of thing (Q30)
.
JOANNA:
Yes, but musicians don’t really consider it.
They avoid clothing that obviously restricts their movements, but that’s as far as they go.
SUPERVISOR:
Anyway, coming back to your own research, do you have any idea where you’re going from here?
JOANNA:
I was thinking of doing a study using an audience, including …

剑桥雅思18 Test2 Part2
雅思听力
原文
Hello everyone. It’s good to see that so many members of the public have shown up for our presentation on the new housing development planned on the outskirts of Nunston. I’m Mark Reynolds and I’m Communications Manager at the development.
I’ll start by giving you a brief overview of our plans for the development. So one thing I’m sure you’ll want to know is why we’ve selected this particular site for a housing development. At present it’s being used for farming, like much of the land around Nunston. But because of the new industrial centre in Nunston,
there’s a lot of demand for housing for employees in
the region. as many employees are having to commute long distances at present (Q11)
. Of course, there’s also the fact that we have an international airport just 20 minutes’ drive away, but although that’s certainly convenient, it wasn’t one of our major criteria for choosing the site. We were more interested in the fact that
there’s an excellent hospital just 15 kilometres away and a large secondary school even closer than that (Q12)
. One drawback to the site is that it’s on quite a steep slope, but we’ve taken account of that in our planning so it shouldn’t be a major problem.
We’ve had a lot of positive feedback about the plans. People like the wide variety of accommodation types and prices, and the fact that it’s only a short drive to get out into the countryside from the development. We were particularly pleased that so many people liked the designs for the layout of the development, with the majority of people saying it generally made a good impression and
blended in well with the natural features of the landscape, with provision made for protecting trees and wildlife on the site (Q13)
. Some people have mentioned that they’d like to see more facilities for cyclists, and we’ll look at that, but the overall feedback has been that
the design and facilities of the development make it seem a place where people of all ages can live together happily (Q14)
.
OK. So I’ll put a map of the proposed development up on the screen. You’ll see it’s bounded on the south side by the main road, which then goes on to Nunston. Another boundary is formed by London Road, on the western side of the development. Inside the development there’ll be about 400 houses and 3 apartment blocks.
There’ll also be a school for children up to 11 years old. If you look at the South Entrance at the bottom of the map, there’s
a road from there that goes right up through the development. The school will be on that road, at the corner of the second turning to the left (Q15)
.
A large sports centre is planned with facilities for indoor and outdoor activities. This will be
on the western side of the development, just below the road that branches off from London Road (Q16)
.
There’ll be a clinic where residents can go if they have any health problems. Can you see the lake towards the top of the map?
The clinic will be just below this, to the right of a street of houses (Q17)
.
There’ll also be a community centre for people of all ages.
On the northeast side of the development, there’ll be a row of specially designed houses specifically for residents over 65 and the community centre will be adjoining this (Q18)
.
We haven’t forgotten about shopping. There’ll be
a supermarket between the two entrances to the development. We’re planning to leave the three large trees near London Road, and it’ll be just to the south of these (Q19)
.
It’s planned to have a playground for younger children. If you look at
the road that goes up from the South Entrance, you’ll see it curves round to the left at the top and the playground will be in that curve, with nice views of the lake (Q20)
.
OK, so now does anyone …

原文
TUTOR:
So now I want you to discuss the lesson we’ve just been watching on the video and think about the ways in which origami can be a useful educational tool. Can you all work with the person sitting next to you?
SEB:
I had no idea that such a simple thing like folding squares of paper to make the shape of something like a bird could be such an amazing tool. It’s made me see origami in a whole new light.
LIA:
I know. It was interesting to see the educational skills the children were developing by doing origami. On the video,
you could see them really listening hard to make sure they did all the steps in the right order to make the bird (Q21)
.
SEB:
That’s right. In this lesson they were working individually but it would also be interesting to see if the children could work out how to make something simple without being given any direction. That would help with building teamwork as well.
LIA:
Yes, but much more of a challenge. One thing that really stood out for me was that
the children were all having fun while being taught something new (Q22)
.
SEB:
Which is a key aim of any lesson with this age group. And although these kids had no problems with folding the paper, with younger children you could do origami to help practise fine motor skills.
LIA:
Absolutely. Shall we talk about the individual children we saw on the video? I wrote all their names down and took some notes.
SEB:
Yes, I did too.
LIA:
OK, good. Let’s start with Sid.
SEB:
He was interesting because before they started doing the origami, he was being quite disruptive.
LIA:
Yes. He really benefited from having to use his hands –
it helped him to settle down and start concentrating (Q23)
.
SEB:
Yes, I noticed that too. What about Jack? I noticed he seemed to want to work things out for himself.
LIA:
Mmm.
You could see him trying out different things rather than asking the teacher for help (Q24)
. What did you make of Naomi?
SEB:
She seemed to be losing interest at one point but then
she decided she wanted her mouse to be the best and that motivated her to try harder (Q25)
.
LIA:
She didn’t seem satisfied with hers in the end, though.
SEB:
No.
LIA:
Anya was such a star.
She listened so carefully and then produced the perfect bird with very little effort (Q26)
.
SEB:
Mmm – I think the teacher could have increased the level of difficulty for her.
LIA:
Maybe. I think it was the first time Zara had come across origami.
SEB:
She looked as if she didn’t really get what was going on.
LIA:
She seemed unsure about what she was supposed to do (Q27)
, but in the end hers didn’t turn out too badly.
SEB:
Yeah. I’m sure it was a positive learning experience for her.
LIA:
Mmm.
LIA:
I think one reason why the origami activity worked so well in this class was that the teacher was well-prepared.
SEB:
Right. I think it would have taken me ages to
prepare examples, showing each of the steps involved in making the bird (Q28)
. But that was a really good idea. The children could see what they were aiming for – and much better for them to be able to hold something, rather than just looking at pictures.
LIA:
Mmm – those physical examples supported her verbal explanations really well.
SEB:
It’s strange that origami isn’t used more widely. Why do you think that is?
LIA:
Well, teachers may just feel it’s not that appealing to children who are used to doing everything on computers, especially boys. Even if they’re aware of the benefits.
SEB:
Oh, I don’t know. It’s no different to any other craft activity.
I bet it’s because some teachers are clumsy like me (Q29)
.
LIA:
That’s true – too much effort required if you’re not good with your hands.
SEB:
Well, anyway, I think we should try it out in our maths teaching practice with Year 3. I can see using origami is a really engaging way of reinforcing children’s knowledge of geometric shapes, like they were doing in the video, but
I think it would also work really well for presenting fractions, which is coming up soon (Q30)
.
LIA:
Good idea – that’s something most of the kids in that class might struggle with. Origami would also be good practice for using symmetry – but I think they did that last term.
SEB:
OK – well let’s try and get some ideas together and plan the lesson next week.
TUTOR:
OK, if you could all stop…

原文
INTERVIEWER
: Today we’re pleased to have on the show Alice Bussell from the
Dolphin
Conservation Trust.
Tell us about the Trust, Alice.
ALICE
: Well, obviously its purpose is to protect dolphins in seas all around the world.
It tries to raise people’s awareness of the problems these marine creatures are suffering because of pollution and other threats.
It started ten years ago and it’s one of the fastest growing animal charities in the country—although it’s still fairly small compared with the big players in animal protection.
We are particularly proud of the work we do in education—last year we visited a huge number of schools in different parts of the country, going round to talk to children and young people aged from five to eighteen.
In fact, about thirty-five per cent of our members are children.
The charity uses its money to support campaigns—for example, for changes in fishing policy and so forth (Q11)
.
It hopes soon to be able to employ its first full-time biologist—with
dolphin
expertise—to monitor populations.
Of course, many people give their services on a voluntary basis and –
we now have volunteers working in
observation
, office work and other things (Q12)
.
I should also tell you about the award we won from the Charity Commission last year—for our work in education.
Although it’s not meant an enormous amount of money for us,
it has made our activities even more widely publicised and understood (Q13)
.
In the long term it may not bring in extra members but we’re hoping it’ll have this effect.
INTERVIEWER
: Is it possible to see dolphins in UK waters?
ALICE
: Yes.
In several locations.
And we have a big project in the east part of Scotland.
This has long been a haven for dolphins because it has very little shipping.
However, that may be about to change soon because oil companies want to increase exploration there.
We’re campaigning against this because, although there’ll be little pollution from oil,
exploration creates a lot of underwater noise (Q14)
.
It means the dolphins can’t rest and socialise.
This is how I became interested in
dolphin
conservation in the first place.
I had never seen one and I hadn’t been particularly interested in them at school.
Then I came across this story about a family of dolphins who had to leave their home in the Moray Firth because of the oil companies and about a child who campaigned to save them.
I couldn’t put the book down—I was hooked (Q15)
.
INTERVIEWER
: I’m sure our listeners will want to find out what they can do to help.
You mentioned the ‘Adopt a
Dolphin
‘
scheme
.
Can you tell us about that?
ALICE
: Of course!
People can choose one of our dolphins to
sponsor
.
They receive a picture of it and news updates.
I’d like to tell you about four which are currently being adopted by our members: Moondancer, Echo, Kiwi and Samson.
Unfortunately,
Echo is being rather
elusive
this year and hasn’t yet been sighted by our observers (Q16)
but we remain optimistic that he’ll be out there soon.
All the others have been out in force—Samson and Moondancer are often photographed together but
it is Kiwi who’s our real ‘character’ as she seems to love coming up close for the cameras (Q17)
and we’ve captured her on film hundreds of times.
They all have their own personalities— Moondancer is very elegant and curves out and into the water very smoothly,
whereas
Samson has a lot of energy (Q18)

You’d probably expect him to be the youngest—he’s not quite—that’s Kiwi—but
Samson’s the latest of our dolphins to be chosen for the

Kiwi makes a lot of noise so we can often pick her out straightaway.
Echo and Moondancer are noisy too, but
Moondancer’s easy to find because she has a particularly large
fin
on her back (Q20)

剑桥雅思16 Test2 Part2
雅思听力
原文
Good morning and thank you for coming here today. I’d like to bring you up to date with changes in the school that will affect your children.
As you know, the school buildings date from various times: some from the 1970s, some from the last five years, and of course Dartfield House is over a century old. It was commissioned by a businessman, Neville Richards, and intended as his family home, but he died before it was completed.
His heir chose to sell it to the local council, who turned it into offices (Q11)
. A later plan to convert it into a tourist information centre didn’t come about, through lack of money, and instead it formed the nucleus of this school when it opened 40 years ago
The school has grown as the local population has increased, and I can now give you some news about the lower school site, which is separated from the main site by a road. Planning permission has been granted for development of both sites. The lower school will move to new buildings that will be constructed on the main site.
Developers will construct houses on the existing lower school site (Q12)
. Work on the new school buildings should start within the next few months.
A more imminent change concerns the catering facilities and the canteen. The canteen is always very busy throughout the lunch period – in fact it’s often full to capacity, because a lot of our pupils like the food that’s on offer there. But there’s only one serving point, so
most pupils have to wait a considerable time to be served (Q13)
. This is obviously unsatisfactory, as they may have hardly finished their lunch before afternoon lessons start.
So we’ve had a new Food Hall built, and this will come into use next week. It’ll have several serving areas, and I’ll give you more details about those in a minute, but one thing we ask you to do, to help in the smooth running of the Food Hall, is to
discuss with your children each morning which type of food they want to eat that day (Q14)
, so they can go straight to the relevant serving point. There won’t be any junk food – everything on offer will be healthy – and there’s no change to the current system of paying for lunches by topping up your child’s electronic payment card online.
You may be wondering what will happen to the old canteen.
We’ll still have tables and chairs in there, and pupils can eat food from the Food Hall or lunch they’ve brought from home (Q15)
. Eventually we may use part of the canteen for storage, but first we’ll see how many pupils go in there at lunchtime
OK, back to the serving points in the Food Hall, which will all have side dishes, desserts and drinks on sale, as well as main courses.
One serving point we call
World Adventures. This will serve a different country’s cuisine each day (Q16)
, maybe Chinese one day and Lebanese the next. The menus will be planned for a week at a time, so pupils will know what’s going to be available the whole of that week.
Street Life is also international, with food from three particular cultures.
We’ll ask pupils to make suggestions (Q17)
, so perhaps sometimes there’ll be food from Thailand, Ethiopia and Mexico, and then one of them will be replaced by Jamaican food for a week or two.
The Speedy Italian serving point will
cater particularly for the many pupils who don’t eat meat or fish (Q18)
: they can be sure that all the food served there is suitable for them. There’ll be plenty of variety, so they shouldn’t get bored with the food.
OK, that’s all on the new Food Hall. Now after-school lessons. These are very popular with pupils, particularly swimming – in fact there’s a waiting list for lessons. Cycling is another favourite, and I’m delighted that dozens of pupils make use of the chance to learn to ride in off-road conditions. It means that more and more cycle to and from school every day. As you know, we have a well-equipped performance centre, and
we’re going to start drama classes (Q19)
in there, too. Pupils will be able to join in just for fun or work up to taking part in a play-we hope to put on at least one a year. We already teach a number of pupils to use the sound and lighting systems in the centre. And a former pupil has given a magnificent grand piano to the school, so
a few pupils will be able to learn at the school instead of going to the local college (Q20)
. as many of them do at the moment.

原文
ED:
Did you make notes while you were watching the performances of
Romeo and
Juliet
, Gemma?
GEMMA:
Yes, I did. I found it quite hard though. I kept getting too involved in the play.
ED:
Me too. I ended up not taking notes. I wrote down my impressions when I got home. Do you mind if I check a few things with you? In case I’ve missed anything. And I’ve also got some questions about our assignment.
GEMMA:
No, it’s good to talk things through. I may have missed things too.
ED:
OK great. So first of all, I’m not sure how much information we should include in our reviews.
GEMMA:
Right. Well, I don’t think we need to describe what happens. Especially as
Romeo and Juliet
is one of Shakespeare’s most well-known plays.
ED:
Yeah, everyone knows the story. In an essay we’d focus on the poetry and Shakespeare’s use of imagery etc., but that isn’t really relevant in a review. We’re supposed to focus on how effective this particular production is.
GEMMA:
Mmm. We should say what made it a success or a failure.
ED:
And part of that means talking about
the emotional impact the performance had on us (Q21)
. I think that’s important.
GEMMA:
Yes. And we should definitely mention
how well the director handled important
bits of the play – like when Romeo climbs onto Juliet’s balcony (Q22)
.
ED:
And
the fight between Mercutio and Tybalt (Q22)
.
GEMMA:
Yes. It would also be interesting to mention the theatre space how the director used it but I don’t think we’ll have space in 800 words.
ED:
No. OK. That all sounds quite straightforward.
ED:
So what about The Emporium Theatre’s production of the play?
GEMMA:
I thought some things worked really well but there were some problems too.
ED:
Yeah. What about the set, for example?
GEMMA:
I think
it was visually really stunning (Q23)
. I’d say that was probably the most memorable thing about this production.
ED:
You’re right.
The set design was really amazing (Q23)
, but actually I have seen similar ideas used in other productions.
GEMMA:
What about the lighting? Some of the scenes were so dimly lit it was quite hard to see.
ED:
I didn’t
dislike
it.
It helped to change the mood of the quieter scenes (Q24)
.
GEMMA:
That’s a good point.
ED:
What did you think of the costumes?
GEMMA:
I was a bit surprised by the contemporary dress (Q25)
, I must say.
ED:
Yeah – I think it worked well, but
I had assumed it would be more conventional (Q25)
.
GEMMA:
Me too. I liked the music at the beginning and I thought the musicians were brilliant, but
I thought they were wasted because the music didn’t have much
impact in Acts 2 and 3 (Q26)
.
ED:
Yes –
that was a shame (Q26)
.
GEMMA:
One problem with this production was that the actors didn’t deliver the lines that well.
They were speaking too fast (Q27)
.
ED:
It was a problem I agree, but I thought it was
because they weren’t speaking
loudly enough – especially at key points in the play (Q27)
.
GEMMA:
I actually didn’t have a problem with that.
ED:
It’s been an interesting experience watching different versions of
Romeo and
Juliet
, hasn’t it?
GEMMA:
Definitely. It’s made me realise how relevant the play still is.
ED:
Right. I mean a lot’s changed since Shakespeare’s time, but in many ways nothing’s changed.
There are always disagreements and tension between teenagers and their parents (Q28)
.
GEMMA:
Yes, that’s something all young people can relate to – more than the violence and the extreme emotions in the play.
ED:
How did you find watching it in translation?
GEMMA:
Really interesting. I expected to find it more challenging, but I could follow the story pretty well.
ED:
I stopped worrying about not being able to understand all the words and focused on the actors’ expressions.
The ending was pretty powerful (Q29)
.
GEMMA:
Yes.
That somehow intensified the emotion for me (Q29)
.
ED:
Did you know Shakespeare’s been translated into more languages than any other writer?
GEMMA:
What’s the reason for his international appeal, do you think?
ED:
I was reading that it’s because his plays are about basic themes that people everywhere are familiar with.
GEMMA:
Yeah, and
they can also be understood on different levels (Q30)
. The characters have such depth.
ED:
Right – which
allows directors to experiment and find new angles (Q30)
.
GEMMA:
That’s really important because …

原文
Good morning everyone.
My name’s Joy Parkins and I’m the restaurant manager.
And I understand that none of you’ve had any previous experience as kitchen assistants.
Well, you might be feeling a bit nervous now, but most of our kitchen assistants say they enjoy the work.
Ok, they might get shouted at sometimes, but it’s nothing personal,
and they’re pleased that they have so many different things to do (Q11)
, which means they never get bored.
And I’ll tell you straightaway that if you do well, we might think about moving you up and giving you some more responsibility.
Right, well, you’ve all shown up on time, which is excellent start.
Now I’m glad to see none of you have unsuitable footwear, so that’s good – you need to be careful as the floors can get very wet and
slippery
.
Those of you with long hair have got it well out of the way,
but some of you’ll need to remove your rings and bracelets (Q12)
– just put them somewhere safe for today, and remember to leave them at home tomorrow, as they can be a safety hazard.
Now it’s going to be a busy day for you all today – we don’t have any tables free for this evening, and only a few for lunch (Q13)
.
Fortunately we’ve got our Head Chef back-he was away on holiday all last week which meant the other chefs had extra work.
Now, I’ll tell you a bit more about the job in a minute but first, some general regulations.
For all of you, whatever your age, there’s some equipment you mustn’t use until you’ve been properly trained, like the waste disposal system for example, for health and safety reasons.
Then I think there are two of you here who are under 18 – that’s Emma and Jake, isn’t it?
Right, so for you two, the meat slicer is out of bounds (Q14)
.
And of course none of you are allowed to use the electric mixer until you’ve been shown how it works.
Now you may have heard that this can be a stressful job, and I have to say that can be true.
You’ll be working an eight-hour day for the first week, though you’ll have the chance to do overtime after that as well if you want to. B
ut however long the hours are, you’ll get a break in the middle.
What you will find is that you’re on your feet all day long, lifting and carrying, so if you’re not fit now you soon will be (Q15)
!
You’ll find you don’t have much chance to take it easy –
when someone tells you to do something you need to do it straightaway (Q16)
– but at least we do have a very efficient air conditioning system compared with some kitchens.
Now let me tell you about some of the people you need to know.
So as I said,
I’m Joy Parkins and I decide who does what during the day and how long they work for (Q17)
.
I’ll be trying to get you to work with as many different people in the kitchen as possible, so that you learn while you’re on the job.
One person whose name you must remember is
David Field.
If you injure yourself at all, even if it’s really minor, you must report to him and he’ll make sure the incident is recorded and you get the appropriate treatment (Q18)
.
He’s trained to give basic treatment to staff himself, or he’ll sent off somewhere else if necessary.
Then there’s Dexter Wills-he’s the person you need to see if you smash a plate or something like that (Q19)
.
Don’t just leave it and hope no one will notice – it’s really important to get things noted and replaced or there could be problems later.
And finally,
there’s Mike Smith.
He’s the member of staff who takes care of all the stores of perishables (Q20)
, so if you notice we’re getting low in
flour
or sugar or something, make sure you let him know so he can put in and order.
Ok, now the next thing…

剑桥雅思14Test1Section4听力答案解析 marine renewable energy (ocean energy)
剑桥雅思14 test1 section4
雅思听力
原文
Producing enough energy to meet our needs has become a serious problem. Demand is rising rapidly, because of the world’s increasing population and expanding
industry (Q31)
. Burning fossil fuels, like gas, coal and oil, seriously damages the environment and they’ll eventually run out. For a number of years now, scientists have been working out how we can derive energy from renewable sources, such as the sun and wind, without causing pollution. Today I’ll outline marine renewable energy – also called ocean energy – which harnesses the movement of the oceans.
Marine renewable energy can be divided into three main categories: wave energy, tidal energy and ocean thermal energy conversion, and I’ll say a few words about each one.
First, wave energy. Numerous devices have been invented to harvest wave energy, with names such as Wave Dragon, the Penguin and Mighty Whale, and research is going on to try and come up with a really efficient method. This form of energy has plenty of potential, as the source is
constant (Q32)
, and there’s no danger of waves coming to a standstill. Electricity can be generated using onshore systems, using a reservoir, or offshore systems. But the problem with ocean waves is that they’re erratic, with the wind making them travel in every
direction (Q33)
. This adds to the difficulty of creating efficient technology: ideally all the waves would travel smoothly and regularly along the same straight line. Another drawback is that sand and other sediment on the ocean
floor (Q34)
might be stopped from flowing normally, which can lead to environmental problems.
The second category of marine energy that I’ll mention is tidal energy. One major advantage of using the tide, rather than waves, as a source of energy is that it’s
predictable (Q35)
: we know the exact times of high and low tides for years to come.
For tidal energy to be effective, the difference between high and low tides needs to be at least five metres, and this occurs naturally in only about forty places on Earth. But the right conditions can be created by constructing a tidal lagoon, an area of sea water separated from the sea.
One current plan is to create a tidal lagoon on the coast of Wales. This will be an area of water within a
bay (Q36)
at Swansea, sheltered by a U-shaped breakwater, or dam, built out from the coast. The breakwater will contain sixteen hydro turbines, and as the tide rises, water rushes through the breakwater, activating the turbines, which turn a generator to produce electricity. Then, for three hours as the tide goes out, the water is held back within the breakwater, increasing the difference in water level, until it’s several metres higher within the lagoon than in the open sea. Then, in order to release the stored water,
gates (Q37)
in the breakwater are opened. It pours powerfully out of the lagoon, driving the turbines in the breakwater in the opposite direction and again generating thousands of megawatts of electricity. As there are two high tides a day, this lagoon scheme would generate electricity four times a day, every day, for a total of around 14 hours in every 24 – and enough electricity for over 150,000 homes.
This system has quite a lot in its favour: unlike solar and wind energy it doesn’t depend on the weather; the turbines are operated without the need for
fuel (Q38)
, so it doesn’t create any greenhouse gas emissions; and very little maintenance is needed. It’s estimated that electricity generated in this way will be relatively cheap, and that manufacturing the components would create more than 2,000
jobs (Q39)
, a big boost to the local economy.
On the other hand, there are fears that lagoons might harm both fish and birds, for example by disturbing
migration (Q40)
patterns, and causing a build-up of silt, affecting local ecosystems.
There are other forms of tidal energy, but I’ll go on to the third category of marine energy: ocean thermal energy conversion. This depends on there being a big difference in temperature between surface water and the water a couple of kilometres below the surface, and this occurs in tropical coastal areas. The idea is to bring cold water up to the surface using a submerged pipe. The concept dates back to 1881, when …

PAM
: Hi Jun. As you know, I’ve asked you here today to discuss the future of our Self-Access Centre. We have to decide what we want to do about this very important resource for our English language students. So, can you tell me what the students think about this?
JUN:
Well, from the students’ point of view, we would like to keep it. The majority of students say that they enjoy using it because it provides a variation on the classroom routine and
they see it as a pretty major component of their course (Q21)
, but we would like to see some improvements to the equipment, particularly the computers; there aren’t enough for one each at the moment and we always have to share.
PAM:
Well yes, the teachers agree that it is a very valuable resource but one thing we have noticed is that a lot of the students are using it to check their personal emails. We don’t want to stop you students using it, but we think the computers should be used as a learning resource, not for emails.
Some of us also think that we could benefit a lot more by relocating the Self-Access Centre to the main University library building (Q22)
. How do you think the students would feel about that, Jun?
JUN:
Well, the library is big enough to incorporate the Self-Access Centre, but it wouldn’t be like a class activity anymore.
Our main worry would be not being able to go to a teacher for advice (Q23)
. I’m sure there would be plenty of things to do but we really need teachers to help us choose the best activities.
PAM:
Well, there would still be a teacher present and he or she would guide the activities of the students, we wouldn’t just leave them to get on with it.
JUN:
Yes, but I think the students would be much happier keeping the existing set-up; they really like going to the Self-Access Centre with their teacher and staying together as a group to do activities. If we could just improve the resources and facilities, I think it would be fine. Is the cost going to be a problem?
PAM:
It’s not so much the expense that I’m worried about, and we’ve certainly got room to do it, but
it’s the problem of timetabling a teacher to be in
there outside class hours (Q24)
. If we’re going to spend a lot of money on equipment and resources, we really need to make sure that everything is looked after properly. Anyway, let’s make some notes to see just what needs doing to improve the Centre.
PAM:
Now, what about the computers? I think it might be a good idea to install some new models. They would take up a lot less room and so that would increase the workspace for textbooks and so on.
JUN:
That would be great. It is a bit cramped in there at times.
PAM:
What about other resources? Do you have a list of things that the students would like to see improved?
JUN:
Yes, one of the comments that students frequently make is that they find it difficult to find materials that are appropriate for their level, especially
reading
(Q25)
resources, so I think we need to label them more clearly.
PAM:
Well that’s easy enough, we can get that organised very quickly. In fact, I think we should review all of the study resources as some of them are looking a bit out-of-date.
JUN:
Definitely. The
CD (Q26)
section especially needs to be more current. I think we should get some of the ones that go with our latest course books and also make multiple copies.
PAM:
Good, now I was also thinking about some different materials that we haven’t got in there at all. What do you think of the idea of introducing some
workbooks (Q27)
? If we break them up into separate pages and laminate them, they’d be a great resource. The students could study the main coursebook in class and then do follow-up practice in the Self-Access Centre.
JUN:
That sounds good.
PAM:
Okay, now finally we need to think about how the room is used. I’ll have to talk to the teachers and make sure we can all reach some agreement on a
timetable (Q28)
to supervise the centre after class. But we also need to think about security, too. Especially if we’re going to invest in some new equipment.
JUN:
What about putting in an
alarm (Q29)
?
PAM:
Good idea. The other thing I’d like to do is talk to our technicians and see whether we could somehow limit the access to
email (Q30)
. I really don’t want to see that resource misused.
JUN:
What about if we agree to only use it before and after class?
RAM:
Yes, that would be fine. OK, anyway … that’s great for now. We’ll discuss it further when we’ve managed to …

MAN: As I said earlier, there is I think at Rexford an excellent combination of physical and geographical advantages – as well as having a rural setting and still being close to central London, something that will certainly be of interest to you is that
Rexford is just 35 minutes from London Airport
. At Rexford, we have a strong research capability. We came 7th out of 101 universities in last year’s research assessment, carried out by a government body and did particularly well in your particular subjects, engineering, and science. Actually we got a top research grade of five for engineering, geography and computer sciences. One further point – and I know from talking to you individually that a number of you may be looking for some experience in the industry after the course – is that all our science and engineering research departments have unusually
close relationships with industry in the area
. Anyway, that’s enough sales talk from me… I’ll just take a sip of this coffee that’s just arrived, thank you, and then I’ll say something about what actually happens when you apply.
Q11/Q12
Right… Now if you do decide to make an application, what you do is send it directly to me in my department. I will then immediately send confirmation and the application process begins. Er… I’d like to say at this point that you shouldn’t worry if this process doesn’t work all that quickly  I mean occasionally there are postal problems, but most often the hold-up is caused by
references
– the people you give as referees, shall we say, take their time to reply. Anyway, it’s absolutely normal for this process to take three to four months. What I do in this period is keep in touch with you and reassure you that things are moving along.
Q13
One of the ways we’ve devised to help you decide about applying as well as later when you’ve been accepted… hopefully… is to put you in contact with, if possible, a student from your own
country
who is at present studying with us. What you can do is phone them up – we will, of course, liaise between you – and discuss your concerns with them. That way you can get an objective opinion of what you can expect if you come to live and study at Rexford – not only the academic atmosphere but important details like what the leisure facilities are like and whether the English
weather
and food are really as awful as everybody says!
Q14/Q15
If you decide you can face it, the contact can also help you just before you leave, with tips on what to pack and that sort of thing. At the moment I think we’ve got two second-year students and one postgraduate from this country.
Now to move on to the other concerns you expressed earlier. At a UK university – as I’m sure you know – you will be in an environment where
independent learning is the norm
, which takes most students a while to adjust to, and at a time when you will be separated from your normal surroundings and, in most cases, your family. This can be a difficult time. But remember that something like 25% of our student body are international students like yourselves, and that there are several organisations in the university and city whose main purpose is to offer help and ensure that your time with us is enjoyable and useful.
Q16
One or two of you touched on the subject of accommodation earlier. So I’ll just add a few points: it is the University’s policy to give priority in the allocation of residence places to three categories, and those are: visiting students, exchange students and
new postgraduate students
. However, demand exceeds supply, so there is still a need to put your name down early for campus accommodation, particularly if your family is accompanying you. This means that the earlier you decide whether you want to study with us… and so get the procedure moving, the better it will be for everybody. Yes?
Q17
WOMAN: What if you would prefer to live outside the university?
MAN: If you’re planning to live off-campus, you’ve got to sort things out even earlier. As with everything in short supply, the good accommodation gets snapped up months before the beginning of term – in other words,
if you’re starting in October you need to be thinking about it in June or at the very latest July
. So you do need to think very carefully about what you need, how much you can afford to pay, well in advance. What you can’t do is leave it until a few days before the start of term. The agencies in town are pretty good – it’s just a matter of contacting them in good time. Of course, we have a full-time accommodation officer available to help all students. She’ll get in touch with you when you’re accepted – she’s got plenty of contacts in the town and
will deal with the agencies on your behalf
.
Q18/Q19
One or two of you asked me earlier about your level of spoken English. Obviously most of you have already achieved a lot – I wish I could speak your language half as well. Having said that though, I’m afraid the lecturers will make little or no allowance for the presence of non-native speakers in the audience. So anything you can do to improve your spoken English – even beyond the pretty high levels most of you have already reached – will help make your stay with us that bit more fun for you.
Some extra practice before you arrive is worth more
than.., for example, private lessons afterwards, when you won’t really have time. Oh… and one last thing before I invite further questions: it’s very important that you…

剑桥雅思12
test6 Section4
雅思听力
原文
Over the years, attitudes towards workers have changed
considerably
.
After all, there was a time when workers had no rights at all, and laboured in
appalling
conditions.
Conditions have improved a lot, but conflict in the workplace is still common.
And human resources managers nowadays need to be able to deal with it when necessary.
What is conflict in the workplace?
Definitions vary, but I’m taking it to refer to a whole range of behaviours that the victim finds unacceptable, from minor, harmless arguments to – at the opposite extreme – physical violence.
Much of this is covered by the term
bullying (Q31)
, by which I mean one or more people behaving abusively or aggressively against another who is in a weaker position.
Although all behaviour like this is a form of conflict, not all conflict can be described in these terms.
As with all human behaviour, there are numerous reasons for it.
But often it’s caused by someone who feels the need to show their
superiority
(Q32)
over someone else, in order to feel that they aren’t at the lowest level in a
hierarchy
or a group of people.
In some cases one person simply dislikes the other, on the basis that the
personality
(Q33)
of one is in some way incompatible with that of the other person.
A general
habit
of optimism in one person could make them
intolerant
of a colleague who’s constantly
pessimistic
– not that that justifies treating them badly, of course.
Some conflicts arise when people are more interested in promoting themselves and their team than in the company as a whole.
These conflicts are called
‘
structural
‘
(Q34)
, and could come about, for example, when a sales team believe they are the only people in the business who do any useful work, and look down on behind-the-scenes administrators.
Conflict obviously affects the individuals concerned – the situation is likely to be very stressful for victims, resulting in their
absence
(Q35)
from work, possibly for months.
For the company, if no effort is made to deal with conflict, it can
spiral
out of control, and even lead to the breakdown of the business.
Some interesting work with chief executives – CEOs – has uncovered some of the reasons why they may treat colleagues badly.
Many CEOs combine two opposing characteristics:
confidence
(Q36)
– that is, the belief that they’re capable of great achievements – with a high level of anxiety, a fear of missing targets, whether set by themselves or by the directors of the company.
This combination can make them respond badly to anyone who questions their decisions.
In a high pressure work environment, such characteristics become problematic.
And it’s particularly difficult to
tackle
the situation where colleagues, managers and board members are all trying to achieve their own
visions
(Q37)
.
When they can’t agree on strategic issues and on where they see the business going, there are real problems.
For managers at lower levels within the organisation, it might seem that an
autocratic
form of management – where the chief
executive
gives orders and everyone else has to obey – would see more conflict than others.
Interestingly, though, a company with a more
democratic
(Q38)
business model, can suffer more, when uncertainty about who to report to leads to conflicting demands.
Now I’ll say a little about dealing with the type of conflict that has harmful effects.
Of course the ideal is to prevent it arising in the first place.
A good manager, at any level, will make efforts to earn the
respect
(Q39)
of the people they work with, particularly those who report to them.
That will involve politeness in all communications, and treating them as equals who happen to have a different role within the organisation.
Sometimes, of course, conflict does occur, and can get out of hand.
In such cases the human resources department often gets involved.
However, if one of the parties in a conflict sees human resources as simply a mouthpiece for the chief
executive
, then an external
mediator
(Q40)
might be able to help.
By talking to both sides, and trying to find the truth of what’s been happening, they can build a clear picture of the situation, and give feedback that both sides will accept, precisely because they’re independent.

剑桥雅思13Test4Section4听力答案解析 The history of coffee
剑桥雅思13 test4 section4
雅思听力
原文
In my presentation, I’m going to talk about coffee, and its importance both in economic and social terms. We think it was first drunk in the Arab world, but there’s hardly any documentary evidence of it before the 1500s, although of course that doesn’t mean that people didn’t know about it before then.
However, there is evidence that coffee was originally gathered from bushes growing wild in Ethiopia, in the northeast of Africa. In the early sixteenth century, it was being bought by traders, and gradually its use as a drink spread throughout the Middle East. It’s also known that in 1522, in the Turkish city of Constantinople, which was the centre of the Ottoman Empire, the court physician approved its use as a medicine.
By the mid-1500s, coffee bushes were being cultivated in the Yemen and for the next hundred years this region produced most of the coffee drunk in Africa and the Arab world.
What’s particularly interesting about coffee is its effect on social life. It was rarely drunk at home, but instead people went to coffee houses to drink it. These people, usually men, would meet to drink coffee and chat about issues of the day. But at the time, this chance to share ideas and opinions was seen as something that was potentially dangerous, and in 1623 the ruler of Constantinople demanded the
destruction (Q31)
of all the coffee houses in the city. although after his death many new ones opened, and coffee consumption continued. In the seventeenth century, coffee drinking spread to Europe, and here too coffee shops became places where ordinary people, nearly always men, could meet to exchange ideas. Because of this, some people said that these places performed a similar function to
universities (Q32)
. The opportunity they provided for people to meet together outside their own homes and to discuss the topics of the day had an enormous impact on social life, and many social movements and
political (Q33)
developments had their origins in coffee house discussions.
In the late 1600s, the Yemeni monopoly on coffee production broke down and coffee production started to spread around the world, helped by European colonisation. Europeans set up coffee plantations in Indonesia and the Caribbean and production of coffee in the colonies skyrocketed. Different types of coffee were produced in different areas, and it’s interesting that the names given to these different types, like Mocha or Java coffee, were often taken from the
port (Q34)
they were shipped to Europe from. But if you look at the labour system in the different colonies, there were some significant differences.
In Brazil and the various Caribbean colonies, coffee was grown in huge plantations and the workers there were almost all
slaves (Q35)
. But this wasn’t the same in all colonies; for example in Java, which had been colonised by the Dutch, the peasants grew coffee and passed a proportion of this on to the Dutch, so it was used as a means of
taxation (Q36)
. But whatever system was used, under the European powers of the eighteenth century, coffee production was very closely linked to colonisation. Coffee was grown in ever-increasing quantities to satisfy the growing demand from Europe, and it became nearly as important as
sugar (Q37)
production, which was grown under very similar conditions. However, coffee prices were not yet low enough for people to drink it regularly at home, so most coffee consumption still took place in public coffee houses and it still remained something of a luxury item. In Britain, however, a new drink was introduced from China, and started to become popular, gradually taking over from coffee, although at first it was so expensive that only the upper classes could afford it. This was
tea (Q38)
, and by the late 1700s it was being widely drunk. However, when the USA gained independence from Britain in 1776. they identified this drink with Britain, and coffee remained the preferred drink in the USA, as it still is today.
So, by the early nineteenth century, coffee was already being widely produced and consumed. But during this century, production boomed and coffee prices started to fall. This was partly because new types of
transportation (Q39)
had been developed which were cheaper and more efficient. So now, working people could afford to buy coffee – it wasn’t just a drink for the middle classes. And this was at a time when large parts of Europe were starting to work in industries. And sometimes this meant their work didn’t stop when it got dark: they might have to continue throughout the
night (Q40)
. So, the use of coffee as a stimulant became important – it wasn’t just a drink people drank in the morning, for breakfast.
There were also changes in cultivation ……

We’re very grateful that the Committee has agreed that a representative for the Students’ Union can present students’ suggestions about the design for the proposed new Union building. We appreciate that some of our ideas may not be feasible in the circumstances, but we do feel that it is important that the ultimate beneficiaries of the facilities should have some say in its design.
If I could start by briefly explaining what steps were taken to find out student opinion and how we have arrived at conclusions. Firstly, a meeting was held in the current Union for our SU Committee to explain the options. Then we invited all students to submit written suggestions for the design, placing cards in a suggestion box. These suggestions then provided the basis for the design of a
questionnaire
,  which was completed by
approximately two thousand
of the College students over a period of three weeks. Finally, the SU Committee collated the results and drew up a report. If I can just hand around a copy of that report. This presentation is essentially a summary and discussion of the key points of this report.
Q31, Q32
So, in broad terms, the consensus was as follows. Firstly, regarding the crucial matter of the site, we presented the three options that you have proposed. One: in the city center, near the Faculty of
Education
: two: on the outskirts of the city, near the park, and three: out of town, near the
halls of residence
. We asked students to cite reasons for and against these sites and, and there was remarkable agreement on all three. Site One was unpopular
because of traffic and parking problems
. Site Two had a number of supporters, mainly because it was close to
most lecture rooms
. And Site Three, out of town, near the halls of residence, was clearly the most popular because of access from living quarters. It was clear that the Union was mainly to be used after lectures. It was also felt that the larger site would allow
more room for a choice of facilities
.
Q33 Q34 Q35 Q36 Q37
Our second area of interest was obviously the facilities: there was minimal interest in having a library on the premises, but one option seemed to be a reading room instead -more useful. We would like the current table games room to be replaced with
a small gym
. And, if possible, a small swimming pool – not, of course, Olympic-sized! There was a large number of respondents in favor of
a travel agent’s
and insurance center. We also request that there be the offices of the Student Counselling Centre, moving this from the Refectory. There was, however, much disagreement about whether to build a drama theatre. Just over forty percent of the respondents were in favor, but a largish minority were strongly against it, claiming that it is
elitist and a waste of funds
. Essentially the jury is out on that.
Q38 Q39
Finally, given the number of unfortunate incidents in the current Union over the past few months, a strong point was repeatedly made about security. The recommendations would be at least
video surveillance
and security personnel who would
check Student Union cards on request
. We doubt if it would be feasible to have a check at the reception of all people coming in.
Q40
Well, this is the summary of the views of the student population. As I say, fuller details are given in our report but I’m happy to take any questions if you have them… (fade out)

Welcome to Green Vale Agricultural Park. As you know, we have only been open a week so you are amongst our first visitors. We have lots of fascinating indoor and outdoor exhibits on our huge complex, spreading hundreds of hectares. Our remit is
to give educational opportunities to the wider public as well as to offer research sites for a wide variety of agriculturists and other scientists
. (
Q11
)
Let’s start by seeing what there is to do. As you can see here on our giant wall plan, we are now situated in the Reception block. . . here. As you walk out of the main door into the park there is a path you can follow. If you follow this route you will immediately come into the Rare Breeds section, where we keep a wide variety of animals which I shall be telling you a little more about later. Next to this. . . moving east. . . is the large grazing area for the rare breeds. Then further east. . . in the largest section of our Park is the
Forest
(
Q12
)
Area. South of the grazing area and in fact just next to the Reception block is our Experimental Crop Area. In the middle of the Park. . . this circular area is our lake  These two small rectangular shapes here, are the
Fish Farms
(
Q13
)where we rear fish for sale. To the east of those is the marsh area which attracts a great many migrant birds. In the south-eastern corner, beyond the marsh, is our
Market Garden
(
Q14
) area, growing vegetables and flowers.
All these areas can be visited by the general public for almost all the year. . . although. . . please take note of the large signs at the entrance to each area which tell. . . which tell you when certain areas are being used for particular controlled experiments and are therefore
temporarily out of bounds
(
Q15
) to the public.
You can see for yourself what a huge area the park covers and a key question is always, how can we move around? Well you have a choice of means. . . all environmentally friendly. . . cars are banned in the park. We have
bicycles
which you can hire behind the Reception block. . . here. . . the healthy ones of you can
go on foot and finally there’s our electric tram, powered from solar cells
(
Q16
). You find more information about this at the front entrance.
A good place to start on your tour is the Rare Breeds section.
We keep goats, sheep and hens and other kinds of poultry
(
Q17
). We are also thinking of bringing in cows and horses but we do not, as yet, have facilities for these bigger animals. The animals are fed in public twice a day and a short lecture given on their feeding habits and nutritional needs. These are very popular with the public but of course we mustn’t lose sight of the main purpose of having this section, not as such to preserve rare animals but
to maintain the diversity of breeds
(
Q18
) to broaden the gene pool for agricultural development. Green Vale changes with the seasons with different events happening at different times of the year. May will be perhaps our most spectacular month with the arrival of the Canada geese and when our fruit trees will be in full blossom, but there are interesting events on all year round, for example, John Havers,
our expert fly fisherman, is currently giving displays
(
Q19
)on the lake. Each of the sections has its own seasonal calendar. . . please consult the summary board at the main entrance. And the final section, as we return to the Reception blocks, is the orchard.
Do take time to browse around our shop. . . there is a wide selection of
books on wildlife
(
Q20
), some of them written by local authors, and the history of farming, including organic farming, something which the park will be diversifying into in the coming months.

剑7 test 3 Section 2
雅思听力
原文
Good morning. I’m very pleased to have been invited along to your club to talk about our Charity Sponsored Walking Holiday for Education Aid. I’ll start by giving you a brief overview of what it entails. First of all, let me explain what we mean by ‘sponsored’ here. This is where people promise to donate money to the charity if you achieve your goal, in this case, to walk a certain number of miles.
Basically we are organizing a ten-day holiday, from the sixth to the sixteenth of November, with
eight days actual walking
, trekking in the Semira Mountains.
Q11
Let’s have a look at some of the details. We require you to raise sponsorship money of at least $3,200, paying $250 of it upfront as a deposit and the rest in stages throughout the year. Out of this about thirty-five percent will go on your expenses, and that leaves
sixty-five percent
guaranteed to go to the charity.
Q12
Which brings me to the most important part. This trek is being specifically organized to help education in the Semira region. Last year we helped train teachers for the disabled, and this year we’re focusing on the pupils.
Each of the walkers’ sponsorship money will go to help an individual special needs pupil
in one of the mountain schools. In the second part of the talk I’ll be giving you a lot more details, but back to the basic information.
Q13
Age limits. This is the second time we have run this kind of holiday and um, on the first we even had an eighty-year old, but we found it was wise to establish limits this time. You have to be at least eighteen and the top limit is now seventy, though you need to obtain a health certificate from your doctor if you are over sixty years old.
Now, the Semira Mountains are among the highest in the world but you mustn’t be too daunted, we will mainly be trekking in the foothills only, although there will be spectacular views even in the foothills. However,
you will need to be extremely fit
if you aren’t now and you’re interested in coming with us. You have plenty of time to get into shape. You will be sleeping in tents so you must have quite a bit of equipment with you but you will be helped by local assistants. Your bedding and so forth will be carried by them. We ask that you
only walk with a small rucksack with needs for the day
.
Q14 Q15
I don’t think I’ve really said enough about the marvelous area you’ll be walking in. Let’s have a look at some of the sights you’ll be seeing. Apart from these spectacular snow-covered peaks and valleys, there are marvelous historic villages. The area has been famous for centuries
for making beautiful carpets
, although recently there has been a trend to move into weaving blankets and wood carving. The people are extremely friendly and welcoming. We deliberately keep the parties small in size to minimize disruption to people and landscape.
Q16
I hope that there are still some people interested. I will be distributing leaflets at the end where you can find out more information, but just for the moment I’ll outline the itinerary, the main high points of the holiday. Obviously, you’ll start by flying out to Kishba, the capital city, on Day One. After a couple of days to acclimatize yourself, you’ll start the trek on Day Three
walking through the enormous Katiba Forest
which will take the whole of the day. Day Four takes us higher up, going through the foothills past a number of villages and visiting a school for the disabled in Sohan. Then you have a rest day, that’s Day Five, before
going to the spectacular Kumi Temple
with twelfth-century carvings, set in a small forest by a lake and that’s Day Six, the highlight for many. We stay near there for Day Seven because then comes the hardest day, walking through very mountainous country, but culminating in a
swim in the Parteh Falls. This is the highest waterfall
in the region. Day Nine is much easier, with part of the day spent
in a village
where they make some of the gorgeous red blankets. Then back down to Kishba and the journey home.
Q17 Q18 Q19 Q20
So you can see it’s a pretty packed timetable…

CARL:
Hi, come and take a seat.
JULIE:
Thank you.
CARL:
My name’s Carl Rogers and I’m one of the doctors here at the Total Health Clinic. So I understand this is your first visit to the clinic?
JULIE:
Yes, it is.
CARL:
OK, well I hope you’ll be very happy with the service you receive here. So if it’s alright with you I’ll take a few details to help me give you the best possible service.
JULIE:
Sure.
CARL:
So can I check first of all that we have the correct personal details for you? So your full name is Julie Anne Garcia?    Example
JULIE:
That’s correct.
CARL:
Perfect. And can I have a contact phone number?
JULIE:
It’s
219 442 9785 (Q1)
.
CARL:
OK, and then can I just check that we have the correct date of birth?
JULIE:
October tenth (Q3)
. 1992.
CARL:
Oh, I actually have 1991, I’ll just correct that now. Right, so that’s all good. Now I just need just a few more personal details … do you have an occupation, either full-time or part-time?
JULIE:
Yes, I work full-time in Esterhazy’s – you know, the restaurant chain. I started off as a waitress there a few years ago and I’m a
manager (Q3)
now.
CARL:
Oh I know them, yeah, they’re down on 114th Street, aren’t they?
JULIE:
That’s right.
CARL:
Yeah, I’ve been there a few times. I just love their salads.
JULIE:
That’s good to hear.
CARL:
Right, so one more thing I need to know before we talk about why you’re here, Julie, and that’s the name of your insurance company.
JULIE:
It’s Cawley Life Insurance, that’s
C-A-W-L-E-Y (Q4)
.
CARL:
Excellent, thank you so much.
CARL:
Now Julie, let’s look at how we can help you. So tell me a little about what brought you here today.
JULIE:
Well, I’ve been getting a pain in my
knee (Q5)
, the left one. Not very serious at first, but it’s gotten worse, so I thought I ought to see someone about it.
CARL:
That’s certainly the right decision. So how long have you been aware of this pain? Is it just a few days, or is it longer than that?
JULIE:
Longer. It’s been worse for the last couple of days, but it’s
three weeks (Q6)
since I first noticed it. It came on quite gradually though, so I kind of ignored it at first.
CARL:
And have you taken any medication yourself, or treated it in anyway?
JULIE:
Yeah, I’ve been taking medication to deal with the pain, Tylenol, and that works OK for a few hours. But I don’t like to keep taking it.
CARL:
OK. And what about heat treatment? Have you tried applying heat at all?
JULIE:
No, but I have been using ice on it for the last few days.
CARL:
And does that seem to help the pain at all?
JULIE:
A little, yes.
CARL:
Good. Now you look as if you’re quite fit normally?
JULIE:
I am, yes.
CARL:
So do you do any sport on a regular basis?
JULIE:
Yes, I play a lot of
tennis (Q7)
. I belong to a club so I go there a lot. I’m quite competitive so I enjoy that side of it as well as the exercise. But I haven’t gone since this started.
CARL:
Sure. And do you do any other types of exercise?
JULIE:
Yeah, I sometimes do a little swimming, but usually just when I’m on vacation. But normally I go
running (Q8)
a few times a week, maybe three or four times.
CARL:
Hmm. So your legs are getting quite a pounding. But you haven’t had any problems up to now?
JULIE:
No, not with my legs. I did have an accident last year when I slipped and hurt my
shoulder (Q9)
, but that’s better now.
CARL:
Excellent. And do you have any allergies?
JULIE:
No, none that I’m aware of.
CARL:
And do you take any medication on a regular basis?
JULIE:
Well, I take
vitamins (Q10)
cbut that’s all. I’m generally very healthy.
CARL:
OK, well let’s have a closer look and see what might be causing this problem. If you can just get up …

MARTHA:
Hi Alex. It’s Martha Clines here. James White gave me your number. I hope you don’t mind me calling you.
ALEX:
Of course not. How are you, Martha?
MARTHA:
Good thanks. I’m ringing because I need a bit of advice.
ALEX:
Oh yeah. What about?
MARTHA:
The training you did at JPNW a few years ago. I’m applying for the same thing.
ALEX:
Oh right. Yes, I did mine in 2014. Best thing I ever did. I’m still working there. Example
MARTHA:
Really? What are you doing?
ALEX:
Well, now I work in the customer services department but I did my initial training in
Finance (Q1)
. I stayed there for the first two years and then moved to where I am now.
MARTHA:
That’s the same department I’m applying for. Did you enjoy it?
ALEX:
I was pretty nervous to begin with. I didn’t do well in my exams at school and I was really worried because I failed
Maths (Q2)
. But it didn’t actually matter because I did lots of courses on the job.
MARTHA:
Did you get a diploma at the end of your trainee period? I’m hoping to do the one in
business (Q3)
skills.
ALEX:
Yes. That sounds good. I took the one on IT skills but I wish I’d done that one instead.
MARTHA:
OK, that’s good to know. What about the other trainees? How did you get on with them?
ALEX:
There were about 20 of us who started at the same time and we were all around the same age -I was 18 and there was only one person younger than me. who was
17 (Q4)
. The rest were between 18 and 20. I made some good friends.
MARTHA:
I’ve heard lots of good things about the training at JPNW. It seems like there are a lot of opportunities there.
ALEX:
Yeah, definitely. Because of its size you can work in loads of different areas within the organisation.
MARTHA:
What about pay? I know you get a lower minimum wage than regular employees.
ALEX:
That’s right – which isn’t great. But you get the same number of days’
holiday (Q5)
as everyone else. And the pay goes up massively if they offer you a job at the end of the training period.
MARTHA:
Yeah, but I’m not doing it for the money – it’s the experience I think will be really useful. Everyone says by the end of the year you gain so much confidence.
ALEX:
You’re right. That’s the most useful part about it. There’s a lot of variety too. You’re given lots of different things to do. I enjoyed it all – I didn’t even mind the studying.
MARTHA:
Do you have to spend any time in
college (Q6)
?
ALEX:
Yes, one day each month. So you get lots of support from both your tutor and your manager.
MARTHA:
That’s good. And the company is easy to get to, isn’t it?
ALEX:
Yes, it’s very close to the train station so the
location’s (Q7)
a real advantage.
ALEX:
Have you got a date for your interview yet?
MARTHA:
Yes, it’s on the 23rd of this month.
ALEX:
So long as you’re well prepared there’s nothing to worry about. Everyone’s very friendly.
MARTHA:
I am not sure what I should wear. What do you think?
ALEX:
Nothing too casual – like
jeans (Q8)
, for example. If you’ve got a nice jacket, wear that with a skirt or trousers.
MARTHA:
OK. Thanks. Any other tips?
ALEX:
Erm, well I know it’s really obvious but arrive in plenty of time. They hate people who are
late (Q9)
. So make sure you know exactly where you have to get to. And one other useful piece of advice my manager told me before I had the interview for this job – is to
smile (Q10)
. Even if you feel terrified. It makes people respond better to you.
MARTHA:
I’ll have to practise doing that in the mirror!
ALEX:
Yeah – well, good luck. Let me know if you need any more information.
MARTHA:
Thanks very much.

剑桥雅思12 test8 section3
雅思听力
原文
KATIE:
Joe, you know I’m giving a presentation in our film studies class next week?
JOE:
Yes.
KATIE:
Well, could we discuss it?
I could do with getting someone else’s opinion.
JOE:
Of course, Katie. What are you going to talk about?
KATIE:
It’s about film adaptations of Shakespeare’s plays.
I’ve got very interested in all the different approaches that film directors take.
JOE:
Uhuh.
KATIE:
So I thought I’d start with Giannetti, who’s a professor of film and literature.
And in one of his books he came up with a
straightforward
classification (Q21)
of film adaptations based on how faithful they are to the original plays and novels.
JOE:
Right.
KATIE:
I’ve already made some notes on that, so I just need to sort those out before the presentation.
I thought that next I’d ask the class to come up with the
worst (Q22)
examples of Shakespeare adaptations that they’ve seen, and to say why.
That should be more fun than having their favourite versions.
JOE:
Yes, I can certainly think of a couple!
KATIE:
Right. Next I want to talk about Rachel Malchow.
I came across something on the internet about her work on film adaptations, and I was thinking of showing some film clips to illustrate her ideas.
JOE:
Will you have enough time, though? Both to prepare and during the presentation?
After all, I doubt if you’ll be able to find all the clips you want.
KATIE:
Hmm. Perhaps you’re right.
OK, well, I’d better do some
slides (Q23)
instead, saying how various films relate to what she says.
That should encourage discussion.
JOE:
Mmm.
KATIE:
Next I want to say something about how plays may be chosen for
adaptation
because they’re concerned with
issues (Q24)
of the time when the film is made.
JOE:
You mean things like
patriotism
, or the role of governments?
KATIE:
Exactly. It’s quite tricky, but I’ve got a few ideas I’d like to discuss.
KATIE:
And finally I want to talk about a few adaptations that I think illustrate a range of approaches, and make some comments on them.
Do you know the Japanese film Ran?
JOE:
I haven’t seen it. It was based on Shakespeare’s King Lear, wasn’t it?
KATIE:
That’s right.
It was a very loose
adaptation
, using the same situation and story, but moving it to 16th century Japan instead of 16th century Britain (Q25)
.
So for example the king’s daughters become sons, because in Japanese culture at that time, women couldn’t succeed to the throne.
JOE:
OK. I hope you’re going to talk about the 1993 film of Much Ado About Nothing.
I think that’s one of the best Shakespeare films.
It really brings the play to life, doesn’t it?
KATIE:
Yes, I agree.
And I think filming it in Italy, where the play is set, makes you see what life was like at the time of the play (Q26)
.
JOE:
Absolutely. Right, what’s next?
KATIE:
Er, next.
I thought Romeo & Juliet, the 1996 film, which moves the action into the present day (Q27)
.
JOE:
Yes, it worked really well, I thought — changing the two feuding families in the original to two competing business empires, even though they’re speaking in the English of the original play.
KATIE:
You’d expect it would sound really
bizarre
, but I found I soon got used to it.
JOE:
Me too.
KATIE:
Then I thought I’d include a real Hollywood film, one that’s intended to appeal to a mass commercial audience.
JOE:
There must be quite a number of those.
KATIE:
Yes，
but I’ve picked the 1996 film of
Hamlet
.
It included every line of the text，but it’s more like a typical action hero movie (Q28)
— there are loads of special effects, but no unifying
interpretation
of the play.
JOE:
All show and no
substance
.
KATIE:
Exactly.
Then there’s Prospero’s Books, based on The Tempest.
That was really
innovative
, from a stylistic point of view
.
JOE:
Didn’t it include dance and singing and
animation
as well as live actors
(Q29)
.?
KATIE:
Yes, it did. I also want to mention Looking for Richard.
Did you ever see it?
JOE:
No. But I’ve read about it.
It was a blend of a
documentary
with a few scenes from Richard III, wasn’t it (Q30)
?
KATIE:
That’s right. It’s more a way of looking into how people nowadays connect with the
playwright
— the play is really just the starting point.
And that’ll be where I finish.
JOE:
Well, it sounds as though it’ll be very interesting.

剑桥雅思12Test7Section3听力答案解析 a tourism case study and the Horton Castle site
剑桥雅思12 test7 section3
雅思听力
原文
NATALIE:
Dave, I’m worried about our case study.
I’ve done a bit of reading, but I’m not sure what’s involved in actually writing a case study — I missed the lecture where Dr Baker talked us through it.
DAVE:
OK, well it’s quite
straightforward
.
We’ve got our focus – that’s tourism at the Horton Castle site.
And you said you’d done some reading about it.
NATALIE:
Yes, I found some articles and made notes of the main points.
DAVE:
Did you remember to keep a record of where you got the information from (Q21)
?
NATALIE:
Sure. I know what a pain it is when you forget that.
DAVE:
OK. so we can compare what we’ve read.
Then we have to decide on a
particular
problem or need at our site.
And then think about who we’re going to interview to get more information.
NATALIE:
OK. So who’d that be?
The people who work there (Q22)
?
And
presumably
some of the tourists too?
DAVE:
Yes, both those groups.
So we’ll have to go to the sites to do that, I suppose.
But we might also do some of our interviewing away from the sites –
we could even contact some people here in the city, like administrators involved in overseeing tourism (Q23)
.
NATALIE:
OK. So we’ll need to think about our interview questions and fix times and places for the meetings.
It’s all going to take a lot of time.
DAVE:
Mmm. And if we can, we should ask our interviewees if they can bring along some
numerical
data that we can add to support our findings.
NATALIE:
And photographs?
DAVE:
I think we have plenty of those already.
But Dr Baker also said we have to establish with our interviewees whether we can identify them in our case study, or whether they want to be
anonymous (Q24)
.
NATALIE:
Oh, I wouldn’t have thought of that.
OK, once we’ve got all this information, I suppose we have to analyse it.
DAVE:
Yes, put it all together and choose what’s relevant to the problem we’re focusing on, and
analyse that carefully to find out if we can identify any trends or regularities there (Q25)
.
That’s the main thing at this stage, rather than concentrating on details or lots of facts.
NATALIE:
OK. And then once we’ve analysed that, what next?
DAVE:
Well, then we need to think about what we do with the data we’ve selected to make it as clear as possible to our readers.
Things like graphs, or tables, or charts…
NATALIE:
Right.
DAVE:
Then the case study itself is mostly quite standard; we begin by presenting the problem, and giving some background, then go through the main sections, but
the thing that surprised me is that in a normal report we’d end with some suggestions to deal with the problem or need we
identified.
But in a case study we end up with a question or a series of questions to our readers.
And they decide what ought to be done (Q26)
.
NATALIE:
Oh, I hadn’t realised that.
NATALIE:
So basically, the problem we’re addressing in our case study of the Horton Castle site is why so few tourists are visiting it.
And we’ll find out more from our interviews, but I did find one report on the internet that suggested that one reason might be because as far as transport goes, access is difficult.
DAVE:
I read that too, but that report was actually written ten years ago, when the road there was really bad, but that’s been improved now.
And I think there’s plenty of
fascinating
stuff there for a really good day out.
But you’d never realise it from the castle website – maybe that’s the problem
(Q27)
.
NATALIE:
Yes, it’s really dry and boring.
DAVE:
I read somewhere a suggestion that what the castle needs is a visitor centre.
So we could have a look for some information about that on the internet.
What would we need to know?
NATALIE:
Well, who’d use it for a start?
It’d be good to know what categories the visitors fell into too, like school parties or retired people, but I think we’d have to talk to staff to get that information.
DAVE:
OK. And as we’re thinking of suggesting a visitor centre we’d also have to look at
potential
problems.
I mean, obviously it wouldn’t be cheap to set up.
NATALIE:
No, but it could be a really good investment.
And as it’s on a historical site it’d need to get special planning permission, I expect.
That might be hard (Q28)
.
DAVE:
Right, especially as the only possible place for it would be at the entrance, and that’s right in front of the castle.
NATALIE:
Mmm.
DAVE:
But it could be a good thing for the town of Horton.
At present it’s a bit of a ghost town.
Once they’ve left school and got any skills or qualifications.
The young people all get out as fast as they can to get jobs in the city.
And the only people left are children and those who’ve retired (Q29)
.
NATALIE:
Right. Something else we could investigate would be the
potential
damage that tourists might cause to the castle site, I mean their environmental impact.
At present the tourists can just
wander
round wherever they want,
but if numbers increase, there might have to be some
restrictions, like sticking to marked ways.
And there’d need to be guides and wardens around to make sure these were enforced (Q30)
.
DAVE:
Yes, we could look at that too. OK, well …

剑桥雅思17Test1Part2听力答案解析 Boat trip round Tasmania
剑桥雅思17 Test1 Part2
雅思听力
原文
So, hello everyone. My name’s Lou Miller and I’m going to be your tour guide today as we take this fantastic boat trip around the Tasmanian coast. Before we set off, I just want to tell you a few things about our journey.
Our boats aren’t huge as you can see. We already have three staff members on board and on top of that, we can transport a further fifteen people – that’s you – around the coastline. But please note
if there are more than nine people on either side of the boat, we’ll move some of you over (Q11)
, otherwise all eighteen of us will end up in the sea!
We’ve recently upgraded all our boats. They used to be jet black, but our new ones now have these comfortable dark red seats and a
light-green exterior (Q12)
in order to stand out from others and help promote our company. This gives our boats a rather unique appearance, don’t you think?
We offer you a free lunchbox during the trip and we have three types. Lunchbox 1 contains ham and tomato sandwiches.
Lunchbox 2 contains a cheddar cheese roll (Q13)
and Lunchbox 3 is salad-based and also contains eggs and tuna. All three lunchboxes also have a packet of crisps and chocolate bar inside. Please let staff know which lunchbox you prefer.
I’m sure I don’t have to ask you not to throw anything into the sea. We don’t have any bins to put litter in, but
Jess, myself or Ray, our other guide, will collect it from you (Q14)
after lunch and put it all in a large plastic sack.
The engine on the boat makes quite a lot of noise so before we head off, let me tell you a few things about what you’re going to see.
This area is famous for its ancient lighthouse, which you’ll see from the boat as we turn past the first little island. It was built in 1838
to protect sailors as a number of shipwrecks had led to significant loss of life (Q15)
. The construction itself was complicated as some of the original drawings kept by the local council show. . It sits right on top of the cliffs in a very isolated spot. In the nineteenth century there were many jobs there, such as polishing the brass lamps, chopping firewood and cleaning windows, that kept lighthouse keepers busy.
These workers were mainly prison convicts until the middle of that century when ordinary families willing to live in such circumstances took over (Q16)
.
Some of you have asked me what creatures we can expect to see. I know everyone loves the penguins, but they’re very shy and, unfortunately, tend to hide from passing boats, but you might see birds in the distance, such as sea eagles, flying around the cliff edges where they nest. When we get to the rocky area inhabited by
fur seals, we’ll stop and watch them swimming around the coast. They’re inquisitive creatures so don’t be surprised if one pops up right in front of you (Q17)
. Their predators, orca whales, hunt along the coastline too, but spotting one of these is rare.
Dolphins, on the other hand, can sometimes approach on their own or in groups as they ride the waves beside us (Q18)
.
Lastly, I want to mention the caves. Tasmania is famous for its caves and the ones we’ll pass by are so amazing that people are lost for words when they see them.
They can only
be approached by sea (Q19)
, but if you feel that you want to see more than we’re able to show you, then you can take a kayak into the area on another day and one of our staff will give you more information on that. What we’ll do is to go through a narrow channel, past some incredible rock formations and from there
we’ll be able to see the openings to the caves, and at that point we’ll talk to you about what lies beyond (Q20)
.

剑桥雅思11Test1Section4听力答案解析 Ocean Biodiversity
剑桥雅思11 test1 section4
雅思听力
原文
I’ve been looking at ocean
biodiversity
, that’s the
diversity
of species that live in the world’s oceans.
About 20 years ago biologists developed the idea of what they called ‘
biodiversity
hotspots’.
These are the areas which have the greatest mixture of species, so one example is
Madagascar
.
These hotspots are significant because they allow us to locate key areas for focusing efforts at
conservation (Q31)
.
Biologists can identify hotspots on land, fairly easily, but until recently, very little was known about species
distribution
and
diversity
in the oceans, and no one even knew if hotspots existed there.
Then a Canadian biologist called Boris Worm did some research in 2005 on data on ocean species that he got from the fishing industry.
Worm located five hotspots for large ocean predators like sharks, and looked at what they had in common.
The main thing he’d expected to find was that they had very high concentrations of
food (Q32)
.
But to his surprise that was only true for four of the hotspots – the remaining hotspot was quite badly off in that regard.
But what he did find was that in all cases, the water at the
surface (Q33)
of the ocean had
relatively
high temperatures, even when it was cool at greater depths, so this seemed to be a factor in supporting a
diverse
range of these large predators.
However, this wasn’t enough on its own, because he also found that the water needed to have enough
oxygen (Q34)
in it – so these two factors seemed necessary to support the high
metabolic
rate of these large fish.
A couple of years later, in 2007, a researcher called Lisa Ballance, who was working in California, also started looking for ocean hotspots, but not for fish – what she was interested in was marine
mammals (Q35)
, things like seals.
And she found three places in the oceans which were hotspots, and what these had in common was that these hotspots were all located at boundaries between ocean currents, and this seems to be the sort of place that has lots of the
plankton
that some of these species feed on.
So now people who want to protect the species that are endangered need to get as much information as possible.
For example, there’s an international project called the Census of Marine Life.
They’ve been surveying oceans all over the world, including the
Arctic
.
One thing they found there which stunned other researchers was that there were large numbers of species which live below the
ice (Q36)
– sometimes under a layer up to 20 metres thick.
Some of these species had never been seen before.
They’ve even found species of
octopus
living in these conditions.
And other scientists working on the same project, but researching very different habitats on the ocean floor, have found large numbers of species congregating around volcanoes, attracted to them by the warmth and nutrients there.
However, biologists still don’t know how serious the threat to their survival is for each individual species.
So a body called the Global Marine Species
Assessment
is now creating a list of endangered species on land, so they consider things like the size of the population – how many members of one species there are in a
particular
place – and then they look at their d
istribution
in
geographical
terms, although this is quite difficult when you’re looking at fish, because they’re so mobile, and then thirdly they calculate the rate at which the
decline (Q37)
of the species is happening.
So far only 1,500 species have been assessed, but they want to increase this figure to 20,000.
For each one they
assess
, they use the data they collect on that species to produce a
map (Q38)
showing its
distribution
.
Ultimately they will be able to use these to figure out not only where most species are located but also where they are most threatened.
So finally, what can be done to
retain
the
diversity
of species in the world’s oceans?
Firstly, we need to set up more reserves in our oceans, places where marine species are protected.
We have some, but not enough.
In addition, to
preserve
species such as leatherback turtles, which live out in the high seas but have their nesting sites on the American coast, we need to create corridors for
migration
(Q39)
, so they can get from one area to another safely.
As well as this, action needs to be taken to lower the levels of fishing quotas to prevent overfishing of endangered species.
And finally, there’s the problem of ‘by-catch’.
This refers to the catching of unwanted fish by fishing boats – they’re returned to the sea, but they’re often dead or dying.
If these commercial fishing boats used equipment which was more selective, so that only the fish wanted for
consumption
(Q40)
were caught, this problem could be overcome.
OK.
So does anyone have any …

剑桥雅思15Test1Part4听力答案解析 The Eucalyptus Tree in Australia
剑桥雅思15 Test1 Part4
雅思听力
原文
Today I’m going to talk about the eucalyptus tree. This is a very common tree here in Australia, where it’s also sometimes called the gum tree. First I’m going to talk about why it’s important, then I’m going to describe some problems it faces at present.
Right, well the eucalyptus tree is an important tree for lots of reasons. For example, it gives
shelter (Q31)
to creatures like birds and bats, and these and other species also depend on it for food, particularly the nectar from its flowers. So it supports biodiversity. It’s useful to us humans too, because we can kill germs with a disinfectant made from
oil (Q32)
extracted from eucalyptus leaves.
The eucalyptus grows all over Australia and the trees can live for up to four hundred years. So it’s alarming that all across the country, numbers of eucalyptus are falling because the trees are dying off prematurely. So what are the reasons for this?
One possible reason is disease. As far back as the 1970s the trees started getting a disease called Mundulla Yellows. The trees’ leaves would gradually turn yellow, then the tree would die. It wasn’t until 2004 that they found the cause of the problem was lime, or calcium hydroxide to give it its proper chemical name, which was being used in the construction of
roads (Q33)
. The lime was being washed away into the ground and affecting the roots of the eucalyptus trees nearby. What it was doing was preventing the trees from sucking up the iron they needed for healthy growth. When this was injected back into the affected trees, they immediately recovered.
But this problem only affected a relatively small number of trees. By 2000, huge numbers of eucalyptus were dying along Australia’s East Coast, of a disease known as Bell-miner Associated Die-back. The bell-miner is a bird, and the disease seems to be common where there are high populations of bell-miners. Again it’s the leaves of the trees that are affected What happens is that
insects (Q34)
settle on the leaves and eat their way round them, destroying them as they go, and at the same time they secrete a solution which has sugar in it. The bell miner birds really like this solution, and in order to get as much as possible, they keep away other creatures that might try to get it. So these birds and insects flourish at the expense of other species, and eventually so much damage is done to the leaves that the tree dies.
But experts say that trees can start looking sick before any sign of Bell-miner Associated Dieback. So it looks as if the problem might have another explanation. One possibility is that it’s to do with the huge bushfires that we have in Australia. A theory proposed over 40 years ago by ecologist William Jackson is that the frequency of bushfires in a particular region affects the type of vegetation that grows there. If there are very frequent bushfires in a region, this encourages
grass (Q35)
to grow afterwards, while if the bushfires are rather less frequent, this results in the growth of eucalyptus forests.
So why is this? Why do fairly frequent bushfires actually support the growth of eucalyptus? Well, one reason is that the fire stops the growth of other species which would consume
water (Q36)
needed by eucalyptus trees. And there’s another reason. If these other quick-growing species of bushes and plants are allowed to proliferate, they harm the eucalyptus in another way, by affecting the composition of the
soil (Q37)
, and removing nutrients from it. So some bushfires are actually essential for the eucalyptus to survive as long as they are not too frequent. In fact there’s evidence that Australia’s indigenous people practised regular burning of bush land for thousands of years before the arrival of the Europeans.
But since Europeans arrived on the continent, the number of bushfires has been strictly controlled. Now scientists believe that this reduced frequency of bushfires to low levels has led to what’s known as ‘
dry (Q38)
rainforest’, which seems an odd name as usually we associate tropical rainforest with wet conditions. And what’s special about this type of rainforest? Well, unlike tropical rainforest which is a rich ecosystem, this type of ecosystem is usually a
simple (Q39)
one. It has very thick, dense vegetation, but not much variety of species. The vegetation provides lots of shade, so one species that does find it ideal is the bell-miner bird, which builds its
nests (Q40)
in the undergrowth there. But again that’s not helpful for the eucalyptus tree.

剑7 test 1 Section 1
雅思听力
原文
MAN: Hello, this is Land Transport Information at Toronto Airport. How may I help you?
WOMAN: Oh, good morning. Um, I’m flying to Toronto Airport next week, and I need to get to a town called um, Milton. Could you tell me how I can get there?
MAN: Milton, did you say? Let me see. I think that’s about 150 miles southwest of here. In fact it’s
147 miles
to be exact, so it’ll take you at least – say, three to four hours by road.
Example
WOMAN: Wow! Is it as far as that?
MAN: Yes, I’m afraid so. But you have a number of options to get you there and you can always rent a car right here at the airport, of course.
WOMAN: Right. Well, I don’t really want to drive myself, so I’d like more information about public transport.
MAN: OK. In that case the quickest and most comfortable is
a cab
and of course there are always plenty available. But it’ll cost you. You can also take a Greyhound bus or there’s an Airport Shuttle Service to Milton.
Q1
WOMAN: Hmmm, I think for that kind of distance a cab would be way beyond my budget. But the bus sounds OK. Can you tell me how much that would cost?
MAN: Sure. Let’s see, that would be $15 one way, or $27.50 return… that’s on the Greyhound.
WOMAN: Oh, that’s quite cheap – great! But whereabouts does it stop in Milton?
MAN: It goes directly from the airport here to the
City Centre
and it’s pretty fast. But you have to bear in mind that there is only one departure a day, so it depends what time your flight gets in.
Q2
WOMAN: Oh, of course. Hang on, we’re due to get there at 11.30 am.
MAN: Hmmm, too bad, the bus leaves at 3.45,
so you would have quite a wait
– more than 4 hours.
Q3
WOMAN: Oh, I see. Well, what about the Shuttle you mentioned?
MAN: OK. That’s the Airport Shuttle that will take you from the airport right to your hotel or private address.
It’s a door-to-door service
and it would suit you much better, because there’s one every two hours.
Q4
WOMAN: So how much does that cost?
MAN: Let’s see. Yeah, that’s $35 one way, $65 return, so I guess it’s a bit more expensive than the Greyhound.
WOMAN: Oh, that doesn’t sound too bad, especially if it’ll take me straight to the hotel.
MAN: But you do need to
reserve a seat
.
Q5
WOMAN: OK, is it possible to make a booking right now? Through you?
MAN: Sure.
MAN: OK, I just have to fill this form out for you. So what date do you want to book this for?
WOMAN: The 16th of October – oh, no, sorry, that’s my departure date.
I arrive on the 17th
, so book it for then, please.
Q6
MAN: So, that’s the Toronto Airport Shuttle to Milton. And this is for just one person or…?
WOMAN: Yes, just me, please.
MAN: Right. And you said your expected time of arrival was 11.30? So if I book your Shuttle for after 12.00 – let’s say,
12.30
: that should give you plenty of time to, you know, collect your baggage, maybe grab a coffee?
Q7
WOMAN:
Yeah, that sounds fine
, as long as we land on time!
MAN: Well, we’ll take your flight details so you don’t need to worry too much about that. Now, what about the fare? What sort of ticket do you want? One way or…?
WOMAN: Yes, that’ll be fine, provided I can book the return trip once I’m there.
MAN: No problem -just allow a couple of days in advance to make sure you get a seat. And what’s your name, please?
WOMAN.: Janet, Janet Thomson.
MAN: Is that Thompson spelt with a p.
WOMAN: No, it’s
T-H-O-M-S-O-N
.
Q8
MAN: OK. And you’ll be coming from the UK? What flight will you be travelling on?
WOMAN: Oh, it’s Air Canada flight number
AC936
, from London Heathrow.
Q9
WMAN: Right. Now, do you know where you’ll be staying? We need to give the driver an address.
WOMAN: Yes, it’s called the Vacation Motel – and I think it’s near the town centre. Anyway, the address is 24, Kitchener Street – that’s KITCHENER Street.
MAN: That’s fine. Right, so that’s $35 to pay please. Have you got your credit card number there?
WOMAN: Yes, it’s a VISA card, and the number is
3303 8450 2045 6837
.
Q10
MAN: OK. Well, that seems to be everything. Have a good trip and we’ll see you in Toronto next week!
WOMAN: Yes, bye – oh, thanks for your help!

剑桥雅思14 test2 section2
雅思听力
原文
We’ll be arriving at Branley Castle in about five minutes, but before we get there I’ll give you a little information about the castle and what our visit will include.
So in fact there’s been a castle on this site for over eleven hundred years. The first building was a fort constructed in 914 AD for defence against Danish invaders by King Alfred the Great’s daughter, who ruled England at the time. In the following century, after the Normans conquered England, the land was given to a nobleman called Richard de Vere, and he built a castle there that stayed in the de Vere family for over four hundred years.
However, when Queen Elizabeth I announced that she was going to visit the castle in 1576 it was beginning to look a bit run down, and it was decided that rather than repair the guest rooms,
they’d make a new house for her (Q11)
out of wood next to the main hall. She stayed there for four nights and apparently it was very luxurious, but unfortunately it was destroyed a few years later by fire.
In the seventeenth century the castle belonged to the wealthy Fenys family, who enlarged it and made it more comfortable. However, by 1982 the Fenys family could no longer afford to maintain the castle, even though they received government support, and they put it on the market. It was eventually taken over by
a company who owned a number of amusement parks (Q12)
, but when we get there I think you’ll see that they’ve managed to retain the original atmosphere of the castle.
When you go inside, you’ll find that in the state rooms
there are life-like moving wax models dressed in costumes of different periods in the past (Q13)
, which even carry on conversations together. As well as that, in every room there are booklets giving information about what the room was used for and the history of the objects and furniture it contains.
The castle park’s quite extensive. At one time sheep were kept there, and in the nineteenth century the owners had a little zoo with animals like rabbits and even a baby elephant. Nowadays the old zoo buildings are used for
public displays of paintings and sculpture (Q14)
. The park also has some beautiful trees, though the oldest of all, which dated back 800 years, was sadly blown down in 1987.
Now, you’re free to wander around on your own until 4.30, but then at the end of our visit we’ll all meet together at the bottom of the Great Staircase. We’ll then go on to the long gallery, where there’s a wonderful collection of photographs showing the family who owned the castle a hundred years ago having tea and cakes in the conservatory – and we’ll then take you to
the same place, where afternoon tea will be served to you (Q15)
.
Now if you can take a look at your plans you’ll see Branley Castle has four towers, joined together by a high wall, with the river on two sides.
Don’t miss seeing the Great Hall. That’s near the river in the main tower, the biggest one, which was extended and redesigned in the eighteenth century.
If you want to get a good view of the whole castle, you can walk around the walls.
The starting point’s quite near the main entrance – walk straight down the path until you get to the south gate, and it’s just there (Q16)
. Don’t go on to the north gate – there’s no way up from there.
There’ll shortly be a show in which you can see archers displaying their skill with a bow and arrow. The quickest way to get there is to
take the first left after the main entrance and follow the path past the bridge, then you’ll see it in front of you at the end (Q17)
.
If you like animals there’s also a display of hunting birds – falcons and eagles and so on. If you
go from the main entrance in the direction of the south gate, but turn right before you get there instead of going through it, you’ll see it on your right past the first tower (Q18)
.
At 3 pm there’s a short performance of traditional dancing on the
outdoor stage. That’s right at the other side of the castle from the entrance, and over the bridge (Q19)
. It’s about ten minutes’ walk or so.
And finally the shop. It’s actually
inside one of the towers, but the way in is from the outside. Just take the first left after the main entrance, go down the path and take the first right (Q20)
. It’s got some lovely gifts and souvenirs.
Right, so we’re just arriving …

剑桥雅思17 Test1 Part4
雅思听力
原文
Labyrinths have existed for well over 4,000 years. Labyrinths and labyrinthine symbols have been found in regions as diverse as modern-day Turkey, Ireland, Greece, and India. There are various designs of labyrinth but what they all have in common is a winding spiral path which leads to a central area. There is one starting point at the entrance and the goal is to reach the central area. Finding your way through a labyrinth involves many twists and turns, but it’s not possible to get lost as there is only one single path.
In modern times, the word labyrinth has taken on a different meaning and is often used as a synonym for a maze. A maze is quite different as it is a kind of
puzzle (Q31)
with an intricate network of paths. Mazes became fashionable in the 15th and 16th centuries in Europe, and can still be found in the gardens of great houses and palaces. The paths are usually surrounded by thick, high hedges so that it’s not possible to see over them. Entering a maze usually involves getting lost a few times before using
logic (Q32)
to work out the pattern and find your way to the centre and then out again. There are lots of dead ends and paths which lead you back to where you started. The word ‘maze’ is believed to come from a Scandinavian word for a state of
confusion (Q33)
. This is where the word ‘amazing’ comes from.
Labyrinths, on the other hand, have a very different function. Although people now often refer to things they find complicated as labyrinths, this is not how they were seen in the past. The winding spiral of the labyrinth has been used for centuries as a metaphor for life’s journey. It served as a spiritual reminder that there is purpose and meaning to our lives and helped to give people a sense of direction. Labyrinths are thought to encourage a feeling of calm and have been used as a
meditation (Q34)
and prayer tool in many cultures over many centuries.
The earliest examples of the labyrinth spiral pattern have been found carved into
stone (Q35)
, from Sardinia to Scandinavia, from Arizona to India to Africa. In Europe, these spiral carvings date from the late Bronze Age. The Native American Pima tribe wove baskets with a circular labyrinth design that depicted their own cosmology. In Ancient Greece, the labyrinth spiral was used on
coins (Q36)
around four thousand years ago. Labyrinths made of mosaics were commonly found in bathhouses, villas and tombs throughout the Roman Empire.
In Northern Europe, there were actual physical labyrinths designed for walking on. These were cut into the turf or grass, usually in a circular pattern. The origin of these walking labyrinths remains unclear, but they were probably used for fertility rites which may date back thousands of years. Eleven examples of turf labyrinths survive today, including the largest one at Saffron Walden, England, which used to have a large
tree (Q37)
in the middle of it.
More recently labyrinths have experienced something of a revival. Some believe that walking a labyrinth promotes healing and mindfulness, and there are those who believe in its emotional and physical benefits, which include slower
breathing (Q38)
and a restored sense of balance and perspective. This idea has become so popular that labyrinths have been laid into the floors of spas, wellness centres and even prisons in recent years.
A pamphlet at Colorado Children’s Hospital informs patients that ‘walking a labyrinth can often calm people in the midst of a crisis’. And apparently, it’s not only patients who benefit. Many visitors find walking a labyrinth less stressful than sitting in a corridor or waiting room. Some doctors even walk the labyrinth during their breaks. In some hospitals, patients who can’t walk can have a
paper (Q39)
‘finger labyrinth’ brought to their bed. The science behind the theory is a little sketchy, but there are dozens of small-scale studies which support claims about the benefits of labyrinths. For example, one study found that walking a labyrinth provided ‘short-term calming, relaxation, and relief from
anxiety (Q40)
’ for Alzheimer’s patients.
So, what is it about labyrinths that makes their appeal so universal? Well …

JUDY:         Right, and what was the third item?
MICHAEL:      My dining room table. It’s a lovely table from Indonesia. It must have been very hot inside the container because one
leg
has completely split (
Q8
) down the middle. The top and the other three look okay thank goodness.
JUDY:         Any idea of the price to repair it?
MICHAEL:      Well, I had an estimate done on this actually because it is a very special table to us. They quoted us $200, which is really pricey so I hope the insurance will cover the total cost.
JUDY:         I’m sure that will be fine. What was the last item, Mr Alexander?
MICHAEL:      Well, we have a lovely set of china plates and dishes, you know, with matching cups, saucers, the lot. They were all in the one box which must have got dropped because some
plates
(
Q9
) were broken – six actually.
JUDY:         And can you tell me the replacement value of these?
MICHAEL:      Well, it’s hard to say because they were part of a set but they can be up to $10 each as it’s such a good set.
JUDY:         Okay, so that would be around
$60
(
Q10
) altogether?
MICHAEL:      Yes, that’s right.
JUDY:         And is that all of the items?
MICHAEL:      Yes. So what do I have to do now?

剑桥雅思12Test5Section4听力答案解析 Four business values
剑桥雅思12
test5 Section4
雅思听力
原文
In public discussion of business, we take certain values for granted.
Today, I am going to talk about four of them: collaboration, hard work, creativity and excellence.
Most People would say they are all good things.
I’m going to suggest that’s an over-simple view.
The trouble with these values is that they are
theoretical
concepts, removed from the reality of day-to-day business.
Pursue values by all means, but be prepared for what may happen as a result.
They can actually cause
damage (Q31)
, which is not at all the intention.
Business leaders generally try to do the right thing.
But all too often the right thing backfires if those leaders adopt values without understanding and managing the
side effects (Q32)
that arise.
The values can easily get in the way of what is actually intended.
Ok. So the first value I am going to discuss is collaboration, Er, let me give you an example.
On a management training course I once attended, we were put into groups and had to
construct
a
bridge (Q33)
across a stream, using building blocks that we were given.
The rule was that everyone in the team had to move at least one building block during the construction.
This was intended to encourage teamwork.
But it was really a job best done by one person.
The other teams tried to
collaborate
on building the structure, and descended into
confusion (Q34)
, with everyone getting in each other’s way.
Our team leader solved the challenge brilliantly.
She simply asked everyone in the team to move a piece a few centimeters, to comply with the rule, and then let the person in the team with an
aptitude
for puzzles like this build it alone.
We finished before any other team.
My point is that the task wasn’t really suited to teamworking, so why make it one?
Teamwork can also lead to inconsistency – a common cause of poor sales.
In the case of a
smartphone (Q35)
that a certain company launched, one director wanted to target the business market, and another demanded it was aimed at consumers.
The company wanted both directors to be involved, so gave the product a consumer-friendly name, but marketed it to companies.
The result was that it met the needs of neither group.
It would have better to let one director or the other have this way, not both.
Now industriousness, or hard work.
It’s easy to mock people who say they work hard: after all, a
hamster
running around in a wheel is working hard and getting nowhere.
Of course hard work is valuable, but only when properly targeted.
Otherwise it wastes the
resources (Q36)
that companies value most – time and energy.
And that’s bad for the
organization
.
There’s a management model that groups people according to four criteria: clever, hard-working, stupid and lazy.
Here ‘lazy’ means having a rational determination not to carry out
unnecessary
(Q37)
tasks.
It doesn’t mean trying to avoid work
altogether
.
Most people display two of these characteristics, and the most valuable people are those who are both clever and lazy: they possess intellectual clarity, and they don’t rush into making decisions.
They come up with solutions to save the time and energy spent by the stupid and hard-working group.
Instead of throwing more man-hours at a problem, the clever and lazy group looks for a more effective solution.
Next we come to creativity.
This often works well – creating an attention-grapping TV commercial, for example, might lead to increased sales.
But it isn’t always a good thing.
Some advertising campaigns are remembered for their creativity, without having any effect on sales.
This happened a few years ago with the
launch
of a
chocolate bar (Q38)
;
subsequent
research showed that plenty of consumers remembered the advert, but had no idea what was being advertised.
The troubles is that the creator derives pleasure from coming up with the idea, and wrongly assumes the audience for the campaign will share that feeling.
A company that brings out thousands of new products may seem more creative than a company that only has a few, but it may be too creative, and make smaller profits.
Creativity needs to be targeted to solve a
problem (Q39)
that the company has identified.
Just coming up with more and more novel products isn’t necessarily a good thing.
And finally, excellence.
We all know companies that claim they ‘strive for excellence’, but it takes a long time to achieve excellence.
In business, being first with a product is more
profitable
than having the best product.
A major study of company performance compared pioneers – that is, companies bringing out the first version of a
particular
product – with followers, the companies that copied and improved on that product.
The study found that the pioneers commanded an average
market share (Q40)
of 29 percent, while the followers achieved less than half that, only 13 percent – even though their product might have been better.
Insisting on excellence in everything we do is time-consuming, wastes energy and leads to losing out on opportunities.
Sometimes, second-rate work is more worthwhile than excellence.
“Make sure it’s excellent” sounds like a good approach to business, but the “just get-started” approach is likely to be more successful.

剑桥雅思16 Test4 Part2
雅思听力
原文
CHAIRPERSON:
Right. Next on the agenda we have traffic and highways. Councillor Thornton
COUNCILLOR THORNTON:
Thank you. Well, we now have the results of the survey carried out last month about traffic and road transport in the town. People were generally satisfied with the state of the roads. There were one or two complaints about potholes which will be addressed,
but a significant number of people complained about the increasing number of heavy vehicles (Q11)
using our local roads to avoid traffic elsewhere. We’d expected more complaints by commuters about the reduction in the train service, but it doesn’t seem to have affected people too much. The cycle path that runs alongside the river is very well used by both cyclists and pedestrians since the surface was improved last year but overtaking can be a problem so
we’re going to add a bit on the side to make it wider (Q12)
. At some stage, we’d like to extend the path so that it goes all the way through the town, but that won’t be happening in the immediate future
The plans to have a pedestrian crossing next to the Post Office have unfortunately had to be put on hold for the time being. We’d budgeted for this to be done this financial year, but then there were rumours that the Post Office was going to move, which would have meant there wasn’t really a need for a crossing. Now they’ve confirmed that they’re staying where they are, but the Highways Department have told us that
it would be dangerous to have a pedestrian crossing where we’d originally planned it as there’s a bend in the road there (Q13)
.
So that’ll need some more thought.
On Station Road near the station and level crossing, drivers can face
quite long waits if the level crossing’s closed, and we’ve now got signs up requesting them not to leave their engines running at that time (Q14)
. This means pedestrians waiting on the pavement to cross
the railway line don’t have to breathe in car fumes. We’ve had some problems with cyclists leaving their bikes chained to the railings outside the ticket office, but the station has agreed to provide bike racks there.
CHAIRPERSON:
So next on the agenda is ‘Proposals for improvements to the recreation ground’. Councillor Thornton again.
COUNCILLOR THORNTON:
Well, since we managed to extend the recreation ground, we’ve spent some time talking to local people about how it could be made a more attractive and useful space. If you have a look at the map up on the screen, you can see the river up in the north. and the Community Hall near the entrance from the road. At present, cars can park between the Community Hall and that line of trees to the east, but this is quite dangerous for pedestrians so we’re suggesting
a new car park on the opposite side of the Community Hall, right next to it (Q15)
. We also have a new location for the cricket pitch. As we’ve now purchased additional space
to the east of the recreation ground, beyond the trees (Q16)
, we plan to move it away from its current location. which is rather near the road, into this new area beyond the line of trees. This means there’s less danger of stray balls hitting cars or pedestrians
We’ve got plans for a children’s playground which will be
accessible by a footpath from the Community Hall and will be alongside the river (Q17)
. We’d originally thought of having it close to the road. but we think this will be a more attractive location.
The skateboard ramp is very popular with both younger and older children-we had considered moving this up towards the river, but in the end we decided to have it
in the southeast corner near the road (Q18)
. The pavilion is very well used at present by both football players and cricketers. It will stay where it is now –
to the left of the line of trees and near to the river (Q19)
– handy for both the football and cricket pitches And finally, we’ll be getting a new notice board for local information, and that will be
directly on people’s right as they go from the road into the recreation ground (Q20)
.

剑桥雅思9 test 3 Section 2
雅思听力
原文
WOMAN
: For the second in our series about locally-run businesses, we meet Simon Winridge, co-founder of the hugely-successful Winridge Forest Railway Park. Welcome, Simon. Now, perhaps you can begin by telling us a little bit about how it all started.
MAN
: Well, during the 1970s, my wife, Liz and I had just acquired 80 acres of sheep-farming land, and we decided to settle down and have children. Pretty soon we had a daughter, Sarah, and a son, Duncan. The place was wonderful for the kids: they particularly loved trains and gradually built up an enormous network of miniature railway track.  I began to develop larger-scale models of locomotives but we didn’t think anything more of it until
I went on a trip to a theme park near Birmingham and decided we could do a much better job (Q11)!
So we set up a small one ourselves based on the miniature railway and
we opened to the public for just a month that year, 1984 – in July – our driest month – because our children said they didn’t want our guests to have a miserable wet visit (Q12).
I dealt with Park business and Liz carried on with the farm work.
It soon became clear that we were onto a winner. We began to extend the railway track and lay it among more interesting landscape by planting trees, which in turn attracted more wildlife, and by making cuttings through the rock.
Nowadays, we’re open all year round and we’re pleased to say that Winridge is one of the most popular visitor attractions in the area – with 50,000 visitors a year-
a million and a half people have been through our doors since we opened (Q13)
.
All these visitors mean we have had to expand our operation and it’s now a truly family concern. I’m near to retirement age so
I only concern myself with looking after the mechanical side of things (Q14)
– keeping the trains going.
Liz now devotes all her energies to recruiting and supporting the large squadron of workers (Q15)
which keep the place running smoothly. We’re really pleased that after some years away teaching,
Sarah has now returned to the park and makes sure the visitors are kept fed and watered (Q16)
,
which keeps her pretty busy as you can imagine. Our son,
Duncan, has been a stalwart of the park for the last ten years, taking over from me in the area of construction (Q17)
– and I’ll say a little bit more about that in a moment – and
his new wife, Judith, has also joined the team in charge of retail (Q18).
That’s becoming a tremendous growth area for us – a lot of people want to buy souvenirs.
WOMAN
: So have you finished your development of the site for the moment?
MAN
: Not at all! We’re constantly looking for ways to offer more to our visitors.
The railway remains the central feature and there’s now 1.2 kilometres of the line laid but we’d like to lay more. Because of the geology of the area, our greatest problem is digging tunnels. But we’re gradually overcoming that. We’re also very pleased with a new installation of the Go-Kart arena which is
120 (Q19)
square metres in area. Again the problem is the geology; we had to level the mounds on the track for safety reasons. We wanted to enable
5-12 (Q20)
year olds to use the go-karts. And the main attraction here is the Formula 1 Kart. We’ve known fights to break out over who gets it! And then finally to our most recent development which is the landscaped …

剑桥雅思15 Test1 Part3
雅思听力
原文
ANNIE:
OK, Jack. Before we plan our presentation about refrigeration, let’s discuss what we’ve discovered so far
JACK:
Fine, Annie. Though I have to admit I haven’t done much research yet.
ANNIE:
Nor me. But I found an interesting article about icehouses. I’d seen some 18th- and 19th-century ones here in the UK, so I knew they were often built in a shady area or underground, close to lakes that might freeze in the winter. Then blocks of ice could be cut and stored in the icehouse.
But I didn’t realise that insulating the blocks with straw or sawdust meant they didn’t melt for months (Q21)
. The ancient Romans had refrigeration, too.
JACK:
I didn’t know that.
ANNIE:
Yes, pits were dug in the ground, and snow was imported from the mountains – even though they were at quite a distance. The snow was stored in the pits. Ice formed at the bottom of it.
Both the ice and the snow were then sold (Q22)
. The ice cost more than the snow and my guess is that only the wealthy members of society could afford it
JACK:
I wouldn’t be surprised. I also came across an article about modern domestic fridges. Several different technologies are used, but they were too complex for me to understand
ANNIE:
You have to wonder what happens when people get rid of old ones.
JACK:
You mean because the gases in them are harmful for the environment?
ANNIE:
Exactly. At least there are now plenty of organisations that will recycle most of the components safely, but of course
some people just dump old fridges in the countryside (Q23)
.
JACK:
It’s hard to see how they can be stopped unfortunately (Q23)
. In the UK we get rid of three million a year altogether!.
ANNIE:
That sounds a lot, especially because fridges hardly ever break down.
JACK:
That’s right. In this country we keep domestic fridges for 11 years on average, and a lot last for 20 or more.
So if you divide the cost by the number of years you can use a fridge, they’re not expensive, compared with some household appliances (Q24)
.
ANNIE:
True. I suppose manufacturers encourage people to spend more by making them different colours and designs. I’m sure when my parents bought their first fridge they had hardly any choice!
JACK:
Yes, there’s been quite a change.
JACK:
Right, let’s make a list of topics to cover in our presentation, and decide who’s going to do more research on them. Then later, we can get together and plan the next step.
ANNIE:
OK. How about starting with how useful refrigeration is, and
the range of goods that are refrigerated (Q25)
nowadays?
Because of course it’s not just food and drinks.
JACK:
No, I suppose flowers and medicines are refrigerated, too.
ANNIE:
And computers.
I could do that (Q25)
, unless you particularly want to.
JACK:
No, that’s fine by me.
What about the effects of refrigeration on people’s health (Q26)?
After all, some of the chemicals used in the 19th century were pretty harmful, but there have been lots of benefits too, like always having access to fresh food. Do you fancy dealing with that?
ANNIE:
I’m not terribly keen, to be honest.
JACK:
Nor me. My mind just goes blank when I read anything about chemicals.
ANNIE:
Oh, all right then, I’ll do you a favour (Q26)
. But you owe me, Jack.
OK.
What about the effects on food producers (Q27)
, like farmers in poorer countries being able to export their produce to developed countries? Something for you, maybe?
JACK:
I don’t mind. It should be quite interesting (Q27)
.
ANNIE:
I think we should also look at
how refrigeration has helped whole cities (Q28)
– like Las Vegas, which couldn’t exist without refrigeration because it’s in the middle of a desert.
JACK:
Right. I had a quick look at an economics book in the library that’s got a chapter about this sort of thing. I could give you the title, if you want to do this section.
ANNIE:
Not particularly, to be honest. I find economics books pretty heavy going, as a rule.
JACK:
OK,
leave it to me, then (Q28)
.
ANNIE:
Thanks.
Then there’s transport
, and the difference that refrigerated trucks have made.
I wouldn’t mind having a go at that (Q29)
.
JACK:
Don’t forget trains, too. I read something about milk and butter being transported in refrigerated railroad cars in the USA, right back in the 1840s.
ANNIE:
I hadn’t thought of trains. Thanks.
JACK:
Shall we have a separate section on
domestic fridges (Q30)
? After all, they’re something everyone’s familiar with.
ANNIE:
What about splitting it into two (Q30)
? You could investigate 19th-and 20th-century fridges, and I’ll concentrate on what’s available these days, and how manufacturers differentiate their products from those of their competitors.
JACK:
OK,
that’d suit me (Q30)
.

Hello, and welcome to Focus on the Arts. I’m your host – Dave Green – and this is your very own local radio programme. Every Friday evening we put the spotlight on different arts and culture facilities and look at the shows and events that are on offer in the coming week.
And today the focus is on The National Arts Centre. Now, if you don’t already know it yourself, I’m sure you’ve all heard of it. It’s famous throughout the world
as one of the major venues for
classical music (Q11)
.
But did you know that it is actually much more than just a place to hear concerts? The Centre itself is a huge complex that caters for a great range of arts. Under a single roof, it houses concert rooms, theatres, cinemas, art galleries and a wonderful public library, as well as service facilities including three restaurants and a
bookshop (Q12)
. So at any one time, the choice of entertainment there is simply enormous.
So, how did they manage to build such a big arts complex right in the heart of the city? Well, the area was completely destroyed by bombs during the war in 1940. So the opportunity was taken to create a cultural centre that would be, what they called: ‘the City’s gift to the Nation’. Of course, it took a while for such a big project to get started, but it was
planned (Q13)
in the 60s, built in the 70s and eventually opened to the public in
1983 (Q14)
. Ever since then it has proved to be a great success. It is not privately owned, like many arts centres, but is still in public hands – it’s run by the
City Council (Q15
)
. Both our National Symphony Orchestra and National Theatre Company were involved in the planning of the project, and they are now based there – giving regular performances every week – and as the Centre is open
363 (Q16)
days of the year, there are plenty of performances to choose from.
So, to give you some idea of what’s on, and to help you choose from the many possibilities, we’ve made a selection of the star attractions.
If you’re interested in classical music, then we recommend you go along to the National on either Monday or Tuesday evening at 7.30 for a spectacular production of ‘The Magic Flute’- probably the most popular of all Mozart’s operas. It’s in
the Garden Hall (Q17)
and tickets start at only ￡8. 00, but you’ll have to be early if you want to get them that cheap! And remember, it’s only on for those two evenings.
For those more interested in the cinema, you might like to see the new Canadian film which is showing on Wednesday evening at 8 pm in Cinema 2. And that’s called
‘Three Lives (Q18)
. ‘ It’s had fantastic reviews and tickets cost just
￡4.50 (Q19)
, which is a reduction on the usual price of ￡5. 50. So, it’s really good value, especially for such a great movie.
But you can see the centre’s main attraction at the weekend, because on Saturday and Sunday, 11 am to 10 pm, they’re showing a wonderful new exhibition that hasn’t been seen anywhere else in Europe yet. It s a collection of Chinese Art called
‘Faces of China’ (Q20)
– that’s in Gallery 1 – and it has some really fascinating paintings and sculptures by leading artists from all over China – and the good news is that it is completely free, so don’t miss it! So why not go along to the National Arts Centre next week for one – or all – of these great events – and you can always pick up a programme and check out all the other performances and exhibitions on offer, or coming soon, on almost every day of the year. Next week we’ll be looking at the new Museum of Science. . .

Thank you for calling the Tourist Line. There are many different ways of getting round the city and we’d like to suggest some you may not have thought of.
How about a city trip by boat? There are four main stopping points – from west to east: stop A Green Banks,
stop B City Bridge
, stop C Roman Landing and
stop D Newtown
.
Q11 Q12
You can find the main booking office at stop A.
The first boat leaves at 8 a.m. and the
last one at 6.30 p.m
.
There are also many attractions you can visit along the river. At Stop A, if you have time, you can visit the fine 16th century palace here built for the king with its beautiful
formal gardens
. It’s very near the booking office. Now you can enjoy every corner of this superb residence.
Q13 Q14
Stop B Why don’t you visit
Tower Restaurant
with its wide range of refreshments? This is a place where you can sit and enjoy the wonderful
views
over the old commercial and banking centre of the city.
Q15 Q16
Stop C is the area where, in the first century AD, invading soldiers crossed the river; this was much shallower than it is now. That’s why this area is called Roman Landing. There’s an interactive Museum to visit here with a large shop which has a good range of
local history books
.
Q17
At the furthest point of the trip, stop D, the most exciting place to visit is the new Entertainment Complex with
seven-screen cinema
, bowling alley and video games arcade.
Q18
Besides the boat tours, there are city buses. Two companies offer special services:
The Top Bus Company runs all its tours with a live commentary in English. Tours leave from 8.30 a.m.
every 20 minutes
. There are departures from Central Station, Castle Hill and Long Walk. This is a hop-on hop-off service and tickets are valid for 24 hours. For further details call Top Bus on 0208 9447810.
Q19

原文
ANDREW:
Good morning, Clare House Hotel. Andrew speaking. I’m the Events Manager.    Example
SAM:
Good morning, Andrew. My name’s Samantha. I’m arranging a party for my parents’ fiftieth wedding anniversary, and I’m ringing to ask about hiring a room some time next September. Also my parents and several of the guests will need accommodation.
ANDREW:
OK, I’m sure we can help you with that. Will you be having a sit-down meal or a buffet?
SAM:
Probably a sit-down.
ANDREW:
And do you know how many people there’ll be?
SAM:
Around eighty, I think.
ANDREW:
Well we have two rooms that can hold that number. One is the Adelphi Room. That can seat
eighty-five (Q1)
, or hold over a hundred if people are standing for a buffet.
SAM:
Right.
ANDREW:
If you have live music, there’s room for four or five musicians in the gallery overlooking the room. Our guests usually appreciate the fact that the music can be loud enough for dancing, but not too loud for conversation.
SAM:
Yes, I really don’t like it when you can’t talk.
ANDREW:
Exactly. Now the Adelphi Room is at the back of the hotel, and there are French windows leading out onto the terrace. This has a beautiful display of pots of
roses (Q2)
at that time of the year.
SAM:
Which direction does it face?
ANDREW:
Southwest, so that side of the hotel gets the sun in the afternoon and early evening.
SAM:
Very nice.
ANDREW:
From the terrace you can see the area of
trees (Q3)
within the grounds of the hotel, or you can stroll through there to the river – that’s on the far side, so it isn’t visible from the hotel.
SAM:
OK.
ANDREW:
Then another option is the Carlton Room. This is a bit bigger – it can hold up to a hundred and ten people – and it has the advantage of a
stage (Q4)
, which is useful if you have any entertainment, or indeed a small band can fit onto it.
SAM:
And can you go outside from the room?
ANDREW:
No, the Carlton Room is on the first floor, but on one side the windows look out onto the lake.
SAM:
Lovely. I think either of those rooms would be suitable.
ANDREW:
Can I tell you about some of the options we offer in addition?
SAM:
Please do.
ANDREW:
As well as a meal, you can have an MC, a Master of Ceremonies, who’ll be with you throughout the party.
SAM:
What exactly is the MC’s function? I suppose they make a
speech (Q5)
during the meal if we need one, do they?
ANDREW:
That’s right. All our MCs are trained as public speakers, so they can easily get people’s attention – many guests are glad to have someone who can make themselves heard above the chatter! And they’re also your
support (Q6)
– if anything goes wrong, the MC will deal with it, so you can relax.
SAM:
Great! I’ll need to ask you about food, but something else that’s important is accommodation. You obviously have rooms in the hotel, but do you also have any other accommodation, like
cabins (Q7)
, for example?
ANDREW:
Yes, there are five in the grounds, all self-contained. They each sleep two to four people and have their own living room, bathroom and small kitchen.
SAM:
That sounds perfect for what we’ll need.
SAM:
Now you have various facilities, don’t you? Are they all included in the price of hiring the room? The pool, for instance.
ANDREW:
Normally you’d be able to use it, but
it’ll be closed throughout September for refurbishment (Q8)
, I’m afraid.
The gym will be available, though, at no extra charge (Q9)
. That’s open all day, from six in the morning until midnight.
SAM:
Right.
ANDREW:
And the tennis courts, but
there is a small additional payment for those (Q10)
. We have four courts, and it’s worth booking in advance if you possibly can, as there can be quite a long waiting list for them!
SAM:
Right. Now could we discuss the food? This would be dinner, around seven o’clock…

剑桥雅思17Test4Part4听力答案解析 Maple syrup
剑桥雅思17 Test4 Part4
雅思听力
原文
Hello everyone. Today we’re going to look at another natural food product and that’s maple syrup. What is this exactly? Well, maple syrup looks rather like clear honey, but it’s not made by bees; it’s produced from the plant fluid – or sap – inside the maple tree and that makes maple syrup a very natural product. Maple syrup is a thick,
golden (Q31)
, sweet-tasting liquid that can be bought in bottles or jars and poured onto food such as waffles and ice cream or used in the baking of cakes and pastries. It contains no preservatives or added ingredients, and it provides a
healthy (Q32)
alternative to refined sugar.
Let’s just talk a bit about the maple tree itself, which is where maple syrup comes from. So, there are many species of maple tree, and they’ll grow without fertilizer in areas where there’s plenty of moisture in the soil. However, they’ll only do this if another important criterion is fulfilled, which is that they must have full or partial sun exposure during the day and very cool nights – and I’ll talk more about that in a minute. There are only certain parts of the world that provide all these conditions: one is Canada, and by that, I mean all parts of Canada, and the other is the north-eastern states of North America. In these areas, the
climate (Q33)
suits the trees perfectly. In fact, Canada produces over two-thirds of the world’s maple syrup, which is why the five-pointed maple leaf is a Canadian symbol and has featured on the flag since 1964.
So how did maple syrup production begin? Well, long before Europeans settled in these parts of the world, the indigenous communities had started producing maple sugar. They bored holes in the trunks of maple trees and used containers made of tree bark to collect the liquid sap as it poured out. As they were unable to keep the liquid for any length of time – they didn’t have storage facilities in those days – they boiled the liquid by placing pieces of
rock (Q34)
that had become scorching hot from the sun into the sap. They did this until it turned into sugar, and they were then able to use this to sweeten their food and drinks. Since that time, improvements have been made to the process, but it has changed very little overall.
So let’s look at the production of maple syrup today. Clearly, the maple forests are a valuable resource in many Canadian and North American communities. The trees have to be well looked after and they cannot be used to make syrup until the trunks reach a
diameter (Q35)
of around 25 centimetres. This can take anything up to 40 years. As I’ve already mentioned, maple trees need the right conditions to grow and also to produce sap. Why is this? Well, what happens is that during a cold night, the tree absorbs water from the soil, and that rises through the tree’s vascular system. But then in the warmer daytime, the change in temperature causes the water to be pushed back down to the bottom of the tree. This continual movement – up and down – leads to the formation of the sap needed for maple syrup production.
When the tree is ready, it can be tapped and this involves drilling a small hole into the trunk and inserting a
tube (Q36)
into it that ends in a bucket. The trees can often take several taps, though the workers take care not to cause any damage to the healthy growth of the tree itself. The sap that comes out of the trees consists of 98 percent water and 2 percent sugar and other nutrients. It has to be boiled so that much of that water evaporates, and this process as to take place immediately, using what are called evaporators. These are basically extremely large pans – the sap is poured into these, a
fire (Q37)
is built and the pans are then heated until the sap boils. As it does this, the water evaporates, and the syrup begins to form. The evaporation process creates large quantities of
steam (Q38)
, and the sap becomes thicker and denser, and, at just the right moment, when the sap is thick enough to be called maple syrup, the worker removes it from the heat. After this process, something called ‘sugar sand’ has to be filtered out as this builds up during the boiling and gives the syrup a
cloudy (Q39)
appearance and a slightly gritty taste. Once this has been done, the syrup is ready to be packaged so that it can be used for a whole variety of products. It takes 40
litres
of sap to produce one
litre
(Q40)
of maple syrup so you can get an idea of how much is needed!
So that’s the basic process. In places like Quebec where …

剑桥雅思8Test1听力Section4答案解析 Geography
剑8 test 1 Section 4
雅思听力
原文
So, welcome to your introductory geography lecture. We’ll begin with some basics. Firstly, what do we learn by studying geography?
Well, we learn a great deal about all the processes that have affected and that continue to affect the earth’s
surface
(
Q31
). But we learn far more than that, because studying geography also informs us about the different kinds of relationships that develop between a particular
environment
(
Q32
) and the people that live there.
Okay. We like to think of geography as having two main branches. There’s the study of the nature of our planet – its physical features, what it actually looks like – and then there’s the study of the ways in which we choose to live and of the
impact
(
Q33
) of those on our planet. Our current use of carbon fuels is a good example of that.
But there are more specific study areas to consider too, and we’ll be looking at each of these in turn throughout this semester. These include bio-physical geography, by which I mean the study of the natural environment and all its living things. Then there’s topography – that looks at the shapes of the land and oceans. There’s the study of political geography and social geography too, of course, which is the study of communities of people. We have economic geography – in which we examine all kinds of resources and their use in agriculture, for example. Next comes historical geography – the understanding of how people and their environments and the ways they interact have changed over a period of time – and
urban
(
Q34
) geography, an aspect I’m particularly interested in, which takes as its focus the location of cities, the services that those cities provide, and migration of people to and from such cities. And lastly, we have cartography. That’s the art and science of mapmaking. You’ll be doing a lot of that!
So, to summarise before we continue, we now have our key answer. . . studying this subject is important because without geographical knowledge, we would know very little about our surroundings and we wouldn’t be able to identify all the
problems
(
Q35
) that relate to them. So, by definition, we wouldn’t be in an informed position to work out how to solve any of them.
Okay, now for some practicalities. What do geographers actually do? Well, we collect data to begin with! You’ll be doing a lot of that on your first field trip! How do we do this? There are several means. We might, for example, conduct a census – count a population in a given area perhaps. We also need
images
(
Q36
) of the earth’s surface which we can produce by means of computer-generation technology or with the help of satellite relays. We’ve come a very long way from the early exploration of the world by sailing ships when geographers only had pens and paper at their disposal.
After we’ve gathered our information, we must analyze it! We need to look for
patterns
(
Q37
), most commonly those of causes and consequences. This kind of information helps us to predict and resolve problems that could affect the world we live in.
But we don’t keep all this information confidential. We then need to publish our findings so that other people can access it and be informed by it. And one way in which this information can be published is in the form of maps. You’ll all have used one at some stage of your life already. Let’s consider the benefits of maps from a geographer’s perspective.
Maps can be folded and put in a pocket and can provide a great store of reference when they’re collected into an atlas. They can depict the physical features of the entire planet if necessary, or, just a small part of it in much greater detail. But there is a drawback. You can’t exactly replicate something that is three-dimensional, like our planet, on a flat piece of paper, because paper has only two dimensions, and that means there’ll always be a certain degree of
distortion
(
Q38
) on a map. It can’t be avoided.
We can also use aerial photographs. . , pictures taken by cameras at high altitude above the earth. These are great for showing all kinds of geographical features that are not easy to see from the ground. You can easily illustrate areas of diseased trees or how much
traffic
(
Q39
)is on the roads at a given time or information about deep sea beds, for example.
Then there are Landsats. These are satellites that circle the earth and transmit visual information to computers at receiving stations. They circle the earth several times a day and can provide a mass of information – you’ll all be familiar with the information they give us about the
weather
(
Q40
), for example.
So, what we’re going to do now is look at a short presentation in which you’ll see all these tools. . .

原文
Tonight I’m going to talk to you about that remarkable continent Antarctica – remote, hostile and at present uninhabited on a permanent basis. For early explorers, it was the ultimate survival contest; for researchers like me, it remains a place of great intellectual challenge; while for the modern tourist, it’s simply a wilderness of great beauty.
First, some facts and figures. Antarctica is a place of extremes – the highest, coldest and windiest continent and over
fifty-eight
times the size of the UK. The ice-cap contains almost 70% of the world’s fresh water and 90% of its ice, but with very low snowfall, most of the continent technically falls unbelievably into the category of ‘
desert
’! Huge icebergs break off the continent each year, while in winter half the surrounding ocean freezes over, which means its size almost doubles.
Q31, Q32
Research and exploration has been going on in Antarctica for more than two hundred years, and has involved scientists from many different countries, who work together on research stations. Here
science
and technical support have been integrated in a very cost-effective way – our Antarctic research programme has several summers-only stations and two all-year-round ones; I was based on one of the all-year-round ones.
Q33
The research stations are really self-contained communities of about twenty people. There’s living and working space, a kitchen with a huge food store, a
small hospital
and a well-equipped gym to ensure everyone keeps fit in their spare time. The station generates its own electricity and communicates with the outside world using a satellite link.
Q34
Our station – Zero One – had some special features. It wasn’t built on land but on an ice-shelf, hundreds of metres thick. Supplies were brought to us on large sledges from a
ship
fifteen kilometres away at the ice edge.
Q35
Living in the Antarctic hasn’t always been so comfortable. Snow build-ups caused enormous problems for four previous stations on the same site, which were buried and finally crushed by the weight. Fortunately no-one was hurt, but these buildings became a huge challenge to architects who finally came up with a remarkable solution – the buildings are placed on
platforms
which can be raised above the changing snow level on legs which are extendable.
Q36
Food is one of the most important aspects of survival in a polar climate. People living there need to obtain a lot more energy from their food, both to keep warm and to undertake heavy physical work. . Maybe you know that an adult in the UK will probably need about 1,700 kilocalories a day on average; someone in Antarctica will need about
3,500
-just over double! This energy is provided by foods which are high in carbohydrate and fat.
Q37
Rations for fieldwork present an additional problem. They need to provide maximum energy, but they must also be compact and light for easy transport. Special boxes are prepared, each containing enough food for one person for twenty days. You may be familiar with coffee processed by freeze-drying, which preserves the quality of the food product while making a large saving in weight – well, this type of presentation is ideal in our situation. It wasn’t available to earlier polar explorers, whose diet was commonly insufficient for their health.
I think that being at the cutting edge of science has a special appeal for everyone working in Antarctica, in whatever capacity. As a marine biologist, my own research was fascinating; but it’s perhaps climate change research that is the most crucial field of study.
Within this general field, surveying changes in the volume and stability of the ice-cap is vital, since these may have profound effects on world sea levels and on
ocean currents
. A second important area is monitoring the size of the hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica, since this is an indicator of global ultra-violet radiation levels. Thirdly, bubbles in the ice-sheet itself provide an index of
pollution
because frozen inside them are samples of previous atmospheres over the past 500,000 years, and these provide us with evidence for the effects of such human activities as agriculture and industry.
Q38, Q39
There are an increasing number of opportunities for
young
people to work for a period in Antarctica – not only as research assistants in projects like mine, but also in a wide range of junior administrative and technical positions including vacancies for map-makers. I hope that the insights I’ve provided will encourage you to take up these opportunities in this fascinating continent.

原文
JACK:
I’ve still got loads to do for our report on nutritional food labels.
ALICE:
Me too. What did you learn from doing the project about your own shopping habits?
JACK:
Well, I’ve always had to check labels for traces of peanuts in everything I eat because of my allergy. But beyond that
I’ve never really been concerned enough to check how healthy a product is (Q21)
.
ALICE:
This project has actually taught me to read the labels much more carefully.
I tended to believe claims on packaging like ‘low in fat’. But I now realise that the ‘healthy’ yoghurt I’ve bought for years is full of sugar and that it’s actually quite high in calories (Q22)
.
JACK:
Ready meals are the worst… comparing the labels on supermarket pizzas was a real eye-opener. Did you have any idea how many calories they contain? I was amazed.
ALICE:
Yes, because
unless you read the label really carefully, you wouldn’t know that the nutritional values given are for half a pizza (Q23)
.
JACK:
When most people eat the whole pizza. Not exactly transparent is it?
ALICE:
Not at all. But I expect it won’t stop you from buying pizza?
JACK:
Probably not, no! I thought comparing the different labelling systems used by food manufacturers was interesting. I think the kind of labelling system used makes a big difference.
ALICE:
Which one did you prefer?
JACK:
I liked the traditional daily value system best – the one which tells you what proportion of your required daily intake of each ingredient the product contains.
I’m not sure it’s the easiest for people to use but at least you get the full story (Q24)
. I like to know all the ingredients in a product – not just how much fat, salt and sugar they contain.
ALICE:
But it’s good supermarkets have been making an effort to provide reliable information for customers.
JACK:
Yes. There just needs to be more consistency between labelling systems used by different supermarkets, in terms of portion sizes, etc.
ALICE:
Mmm. The labels on the different brands of chicken flavour crisps were quite revealing too, weren’t they?
JACK:
Yeah.
I don’t understand how they can get away with calling them chicken flavour when they only contain artificial additives
.
ALICE:
I know.
I’d at least have expected them to contain a small percentage of real chicken (Q25)
.
JACK:
Absolutely.
ALICE:
I think having nutritional food labeling has been a good idea, don’t you? I think it will change people’s behaviour and stop mothers, in particular, buying the wrong things.
JACK:
But didn’t that study kind of prove the opposite? People didn’t necessarily stop buying unhealthy products.
ALICE:
They only said that might be the case.
Those findings weren’t that conclusive (Q26)
and it was quite a small-scale study. I think more research has to be done.
JACK:
Yes, I think you’re probably right.
JACK:
What do you think of the traffic-light system?
ALICE:
I think supermarkets like the idea of having a colour-coded system – red, orange or green – for levels of fat, sugar and salt in a product.
JACK:
But it’s not been adopted universally
. And not on all products. Why do you suppose that is?
ALICE:
Pressure from the food manufacturers. Hardly surprising that some of them are opposed to flagging up how unhealthy their products are.
JACK:
I’d have thought it would have been compulsory. It seems ridiculous it isn’t (Q27)
.
ALICE:
I know.
And what I couldn’t get over is the fact that it was brought in without enough consultation (Q28)
– a lot of experts had deep reservations about it.
JACK:
That is a bit weird. I suppose there’s an argument for doing the research now when consumers are familiar with this system.
ALICE:
Yeah, maybe.
JACK:
The participants in the survey were quite positive about the traffic-light system.
ALICE:
Mmm. But I don’t think they targeted the right people. They should have focused on people with low literacy levels because these labels are designed to be accessible to them.
JACK:
Yeah.
But it’s good to get feedback from all socio-economic groups (Q29)
. And there wasn’t much variation in their responses.
ALICE:
No. But
if they hadn’t interviewed participants face-to-face, they could have used a much bigger sample size (Q30)
. I wonder why they chose that method?
JACK:
Dunno. How were they selected? Did they volunteer or were they approached?
ALICE:
I think they volunteered. The thing that wasn’t stated was how often they bought packaged food – all we know is how frequently they used the supermarket.

剑4 test 2 Section 4
雅思听力
原文
So far, in these lectures, we’ve been looking at crimes like robbery and murder – both from a historical viewpoint and also in contemporary society – and we’ve seen that the preoccupation in Western society with crime and with lawlessness is part of a long and continuous tradition, rather than something which is new and unique to modern society.
But over the past seventy years or so, there has been a massive increase in one type of crime, which is what’s known as ‘corporate crime’.
Corporate crime is crime which, as the name suggests, is connected with
companies, with business organizations
.
It includes illegal acts of either individuals or a group within the company, but what is important is that these acts are normally in accordance with the goals of the company – they’re for the good of the company rather than the individual. It’s been defined as, quote, ‘crime which is committed for the corporate organization’ – the company – ‘not against it’, unquote.
Q31
So
crimes like theft by employees – things like embezzlement or fraud against one’s actual employer are excluded according to this definition
. The employees may be involved but they’re acting in the first place for the company – they may not even realize they’re committing a crime or they may realize but they feel it’s excusable because it’s policy, or because otherwise, they may lose their jobs. So here, really, we’re talking about the links between power and crime.
Q32
Now, this is one area that much less is generally known about than conventional or traditional crime. It has been relatively ignored by the
mass media
– for example, it tends to be under-reported in comparison with conventional crime in news broadcasts, and in crime serials and films and so on – they very rarely deal with corporate crime. And it also tends to be ignored in
academic circles
– there’s been far more research on conventional crime and far more data is available.
Q33 Q34
There are several reasons for this lack of interest in corporate crime, compared with other types of crime. It’s often very complex, whereas with conventional crime it’s usually possible to follow what’s going on without
specialist knowledge
. As well as this, whereas conventional crime usually has a lot of human interest, corporate crime often has much less. The third reason, and possibly the most significant one, is that very often the victims are unaware – they think their misfortune is an accident or that it’s the fault of no-one in particular. They’re
unaware
that they’ve been victims of a crime.
Q35 Q36
So, when we look at the effects of corporate crime we may find it’s very difficult to assess the costs. But these costs can be very considerable in both their economic and social aspects.
Let’s look at the economic costs first. For example, if a company is producing fruit juice and it dilutes its product so that it’s just a little below the concentration it should be, many millions of people may be paying a small amount extra for their carton of orange juice. Now small amounts like this may seem insignificant for
individual customers
– too small to worry about – but for the company, this deception might result in massive
illegal profit
. However, all studies of corporate crime agree that the individuals are in fact deprived of far more money by such crime than they are by conventional crime like robbery and theft.
Q37 Q38
In addition to this, we have to consider the social costs of corporate crime and these are again very difficult to assess, but they are considerable. They’re important because they can undermine the faith of the public in the business world and also, more importantly, because the main group of people they affect are, in fact, not the richer sections of society but the poorer – so here companies are robbing the poor to benefit the rich.
There are two more points to do with corporate crime that I’d like to illustrate with reference to a specific event which occurred several years ago. This was an explosion of a large oil tanker which caused the loss of more than fifty lives of the crew. It was an explosion which never should have happened and a subsequent inquiry laid the blame not on anyone who had actually been on the tanker at the time, but on the owners of the tanker. They had deliberately decided not to carry out necessary repair work on the tanker as it was due to be sold, and it was this lack of repair work which was directly responsible for the explosion.
Now, this illustrates two points to do with corporate crime. First of all, that it does not have to be intentional. The owners of the tanker certainly did not intend it to explode. But very serious consequences can result from people or organizations not considering the possible results of their actions seriously enough. The main crime here was
indifference to the human results rather than the actual intention to harm anyone. but that didn’t make the results any less tragic
.
Q39 & Q40
And this leads me to my second point – that corporate crime can have very severe consequences. It’s not just a matter of companies making bigger profits than they should do, but of events which may affect the lives of innocent people, and yet very often companies, because they say they didn’t intend to harm anyone, can avoid taking responsibility for the results of their actions. And that has been a very dangerous loophole in the law.
A further example of corporate crime was… (fade out)

Could you send me a brochure?
TRAVEL AGENT
: Of course. Could I have your name please?
ANDREA
: Andrea Brown.
TRAVEL AGENT
: Thank you. And your address?
ANDREA

Ardleigh (Q1)
Road.

TRAVEL AGENT
: Postcode?
ANDREA
: BH5 2OP.
TRAVEL AGENT
: Thanks. And can I have your phone number?
ANDREA
: Is a mobile alright?
TRAVEL AGENT
: Fine.
ANDREA
: It’s 07786643091.
TRAVEL AGENT
: Thank you. And can I ask you where you heard about World Tours?
From a friend? Or did you see an advert somewhere?
ANDREA
: No, I read about you in the
newspaper (Q2)
.
TRAVEL AGENT
: OK, I’ll get the brochures in the post to you but can I give you some information over the phone.
What kinds of things do you want to do on your holiday?
ANDREA
: I’m interested in going to California with my family.
I’ve got two children and we want to hire a car.
TRAVEL AGENT
: OK.
We have a couple of self-drive tours there visiting different places of interest in California.
The first one begins in Los Angeles and there’s plenty of time to visit some of the
theme
(Q3)
parks there.
ANDREA
: That’s something on my children’s list so I’d want to include that.
TRAVEL AGENT
: Good.
Then you drive to San Francisco.
From San Francisco you can drive to Yosemite Park where you spend a couple of nights.
You can choose to stay in a lodge or on the
campsite
.
ANDREA
: I don’t like the idea of staying in a
tent (Q4)
.
It’d be too hot.
TRAVEL AGENT
: Right. And the tour ends in Las Vegas.
ANDREA
: OK.
TRAVEL AGENT
: The other trip we can arrange is slightly different.
It starts in San Francisco.
Then you drive south to Cambria.
ANDREA
: Someone told me there’s a really nice
castle (Q5)
near Cambria.
Will we go near that?
TRAVEL AGENT
: Hearst Castle is on that road so you could stop there.
ANDREA
: Good. I’d like to do that.
Does this trip also go into the desert?
TRAVEL AGENT
: No, it continues to Santa Monica where most people like to stop and do some shopping.
ANDREA
: We have enough of that at home so that doesn’t interest us.
TRAVEL AGENT
: OK. Well, you could go straight on to San Diego.
ANDREA
: That’s good for
beaches (Q6)
isn’t it?
TRAVEL AGENT
: That’s right, that’s a good place to relax and your children might like to visit the zoo before flying home.
ANDREA
: I don’t think so.
We want some time for sunbathing and swimming.
ANDREA
: So how many days are the trips and how much do they cost?
TRAVEL AGENT
: The first one I told you about is a self-drive tour through California which lasts twelve days and covers
2020 (Q7)
kilometres.
The shortest journey is 206 km and the longest is 632 kilometres.
The cost is £525 per person.
That includes
accommodation
, car rental and a
flight (Q8)
but no meals.
ANDREA
: OK. And the other trip?
TRAVEL AGENT
: That lasts nine days but you spend only three days on the road.
You cover about 980 kilometres
altogether
.
ANDREA
: So is that cheaper then?
TRAVEL AGENT
: Yes, it’s almost a hundred pounds cheaper.
It’s £
429 (Q9)
per person, which is a good deal.
ANDREA
: So that covers
accommodation
and car hire.
What about flights?
TRAVEL AGENT
: They aren’t included.
But these hotels offer
dinner (Q10)
in the price.
ANDREA
: OK. Well, thank you very much.
I’ll be in touch when I’ve had a chance to look at the brochure.
TRAVEL AGENT
: I’m pleased to help. Goodbye.
ANDREA
: Bye.

原文
JESS:
How are you getting on with your art project, Tom?
TOM:
OK. Like, they gave us the theme of birds to base our project on, and I’m not really all that interested in wildlife. But I’m starting to get into it. I’ve pretty well finished the introductory stage.
JESS:
So have I.
When they gave us all those handouts with details of books and websites to look at, I was really put off, but the more I read, the more interested I got (Q21)
.
TOM:
Me too. I found I could research so many different aspects of birds in art – colour, movement, texture. So I was looking forward to the Bird Park visit.
JESS:
What a letdown! It poured with rain and we hardly saw a single bird.
Much less use than the trip to the Natural History Museum (Q22)
.
TOM:
Yeah. I liked all the stuff about evolution there. The workshop sessions with Dr Fletcher were good too, especially the brainstorming sessions.
JESS:
I missed those because I was ill. I wish we could’ve seen the projects last year’s students did.
TOM:
Mm. I suppose they want us to do our own thing, not copy.
JESS:
Have you drafted your proposal yet?
TOM:
Yes, but I haven’t handed it in. I need to amend some parts. I’ve realised the notes from my research are almost all just descriptions,
I haven’t actually evaluated anything. So I’ll have to fix that (Q23)
.
JESS:
Oh, I didn’t know we had to do that. I’ll have to look at that too. Did you do a timeline for the project?
TOM:
Yes, and a mind map.
JESS:
Yeah, so did I. I quite enjoyed that. But it was hard having to explain the basis for my decisions in my action plan.
TOM:
What?
JESS:
You know, give a rationale
TOM:
I didn’t realise we had to do that. OK. I can add it now. And I’ve done the video diary presentation, and worked out what I want my outcome to be in the project.
JESS:
Someone told me
it’s best not to be too precise about your actual outcome at this stage (Q24)
, so you have more scope to explore your ideas later on. So I’m going to go back to my proposal to make it a bit more vague.
TOM:
Really? OK. I’ll change that too then.
TOM:
One part of the project I’m unsure about is where we choose some paintings of birds and say what they mean to us. Like, I chose a painting of a falcon by Landseer. I like it because the bird’s standing there with his head turned to one side, but he seems to be staring straight at you. But I can’t just say it’s a bit scary, can I?
JESS:
You could talk about the possible danger suggested by the bird’s look (Q25)
.
TOM:
Oh, OK.
JESS:
There’s a picture of a fish hawk by Audubon I like. It’s swooping over the water with a fish in its talons, and with great black wings which take up most of the picture
TOM:
So you could discuss it in relation to predators and food chains?
JESS:
Well actually I think
I’ll concentrate on the impression of rapid motion it gives (Q26)
.
TOM:
Right.
JESS:
Do you know that picture of a kingfisher by van Gogh – it’s perching on a reed growing near a stream
TOM:
Yes it’s got these beautiful blue and red and black shades
JESS:
Mm hm. I’ve actually chosen it because I saw a real kingfisher once
when I was little. I was out walking with my grandfather (Q27)
, and I’ve never forgotten it
TOM:
So we can use a personal link?
JESS:
Sure
TOM:
OK. There’s a portrait called William Wells, I can’t remember the artist but it’s a middle-aged man who’s just shot a bird. And his expression, and the way he’s holding the bird in his hand suggests he’s not sure about what he’s done.
To me it’s about how ambiguous people are in the way they exploit the natural world (Q28)
.
JESS:
Interesting. There’s Gauguin’s picture Vairumati. He did it in Tahiti. It’s a woman with a white bird behind her that is eating a lizard, and what I’m interested in is what idea this bird refers to. Apparently,
it’s a reference to the never-ending cycle of existence (Q29)
.
TOM:
Wow. I chose a portrait of a little boy. Giovanni de Medici.
He’s holding a tiny bird in one fist. I like the way he’s holding it carefully so he doesn’t hurt it (Q30)
.
JESS:
Ah right.

剑7 test 4 Section 2
雅思听力
原文
Welcome to all of you… can everybody see and hear me?… Good… I’m Sally, your guide for this tour of the Bicentennial Park…
I hope that you’re all wearing your most comfortable shoes and that you can keep up the pace
. So let’s get under way on our tour around this wonderful park.
Q11
I’ll start today with some general background information. There
used to be a lot of factories
in this area until the 1960s. Creating the park required the demolition of lots of derelict buildings on the site, so most of the exciting park space all around you was originally
warehouses and storehouses
.
Q12
The idea of building a public park here was first discussed when a property developer proposed a high-rise housing development, but the local community wasn’t happy. If the land was to be cleaned up,
they wanted to use the site for recreation. Residents wanted open space for outdoor activities, rather than housing or even an indoor sports complex
.
Q13
Now to the Bicentennial Park itself. It has two areas, a nature reserve and a formal park with man-made features and gardens. The tall blue-and-white building in front of us is called The Tower and
is the centre point for the formal gardens
. It stands twelve metres high, so follow me up the stairs to where we can take advantage of the fantastic views.
Q14
Well, here we are at the top of The Tower, and we’re going to look at the view from each direction. Out to the east, the large buildings about a kilometre away are on the Olympic site. There’s an indoor arena for gymnastics, a stadium for track and field and a swimming pool for races and synchronised swimming and also diving. If you look carefully down there, you can see the train lines. The Olympic site has its own station to encourage the use of public transport.
There is also a
car park
, but it only holds a limited number of cars.
Q15
The formal park has some specially-created water features. If you look out here to the south, you can see a circular ornamental pond.
And around to the west, you can relax and sit on a bench to smell the flowers in the
rose garden
, and finally up to the north, if you look in front of you now, there’s a lake with a small island in the centre, you can hire rowing boats at the boat shed, which you can’t see from here, but if you look through the trees, you can see the
café
, which has lovely views across the water. OK, let’s climb down now. We will go now and have a look at the nature reserve section of the park, which has opened up natural wetland to the public.
Q16 Q17
The Mangroves have been made more accessible to visitors by the boardwalk built during the park’s upgrade. You’d think that people would come here to look at the unusual plant life of the area, but in fact it’s more often used for
cycling
and is very popular with the local clubs. This is the far end of the park and over there you can see the Frog Pond, a natural feature here long before the park was designed. Just next to it we have our outdoor classroom, a favourite spot for school parties. The area is now most often used by primary schools for
biology lessons
.
Q18 Q19
And finally let’s pass by the Waterbird Refuge. This area is in a sheltered part of the estuary, that’s why the park’s
viewing shelter
is a favourite spot for bird watchers who can use it to spy through binoculars. You can watch a variety of water birds, but most visitors expect to see black swans when they come to the shelter. You might spot one yourself right now!
Q20
Well, here we are back at our starting point, the Visitor Centre.

MAN:
Greek Island Holidays, can I help you?
WOMAN:
Yes, I hope so. I have a friend who’s just come back from Corfu and she’s recommended some apartments in Arilas. She thought they might be on your list.
MAN:
Arilas, Arilas, let me see. Can you give me the names?
WOMAN:
Yes, the first’s Rose Garden Apartments. I’d like to go with another friend in the last week of October.
MAN:
Well, we’ve got a lovely studio flat available at that time. I’m sure you’d enjoy the entertainment programme there too, with
Greek dancing (Example)
in the restaurant.
WOMAN:
And the cost for each of us?
MAN:
£219.
WOMAN:
That sounds very reasonable! I’m just jotting down some notes. Now the second one she mentioned was called Blue Bay.
MAN:
Blue Bay? Yes, in fact that’s very popular and it has some special features.
WOMAN:
Really?
MAN:
The main attraction is the large swimming pool with salt water.
WOMAN:
Much healthier, I understand.
MAN:
That’s right. And it isn’t far from the beach, either- only
300 metres (Q1)
, and only around half a kilometre to some shops, so you don’t have to be too energetic.
WOMAN:
Is it much more expensive than the first one?
MAN:
Let me just check. I think at the time you want to go it’s around £260 – no £275 to be exact.
WOMAN:
Right, I’ve got that. Now there are just two more apartments to ask you about. Um, I can’t read my own writing! Something to do with sun … Sunshine, is it?
MAN:
I think you meant the
Sunshade (Q2)
Apartments. They’re on a mountainside.
WOMAN:
Any special features?
MAN:
Yes, each room has its own sun terrace and there are shared barbecue facilities.
WOMAN:
Sounds lovely!
MAN:
Yes, it is rather well-equipped. It also provides water sports – it has its own beach. There are facilities for water-skiing.
WOMAN:
Any kite-surfing? My friend’s quite keen.
MAN:
Not at the hotel but I’m sure you’ll find some in Arilas. There’s also satellite TV in the apartments.
WOMAN:
And how much is that one?
MAN:
£490 with two sharing.
WOMAN:
You mean £245 each?
MAN:
I’m afraid not! Each person has to pay that amount and there must be at least two in an apartment.
WOMAN:
I don’t think that would be within our budget, unfortunately. And the last one sounds a bit expensive too – the Grand!
MAN:
Actually it’s quite reasonable. It’s an older style house with Greek paintings in every room, and a
balcony (Q3)
outside.
WOMAN:
Sounds nice. What are the views like?
MAN:
Well, there are
forests (Q4)
all round and they hide a supermarket just down the road, so that’s very useful for all your shopping needs. There’s a disco in the area too.
WOMAN:
And the price?
MAN:
£319 (Q5)
at that time, but if you leave it till November it goes down by 40%.
WOMAN:
Too late, I’m afraid.
MAN:
Well, why don’t I send you a brochure with full details, Ms … ?
WOMAN:
Nash. But don’t worry about that. I’m coming to Upminster soon and I’ll call and get one. I just wanted to get an idea first.
MAN:
Well, that’s fine. We’ve got plenty here when you come.
WOMAN:
If you’ve got a minute, could I just check a couple of points about insurance? I got one policy through the post but I’d like to see if yours is better.
MAN:
Fine. What would you like to know?
WOMAN:
Well, the one I’ve got has benefits and then the maximum amount you can claim. Is that like yours?
MAN:
Yes, that’s how most of them are.
WOMAN:
Well, the first thing is cancellation. If the holiday’s cancelled on the policy I’ve got, you can claim £8,000.
MAN:
We can improve on that, Ms Nash. For Greek Island holidays, our maximum is
£10,000 (Q6)
.
WOMAN:
That’s good – of course our holiday won’t even cost £1,000 together!
MAN:
It’s still sensible to have good cover. Now, if you go to hospital, we allow £600.
WOMAN:
Yes, mine’s similar.
MAN:
And we also allow a
relative
(Q7)
to travel to your holiday resort.
WOMAN:
My policy just says their representative will help you.
MAN:
You can see there’s another difference there. And what happens if you don’t get on the plane?
WOMAN:
Nothing, as far as I can see on this form.
MAN:
Don’t you have
missed (Q8)
departure?
WOMAN:
No, I’ll just jot that down.
MAN:
We pay up to £1,000 for that, depending on the reason. And we’re particularly generous about loss of personal belongings – up to £3,000, but not more than £500 for a single
item
(Q9)
.
WOMAN:
Then I’d better not take my laptop!
MAN:
Not unless you insure it separately.
WOMAN:
OK – thanks very much for your time – you’ve really been helpful. Can I get back to you? Your name is?
MAN:
Ben –
Ludlow. That’s L-U-D-L-O-W (Q10)
. I’m the Assistant Manager here. I’ll give you my number. It’s 081260 543216.
WOMAN:
But didn’t I phone 081260 567294? That’s what I’ve got on the paper.
MAN:
That’s the main switchboard. I’ve given you my direct line.
WOMAN:
Right, thank you …

原文
So if you’re one of those people who hasn’t found the perfect physical activity yet – here are some things to think about which might help you make the right decision for you.
The first question to ask yourself is whether you would enjoy training in a gym. Many people are put off by the idea of having to fit a visit to the gym into their busy day – you often have to go very early or late as some gyms can get very crowded.
But with regular training you’ll see a big difference in a relatively short space of time (Q11)
.
Running has become incredibly popular in recent years. That’s probably got a lot to do with the fact that
it’s a very accessible form of exercise – anyone can run – even if you can only run a few metres to begin with
(Q12)
. But make sure you get the right shoes – it’s worth investing in a high quality pair and they don’t come cheap. Another great thing about running is that you can do it at any time of day or night – the only thing that may stop you is snow and ice.
Swimming is another really good way to build fitness. What attracts many people is that
you can swim in an indoor pool at any time of year (Q13)
. On the other hand, it can be quite boring or solitary – it’s hard to chat to people while you’re swimming lengths.
Cycling has become almost as popular as running in recent years. That’s probably because as well as improving their fitness,
many people say being out in the fresh air in a park or in the countryside can be fun (Q14)
, provided the conditions are right, of course – only fanatics go out in the wind and rain!
Yoga is a good choice for those of you looking for exercise which focuses on developing both a healthy mind and body. It’s a good way of building strength and with the right instructor,
there’s less chance of hurting yourself than with other more active sports (Q15)
. But don’t expect to find it easy – it can be surprisingly challenging, especially for people who aren’t very flexible.
Getting a personal trainer is a good way to start your fitness programme. Obviously there can be significant costs involved.
But if you’ve got someone there to encourage you and help you achieve your goals, you’re less likely to give up (Q16)
. Make sure you get someone with a recognised qualification, though, or you could do yourself permanent damage.
Whatever you do, don’t join a gym unless you’re sure you’ll make good use of it. So many people waste lots of money by signing up for membership and then hardly ever go. What happens to their good intentions? I don’t think people suddenly stop caring about improving their fitness, or decide they have more important things to do.
I think people lose interest when they don’t think they’re making enough progress (Q17)
. That’s when they give up hope and stop believing they’ll ever achieve their goals. Also,
what people sometimes don’t realise when they start is that it takes a lot of determination and hard work to keep training week after week (Q18)
and lots of people don’t have that kind of commitment.
One thing you can do to help yourself is to set manageable goals –
be realistic and don’t push yourself too far (Q19)
. Some people advise writing goals down, but I think it’s better to have a flexible approach.
Give yourself a really nice treat every time you reach one of your goals (Q20)
. And don’t get too upset if you experience setbacks – it’s a journey – there are bound to be difficulties along the way.

剑桥雅思16Test4Part3听力答案解析 bike-sharing schemes
剑桥雅思16 Test4 Part3
雅思听力
原文
JAKE:
Now that we’ve done all the research into bike-sharing schemes in cities around the world, we need to think about how we’re going to organise our report.
AMY:
Right. I think we should start by talking about the benefits. I mean it’s great that so many cities have introduced these schemes where anyone can pick up a bike from dozens of different locations and hire it for a few hours. It makes riding a bike very convenient for people
JAKE:
Yes, but the costs can add up and that puts people on low incomes off in some places.
AMY:
I suppose so, but if it means more people in general are cycling rather than driving, then because they’re increasing the amount of physical activity they do, it’s good for their health.
JAKE:
OK. But isn’t that of less importance? I mean,
doesn’t the impact of reduced emissions on air pollution have a more significant effect (Q21)
on people’s health?
AMY:
Certainly, in some cities bike-sharing has made a big contribution to that. And
also helped to cut the number of cars on the road significantly (Q22)
.
JAKE:
Which is the main point.
AMY:
Exactly. But I’d say it’s had less of an impact on noise pollution because there are still loads of buses and lorries around.
JAKE:
Right.
AMY:
Shall we quickly discuss the recommendations we’re going to make?
JAKE:
In order to ensure bike-sharing schemes are successful?
AMY:
Yes.
JAKE:
OK. Well, while I think it’s nice to have really state-of-the-art bikes with things like GPS, I wouldn’t say they’re absolutely necessary.
AMY:
But some technical things are really important – like a fully functional app – so people can make payments and book bikes easily (Q23)
. Places which haven’t invested in that have really struggled.
JAKE:
Good point … Some people say there shouldn’t be competing companies offering separate bike-sharing schemes, but in some really big cities, competition’s beneficial and anyway one company might not be able to manage the whole thing
AMY:
Right. Deciding how much to invest is a big question. Cities which have opened loads of new bike lanes at the same time as introducing bike-sharing schemes have generally been more successful – but there are examples of successful schemes where this hasn’t happened …
What does matter though – is having a big publicity campaign (Q24)
.
JAKE:
Definitely. If people don’t know how to use the scheme or don’t understand its benefits, they won’t use it. People need a lot of persuasion to stop using their cars.
AMY:
Shall we look at some examples now? And say what we think is good or bad about them.
JAKE:
I suppose we should start with Amsterdam as this was one of the first cities to have a bike-sharing scheme.
AMY:
Yes. There was already a strong culture of cycling here, In a way
it’s strange that there was such a demand for bike-sharing because you’d have thought most people would have used their own bikes.
JAKE:
And
yet it’s one of the best-used schemes (Q25)
… Dublin’s an interesting example of a success story.
AMY:
It must be because the public transport system’s quite limited
JAKE:
Not really
– there’s no underground. but there are trams and a good bus network.
I’d say price has a lot to do with it (Q26)
. It’s one of the cheapest schemes in Europe to join.
AMY:
But the buses are really slow – anyway the weather certainly can’t be a factor
JAKE:
No – definitely not. The London scheme’s been quite successful.
AMY:
Yes – it’s been a really good thing for the city. The bikes are popular and the whole system is well maintained but it isn’t expanding quickly enough.
JAKE:
Basically,
not enough’s been spent on increasing the number of cycle lanes (Q27)
. Hopefully that’ll change.
AMY:
Yes. Now what about outside Europe?
JAKE:
Well bike-sharing schemes have taken off in places like Buenos Aires
AMY:
Mmm. They built a huge network of cycle lanes to support the introduction of the scheme there, didn’t they? It attracted huge numbers of cyclists where previously there were hardly any.
JAKE:
An example of good planning (Q28)
.
AMY:
Absolutely. New York is a good example of how not to introduce a scheme. When they launched it,
it was more than ten times the price of most other schemes (Q29)
.
JAKE:
More than it costs to take a taxi. Crazy, I think the organisers lacked vision and ambition there.
AMY:
I think so too. Sydney would be a good example to use.
I would have expected it to have grown pretty quickly here.
JAKE:
Yes.
I can’t quite work out why it hasn’t been an instant success like some of the others (Q30)
. It’s a shame really.
AMY:
I know. OK so now we’ve thought about…

剑桥雅思18 Test2 Part3
雅思听力
原文
ADAM:
So, Michelle, shall we make a start on our presentation? We haven’t got that much time left.
MICHELLE:
No, Adam. But at least we’ve done all the background reading. I found it really interesting – I’d never even heard of the Laki eruption before this.
ADAM:
Me neither. I suppose 1783 is a long time ago.
MICHELLE:
But it was a huge eruption and it had such devastating consequences.
ADAM:
I know. It was great there were so many primary sources to look at. It really gives you a sense of how catastrophic the volcano was. People were really trying to make sense of the science for the first time.
MICHELLE:
That’s right. But
what I found more significant was how it impacted directly and
indirectly on political events, as well as having massive social and economic consequences (Q21)
.
ADAM:
I know. That should be the main focus of our presentation.
MICHELLE:
The observations made by people at the time were interesting, weren’t they? I mean, they all gave a pretty consistent account of what happened, even if they didn’t always use the same terminology.
ADAM:
Yeah.
I was surprised there were so many weather stations established by that time (Q22)
– so, you know, you can see how the weather changed, often by the hour.
MICHELLE:
Right. Writers at the time talked about the Laki haze to describe the volcanic fog that spread across Europe. They all realized that this wasn’t the sort of fog they were used to – and of course this was in pre-industrial times – so they hadn’t experienced sulphur-smelling fog before.
ADAM:
No, that’s true.
MICHELLE:
Reports from the period
blamed the haze for an increase in headaches, respiratory issues and asthma attacks (Q23)
. And they all describe how it covered the sun and made it look a strange red colour.
ADAM:
Must have been very weird.
MICHELLE:
It’s interesting that Benjamin Franklin wrote about the haze. Did you read that? He was the American ambassador in Paris at the time.
ADAM:
Yeah. At first no one realised that the haze was caused by the volcanic eruption in Iceland.
MICHELLE:
It was Benjamin Franklin who realised that before anyone else (Q24).
ADAM:
He’s often credited with that, apparently. But a French naturalist beat him to it (Q24)
– I can’t remember his name. I’d have to look it up. Then other naturalists had the same idea – all independently of each other.
MICHELLE:
Oh right. We should talk about the immediate impact of the eruption, which was obviously enormous – especially in Iceland,  where so many people died.
ADAM:
Mmm. You’d expect that –  and the fact that the volcanic ash drifted so swiftly –
but not that the effects would go on for so long (Q25)
. Or that two years after the eruption,
strange weather events were being reported as far away as North America and North Africa (Q26)
.
MICHELLE:
No. I found all that hard to believe too. It must have been terrible – and there was nothing anyone could do about it, even if they knew the ash cloud was coming in their direction.
MICHELLE:
We should run through some of the terrible consequences of the eruption experienced in different countries. There’s quite a varied range.
ADAM:
Starting with Iceland, where the impact on farming was devastating.
MICHELLE:
Mmm. One of the most dramatic things there was the effect on
livestock as they grazed in the fields. They were poisoned (Q27)
because they ate vegetation that had been contaminated with fluorine as a result of the volcanic fallout.
ADAM:
That was horrible. In Egypt, the bizarre weather patterns led to a severe drought and as a result the Nile didn’t flood, which meant the crops all failed.
MICHELLE:
It’s so far from where the eruption happened and yet
the famine there led to more people dying than any other country (Q28)
. It was worse than the plague.
ADAM:
Then in the UK the
mortality rate
went up a lot- presumably from respiratory illnesses. According to one report
it was about double the usual number and included an unusually high percentage of people under the age of 25 (Q29
).
MICHELLE:
Mmm. I think people will be surprised to hear that the weather in the USA was badly affected too. George Washington even makes a note in his diary that they were snowbound until March in Virginia. That was before he became president.
ADAM:
Yes, and
there was ice floating down the Mississippi, which was unprecedented (Q30)
.
MICHELLE:
Astonishing, really. Anyway, what do you think …

原文
TUTOR: Right, Jason and Karin, now I asked you to look at the case study for Box Telecom as part of your exam assessment. It’s interesting because they are in the middle of problems at the moment and I want you to track how they deal with them. Let’s start with you, Karin. Having read through the case study, can you just summarise what the problems were that Box Telecom had to take on board?
KARIN: Um, yeah… Well of course what first came to their attention was that, despite a new advertising campaign, they were suffering from falling
sales
– and this is something that had many causes. On top of that immediate problem, what had also happened over the last two years was that, although they had invested in an expansion plan, they had to face up to increased
competition
. And, before they had a chance to get to grips with the effects of that, they were stalled by a strike and it was just when they were thinking about making a colossal investment in new machinery for their plants. So they were really in trouble.
Q21, Q22
TUTOR: Yes, I think that’s fair. And Jason, you contacted the company, didn’t you?What did the company define as the reasons for these problems?
JASON: Well, I think they’ve hit on the right things – it would be easy to say they had invested too heavily, or at the wrong time, but in fact the signs were good and what they were set back by was high
interest rates
. At the same time, their longer-term problems, which were affecting their market share, were eventually credited to poor
training
– and having looked at the details in their last report I think that’s right.
Q23, Q24
TUTOR: So, onto the larger issues then. Karin, what do you think the company will do?
KARIN: Hmm… Well, obviously they have the choice of accepting the very favourable terms that another company – KMG Plc- have given them to buy them out. That would mean creating a new company with a new image. Or they could decide on a bolder move and offer some new shares if they wanted. But I think they’re much more cautious than that and expect they will start
trying to find individuals who’d be prepared to back them with some of the capital they need
.
Q25
TUTOR: Well, you mustn’t always assume that dramatic problems require dramatic solutions. Sometimes there’s a simple fix such as changing the guy at the top. If they truly are cautious, then I suspect they will seek to shut down some of their shops. But a more ambitious approach, and one which I think would have more chance of success, would be to
alter how they’re running things
– the management layers and the processes. So in your analysis try to think of all the options. Jason?
Q26
JASON: Yes, it’s interesting because I’ve found it a really useful company to study. Its problems cross all types of industries and it’s lucky it’s so big – a smaller or even medium-sized company would have gone under by now.
TUTOR: Ah well in fact, what I want you two to do is to go away when we’ve finished our discussion today and write a report. We’ve looked in general at the telecommunications market in the UK over the last few sessions and I want you to take Box Telecom as an example and
suggest some ways in which they might overcome their problems
. And outline the reasons why you think as you do – but try and keep it intrinsic to the company rather than dragging in other examples. Is that OK, Karin?
Q27
KARIN: Yes, I think I can do that. Personally I’ve got great hopes for it.
I think it will recover
. That advertising campaign they did was very strong and they’re very innovative with their products – they set new trends. The company’s got to recover, don’t you think, Jason?
Q28
JASON: Hmmm – I’m not sure. I think it can but it’s not a foregone conclusion unless they manage
to attract the right level of investment
. The company definitely needs a boost
and to attract more highly skilled workers if their recovery is to be long-lasting. When I was talking to the marketing manager he said to me that he thinks the company had got a great management team – but he would say that, wouldn’t he? – but they are suffering from having to work with outdated production machinery and that could cost a lot to put right.
Q29
TUTOR: Well, personally I think the stock market is to blame. I think they were expecting too much of the company and then inevitably it looked bad when it didn’t perform. The market should have had more realistic expectations.
And I disagree with you about the advertising campaign Karin. That’s where they could do with some innovation
– to get sales kick-started. Anyway, let’s see what you come up with… [fade]

剑桥雅思17 Test2 Part4
雅思听力
原文
Right, everyone, let’s make a start. Over the past few sessions, we’ve been considering the reasons why some world languages are in decline, and today I’m going to introduce another factor that affects languages, and the speakers of those languages, and that’s technology and, in particular, digital technology. In order to illustrate its effect, I’m going to focus on the Icelandic language, which is spoken by around
321,000 (Q31)
people, most of whom live in Iceland – an island in the North Atlantic Ocean.
The problem for this language is not the number of speakers – even though this number is small. Nor is it about losing words to other languages, such as English. In fact, the
vocabulary (Q32)
of Icelandic is continually increasing because when speakers need a new word for something, they tend to create one, rather than borrowing from another language. All this makes Icelandic quite a special language – it’s changed very little in the past millennium, yet it can handle twenty-first-century concepts related to the use of computers and digital technology. Take, for example, the word for web browser … this is
vafri
in Icelandic, which comes from the verb ‘to wander’. I can’t think of a more appropriate term because that’s exactly what you do mentally when you browse the internet. Then there’s an Icelandic word for
podcast (Q33)
– which is too hard to pronounce! And so on.
Icelandic, then, is alive and growing, but – and it’s a big but – young Icelanders spend a great deal of time in the digital world and this world is predominantly English. Think about
smartphones (Q34)
. They didn’t even exist until comparatively recently, but today young people use them all the time to read books, watch TV or films, play games, listen to music, and so on. Obviously, this is a good thing in many respects because it promotes their
bilingual (Q35)
skills, but the extent of the influence of English in the virtual world is staggering and it’s all happening really fast.
For their parents and grandparents, the change is less concerning because they already have their native-speaker skills in Icelandic. But for young speakers – well, the outcome is a little troubling. For example, teachers have found that
playground (Q36)
conversations in Icelandic secondary schools can be conducted entirely in English, while teachers of much younger children have reported situations where their classes find it easier to say what is in a
picture (Q37)
using English, rather than Icelandic. The very real and worrying consequence of all this is that the
young
generation in Iceland is at risk of losing its mother tongue.
Of course, this is happening to other European languages too, but while internet companies might be willing to offer, say, French options in their systems, it’s much harder for them to justify the expense of doing the same for a language  that has a population the size of a French town, such as Nice. The other drawback of Icelandic is the
grammar (Q38)
, which is significantly more complex than in most languages. At the moment, the tech giants are simply not interested in tackling this.
So, what is the Icelandic government doing about this? Well, large sums of money are being allocated to a language technology fund that it is hoped will lead to the development of Icelandic sourced apps and other social media and digital systems, but clearly this is going to be an uphill struggle.
On the positive side, they know that Icelandic is still the official language of education and government. It has survived for well over a thousand years and the experts predict that its future in this nation state is sound and will continue to be so. However, there’s no doubt that it’s becoming an inevitable second choice in young people’s lives.
This raises important questions. When you consider how much of the past is tied up in a language, will young Icelanders lose their sense of their own
identity (Q39)
? Another issue that concerns the government of Iceland is this. If children are learning two languages through different routes, neither of which they are fully
fluent (Q40)
in, will they be able to express themselves properly?

剑桥雅思7Test1听力Section4答案解析 Seminar on Rock Art
剑7 test 1 Section 4
雅思听力
原文
Good afternoon, everyone!
This is the first seminar in preparation for our archaeological fieldwork in Namibia; we are fantastically lucky to have received partial research funding for this trip from our Institute, so I shall expect 200% attention and participation from you all. First in this seminar, I’m going to give a brief introduction to contemporary research on rock art, and in the second part I’m going to give you some do’s and don’ts for our fieldwork trip
in April
– so please listen very carefully.
Q31
I’m first going to focus on the interpretation of rock art in Namibia. We are very fortunate to be going to an area where you can find some of the most important sites in the entire world. And I hope to show you how easy it is for everyone to make mistakes in looking at cultures which are different from our own – the first and most important lesson we have to learn.
In Namibia there are both paintings and engravings – that’s where the surface of the rock is cut out. Many of the engravings show footprints of animals and most scholars used to think that the purpose of these was simple and obvious: this rock art was like a school book with pictures
to teach children about tracks
: which track belonged to which animal – giraffe, lion and so on.
Q32
But there were some mysteries. First, when you look at a typical Namibian painting or engraving,
you see the tracks are repeated
, there are dozens of tracks for the same animal. You’d expect just one clear illustration if the reason – the aim  was to teach tracking. Now there were two more problems. Why are some of the engravings of animals very accurate as you’d expect – all clearly identifiable  and others quite unrealistic?
Q33
And another mystery – some of these unrealistic animals – that’s in the engravings seem to be
half human
. Some, for example, have got human faces. Many researchers now think that these were pictures the wise men engraved of themselves.
They believed they could use magic to control the animals
they had drawn, so the hunters could then catch them for food.
Q34 Q35
This shows you some of the dangers of coming from one culture to another, as we’ll be doing, without understanding it fully. Scholars imagined that children looked at rock art pictures to learn to track -just because they themselves had learnt skills from pictures; many researchers now believe that rock art had a much more complex purpose. And we’ll talk more about it next week!
Now before I invite you to join in a discussion in this second part of the seminar, I’d like to make some very important points about our fieldwork – and in fact any field trip to look at rock art.
We’re going to a number of sites, and we won’t always be together. The single largest problem faced by people who manage the sites is – yes, I’m sure you’ve guessed – damage caused by visitors, even though it’s usually unintentional.
Whenever you do go to a site, don’t forget you can learn many things from
observing at a distance
instead of walking all over it. This can really help to reduce visitor pressure. People often say, ‘Well, there’s only two of us and just this one time’, but maybe thousands of people are saying the same thing.
Q36
And then some basic rules to guide you – we’ll have our own camp near a village, but remember never to camp on a site if you go on your own. It may be disrespectful to the
people of that culture
, and certainly don’t make
fires
, however romantic it may seem. It’s really dangerous in dry areas, and you can easily burn priceless undiscovered material by doing so.
Q37 Q38
So, how are we going to enjoy the rock art on our field trip? By looking at it, drawing it and photographing it –
NEVER by touching
it or even tracing it. Rock art is fragile and precious.
Q39
Remember that climbing on rocks and in caves can destroy in a moment what has lasted for centuries. So no heroics in Namibia, please! Try to be extra careful and help others to be too.
And lastly please don’t even move rocks or branches to take photographs –
you should leave the site intact
– I’m sure I can rely on you to do that.
Q40
Well, that’s about all I want to say before today’s first discussion, but if you have any questions please ask them now – and don’t forget you’ll find some fascinating information about world-wide sites on the Internet. Right, first question then?

原文
Scientists believe that a majority of the earth’s bird population migrate in some fashion or other. Some travel seasonally for relatively short distances, such as birds that move from their winter habitats in lowlands to mountain tops for the summers. Others, like the Arctic Tern, travel more than 25,000 miles seasonally between the northern and southern poles. Bird migration has been studied over many centuries through a variety of observations.
But until relatively recently, where birds went to in the winter was considered something of a mystery. The lack of modern science and technology led to many theories that we now recognize as error-filled and even somewhat amusing. Take hibernation theory for example – two thousand years ago, it was commonly believed that when birds left an area, they went underwater to hibernate in the seas and oceans. Another theory for the regular appearance and disappearance of birds was that they spent winter hidden in
mud (Q31)
till the weather changed and food became abundant again. The theory that some birds hibernate persisted until experiments were done on caged birds in the 1940s which demonstrated that birds have no hibernation instinct.
One of the earliest naturalists and philosophers from ancient Greece was Aristotle who was the first writer to discuss the disappearance and reappearance of some bird species at certain times of year. He developed the theory of transmutation, the seasonal change of one species into another, by observing redstarts and robins. He observed that in the autumn, small birds called ‘redstarts’ began to lose their
feathers (Q32)
, which convinced Aristotle that they changed into robins for the winter, and back into redstarts in the summer. These assumptions are understandable given that this pair of species are similar in
shape (Q33)
, but are a classic example of an incorrect interpretation based on correct observations.
The most bizarre theory was put forward by an English amateur scientist, Charles Morton, in the seventeenth century. He wrote a surprisingly well-regarded paper  claiming that birds migrate to the
moon (Q34)
and back every year. He came to this conclusion as the only logical explanation for the total disappearance of some species.
One of the key moments in the development of migration theory came in 1822 when a white stork was shot in Germany. This particular stork made history because of the long spear in its
neck (Q35)
which incredibly had not killed it – everyone immediately realised this spear was definitely not European. It turned out to be a spear from a tribe in Central Africa. This was a truly defining moment in the history of ornithology because it was the first
evidence (Q36)
that storks spend their winters in sub-aharan Africa. You can still see the ‘arrow stork’ in the Zoological Collection of the University of Rostock in Germany.
People gradually became aware that European birds moved south in autumn and north in summer but didn’t know much about it until the practice of catching birds and putting rings on their legs became established. Before this, very little information was available about the actual
destinations (Q37)
of particular species and how they travelled there. People speculated that larger birds provided a kind of taxi service for smaller birds by carrying them on their backs. This idea came about because it seemed impossible that small birds weighing only a few grams could fly over vast
oceans (Q38)
. This idea was supported by observations of bird behaviour such as the harassment of larger birds by smaller birds.
The development of bird ringing, by a Danish schoolteacher, Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen, made many discoveries possible. This is still common practice today and relies upon what is known as
‘recovery’ (Q39)
– this is when ringed birds are found dead in the place they have migrated to, and identified. Huge amounts of data were gathered in the early part of the twentieth century and for the first time in history people understood where birds actually went to in winter. In 1931, an
atlas (Q40)
was published showing where the most common species of European birds migrated to. More recent theories about bird migration …

RESENTER:
This evening we’re delighted to welcome Dan Beagle, who’s just written a book on looking for and finding food in the wild. He’s going to tell us everything we need to know about picking wild mushrooms. Thank you very much. Well, I need to start by talking about safety. You really
DAN:
Thank you very much. Well, I need to start by talking about safety. You really need to know what you’re doing because some mushrooms are extremely poisonous. Having said that, once you know what to look for, it’s really worth doing for the amazing variety of mushrooms available – which you can’t get in the shops. But of course, you have to be very careful and that’s why l always say
you should never consume mushrooms picked by friends or neighbours (Q11)
– always remember that some poisonous mushrooms look very similar to edible ones and it’s easy for people to get confused.
The other thing to avoid is mushrooms
growing beside busy roads (Q12)
for obvious reasons. But nothing beats the taste of freshly picked mushrooms – don’t forget that the ones in the shops are often several days old and past their best.
There are certain ideas about wild mushrooms that it’s important to be aware. Don’t listen to people who tell you that it’s only OK to eat mushrooms that are pale or dull- this is completely untrue.
Some edible mushrooms are bright red (Q13)
, for example. Personally, I prefer mushrooms cooked but it won’t do you any harm to eat them uncooked in salads – it’s not necessary to peel them. Another thing you should remember is that you can’t tell if a mushroom is safe to eat by its smell – some of the most deadly mushrooms have no smell and taste quite nice, apparently.
Finally, just because deer or squirrels eat a particular mushroom
doesn’t mean that you can (Q14)
.
Of course, mushroom picking is associated with the countryside but if you haven’t got a car, your local park can be a great place to start. There are usually a range of habitats where mushrooms grow, such as playing fields and wooded areas.
But you need to be there first thing in the morning (Q15)
, as there’s likely be a lot of competition – not just from people but wildlife too. The deer often get the best mushrooms in my local park.
If you’re a complete beginner, I wouldn’t recommend going alone or relying on photos in a book, even the one I’ve written! There are some really good phone apps for identifying mushrooms, but you can’t always rely on getting a good signal in the middle of a wood.
If possible, you should go with a group led by an expert (Q16)
– you’ll stay safe and learn a lot that way.
Conservation is a really important consideration and you must follow a few basic rules.
You should never pick all the mushrooms in one area – collect only enough for your own needs (Q17)
. Be very careful that you don’t trample on young mushrooms or other plants. And make sure you don’t pick any mushrooms that are endangered and protected by law.
There’s been a decline in some varieties of wild mushrooms in this part of the country. Restaurants are becoming more interested in locally sourced food like wild mushrooms,
but the biggest problem is that so many new houses have been built in this area in the last ten years (Q18)
. And more water is being taken from rivers and reservoirs because of this, and mushroom habitats have been destroyed.
Anyway, a word of advice on storing mushrooms.
Collect them in a brown paper bag and as soon as you get home, put them in the fridge. They’ll be fine for a couple of days
, but it’s best to cook them as soon as possible – after washing them really carefully first, of course.
So everybody knows what a mushroom tastes like, right? Well, you’ll be surprised by the huge variety of wild mushrooms there are. Be adventurous!
They’re great
in so many dishes – stir fries, risottos, pasta (Q19)
. But just be aware that some people can react badly to certain varieties so it’s a good idea not to eat huge quantities to begin with.
OK, so now I’m going to show you …

剑桥雅思11Test4Section4听力答案解析 The use of soil to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
剑桥雅思11
test4Section4
雅思听力
原文
As we saw in the last lecture, a major cause of climate change is the rapid rise in the level of
carbon
dioxide
in the atmosphere over the last century.
If we could reduce the amount of CO2, perhaps the rate of climate change could also be slowed down.
One
potential
method involves enhancing the role of the soil that plants grow in, with regard to absorbing CO2.
Rattan Lal, a soil scientist from Ohio State University, in the USA, claims that the world’s agricultural soils could potentially absorb 13 per cent of the
carbon
dioxide
in the atmosphere – the
equivalent
of the amount released in the last 30 years.
And research is going on into how this might be achieved.
Lal first came to the idea that soil might be valuable in this way not through an interest in climate change, but rather out of concern for the land itself and the people dependent on it.
Carbon-rich soil is dark,
crumbly
and
fertile
, and retains some water.
But
erosion
can occur if soil is
dry (Q31)
, which is a likely effect if it contains inadequate amounts of
carbon
.
Erosion
is of course bad for people trying to grow crops or breed animals on that
terrain
.
In the 1970s and’80s, Lal was studying soils in Africa so devoid of organic matter that the ground had become extremely
hard (Q32)
, like
cement
.
There he met a
pioneer
in the study of global warming, who suggested that
carbon
from the soil had moved into the atmosphere.
This is now looking increasingly likely.
Let me explain.
For millions of years,
carbon
dioxide
levels in the atmosphere have been regulated, in part, by a natural partnership between plants and microbes – tiny organisms in the soil.
Plants absorb CO2 from the air and transform it into
sugars (Q33)
and other carbon-based substances.
While a
proportion
of these
carbon
products remain in the plant, some transfer from the
roots (Q34)
to
fungi
and soil microbes, which store the
carbon
in the soil.
The invention of
agriculture
some 10,000 years ago disrupted these ancient soil-building processes and led to the loss of
carbon
from the soil.
When humans started draining the natural
topsoil
, and ploughing it up for planting, they
exposed
the buried
carbon
to oxygen.
This created
carbon
dioxide
and released it into the air.
And in some places, grazing by
domesticated
animals has removed all
vegetation
, releasing
carbon
into the air.
Tons of
carbon
have been stripped from the world’s soils – where it’s needed – and pumped into the atmosphere.
So what can be done?
Researchers are now coming up with evidence that even modest changes to farming can significantly help to reduce the amount of
carbon
in the atmosphere.
Some growers have already started using an approach known as regenerative
agriculture
.
This aims to boost the
fertility
of soil and keep it
moist
(Q35)
through established practices.
These include keeping fields planted all year round, and increasing the
variety (Q36)
of plants being grown.
Strategies like these can significantly increase the amount of
carbon
stored in the soil, so agricultural researchers are now building a case for their use in combating climate change.
One American investigation into the
potential
for storing CO2 on agricultural lands is taking place in California.
Soil scientist Whendee Silver of the University of California, Berkeley, is conducting a first-of-its-kind study on a large
cattle (Q37)
farm in the state.
She and her students are testing the effects on
carbon
storage of the
compost
that is created from waste – both agricultural, including
manure
and cornstalks, and waste produced in
gardens (Q38)
, such as leaves, branches, and lawn trimmings.
In Australia, soil ecologist Christine Jones is testing another promising soil-enrichment strategy.
Jones and 12 farmers are working to build up soil
carbon
by cultivating
grasses (Q39)
that stay green all year round.
Like composting, the approach has already been proved experimentally;
Jones now hopes to show that it can be applied on working farms and that the resulting
carbon
capture can be accurately measured.
It’s hoped in the future that projects such as these will demonstrate the role that farmers and other land managers can play in reducing the harmful effects of greenhouse gases.
For example, in countries like the United States, where most farming operations use large applications of
fertiliser
, changing such long-standing habits will require a change of system.
Rattan Lal argues that farmers should receive
payment (Q40)
not just for the corn or beef they produce, but also for the
carbon
they can store in their soil.
Another study being carried out …

HUGO:
Hi Chantal. What did you think of the talk, then?
CHANTAL:
Hi Hugo. I thought it was good once I’d moved seats.
HUGO:
Oh – were the people beside you chatting or something?
CHANTAL:
It wasn’t that. I went early so that I’d get a seat and not have to stand, but then this guy sat right in front of me and he was so tall!
HUGO:
It’s hard to see through people’s heads, isn’t it (Q21)?
CHANTAL:
Impossible
(Q21)
!
Anyway, to answer your question, I thought it was really interesting, especially what the speaker said about the job market.
HUGO:
Me too. I mean we know we’re going into a really competitive field so it’s obvious that we may struggle to get work.
CHANTAL:
That’s right – and we know we can’t all have that ‘dream job’.
HUGO:
Yeah, but it looks like
there’s a whole range of … areas of work that we hadn’t even thought of (Q22)
– like fashion journalism, for instance.
CHANTAL:
Yeah – I wasn’t expecting so many career options.
HUGO:
Mmm. Overall, she had quite a strong message, didn’t she?
CHANTAL:
She did. She kept saying things like ‘I know you all think this, but .’and then she’d tell us how it really is.
HUGO:
Perhaps she thinks students are a bit narrow-minded about the industry.
CHANTAL:
It was a bit harsh, though! We know it’s a tough industry (Q23).
HUGO:
Yeah – and we’re only first years, after all. We’ve got a lot to learn (Q23).
CHANTAL:
Exactly. Do you think our secondary-school education should have been more career-focused?
HUGO:
Well, we had numerous talks on careers, which was good, but
none of them were very inspiring. They could have asked more people like today’s speaker to talk to us (Q24).
CHANTAL:
I agree. We were told about lots of different careers – just when we needed to be, but not by the experts who really know stuff.
HUGO:
So did today’s talk influence your thoughts on what career you’d like to take up in the future?
CHANTAL:
Well. I promised myself that I’d go through this course and keep an open mind till the end.
HUGO:
But I think it’s better to pick an area of the industry now and then aim to get better and better at it.
CHANTAL:
Well, I think we’ll just have to differ on that issue (Q25)!
HUGO:
One thing’s for certain, though. From what she said, we’ll be unpaid assistants in the industry for quite a long time.
CHANTAL:
Mmm.
HUGO:
I’m prepared for that (Q26)
, aren’t you?
CHANTAL:
Actually, I’m not going to accept that view.
HUGO:
Really? But she knows it’s the case – and everyone else says the same.
CHANTAL:
That doesn’t mean it has to be true for me.
HUGO:
OK. Well – I hope you’re right!
CHANTAL:
I thought the speaker’s account of her first job was fascinating.
HUGO:
Yeah – she admitted she was lucky to get work being a personal dresser for a musician. She didn’t even apply for the job and there she was getting paid to choose all his clothes.
CHANTAL:
It must have felt amazing – though she said all she was looking for back then was experience, not financial reward.
HUGO:
Mmm. And then he was so mean, telling her
she was more interested in her own appearance than his (Q27)
!
CHANTAL:
But – she did realise he was right about that, which really made me think. I am always considering my own clothes but now I can see you should be focusing on your client!
HUGO:
She obviously regretted losing the job.
CHANTAL:
Well, as she said,
she should have hidden her negative feelings about him. but she didn’t (Q28)
.
HUGO:
It was really brave the way she picked herself up and took that job in retail. Fancy working in a shop after that!
CHANTAL:
Yeah – well, she recommended we all do it at some point. I guess as a designer you’d get to find out some useful information, like how big or small the average shopper is.
HUGO:
I think that’s an issue for manufacturers, not designers. However, it would be useful to know if there’s a gap in the market – you know,
an item that no one’s stocking but that consumers are looking for (Q29)
.
CHANTAL:
Yeah, people don’t give up searching.
They also take things back to the store if they aren’t right (Q30)
.
HUGO:
Yeah. Imagine you worked in an expensive shop and you found out the garments sold there were being returned because they … fell apart in the wash!
CHANTAL:
Yeah, it would be good to know that kind of thing.
HUGO:
Yeah.

man:
Good morning, Kenton Festival box office.
How can I help you?
woman:
Oh, good morning. I’m coming to Kenton for a few days’ holiday next month, and a friend told me there’s a festival.
She gave me this number to find out about it.
man:
That’s right, the festival begins on the 16th of May and goes on till the 19th.
woman:
Oh, that’s great.
I’ll be there from the 15th till the 19th.
So could you tell me the programme, please?
man:
Well, on the first day, there’s the opening ceremony, in the town centre.
People start gathering around 2 o’clock, to get a good place to see from, and the events will start at
2.45 (Q1)
, and finish about 5.30.
woman:
OK, thanks. I’ll make sure I get there early to get a good spot.
man:
The festival will be officially opened by the mayor.
He’ll just speak for a few minutes, welcoming everyone to the festival.
All the town councillors will be there, and of course lots of other people.
woman:
Right.
man:
Then there’ll be a performance by a
band (Q2)
.
Most years we have a children’s
choir
, but this year the local army cadets offered to perform, and they’re very good.
woman:
Uhuh.
man:
After that, a community group from the town will perform a
play (Q3)
they’ve written themselves, just a short one.
It’s about Helen Tungate.
I don’t know if you’ve heard of her?
woman:
I certainly have.
She was a
scientist (Q4)
years ago.
man:
That’s right. She was born in Kenton exactly 100 years ago, so we’re celebrating her centenary.
woman:
I’m a biologist, so I’ve always been interested in her.
I didn’t realise she came from Kenton.
man:
Yes. Well, all that will take place in the afternoon, and later, as the sun sets, there’ll be a firework display.
You should go to the park to watch, as you’ll get the best view from there, and the display takes place on the opposite side of the
river (Q5)
.
It’s always one of the most popular events in the festival.
woman:
Sounds great.
woman:
And what’s happening on the other days?
man:
There are several events that go on the whole time.
For example, the students of the art college have produced a number of videos, all connected with relationships between children and their
grandparents (Q6)
.
woman:
That sounds interesting.
It makes a change from children and parents, doesn’t it!
man:
Exactly. Because the art college is in use for classes, throughout the festival, the videos are being shown in Handsworth House.
woman:
How do you spell the name?
man:
H-A-N-D-S-W-O-R-T-H (Q7)
, Handsworth House.
It’s close to the Town Hall.
woman:
Right.
man:
Now let me see, what else can I tell you about?
woman:
Are there any displays of ballet dancing?
I’m particularly interested in that as I do it as a hobby.
man:
There isn’t any ballet, I’m afraid, but there’ll be a
demonstration
of
traditional (Q8)
dances from all round the country.
woman:
Oh, that’d be nice.
Where’s that being held?
man:
It’s in the market in the town centre – the
outdoor (Q9)
one, not the covered market.
And it’s on at 2 and 5 every afternoon of the festival, apart from the first day.
woman:
Lovely. I’m interested in all kinds of dancing, so I’m sure I’ll enjoy that!
man:
Mmm. I’m sure you will.
woman:
And I’d really like to go to some concerts, if there are any.
man:
Yes, there are several.
Three performed by professionals, and one by local children.
woman:
And where is it being held?
man:
It’s in the library, which is in Park Street, on the 18th, at 6.30 in the evening.
woman:
I presume I’ll need tickets for that.
man:
Yes, you can book online, or you can buy them when you arrive in Kenton, either at the festival box office, or from any shops displaying our
logo (Q10)
in the windows.
woman:
Well, I think that’ll keep me busy for the whole of my stay in Kenton.
Thank you so much for all your help.
man:
You’re welcome, I hope you enjoy your stay.
woman:
Thank you. Goodbye.

AGENT: Right, I’ll make a note of that. Now – let’s see what else is available. What do you think of administrative work? There is a position for an
Office Assistant
at the English Language Centre.
Q8
STUDENT: That sounds interesting.
AGENT: It’s for 3 days a week – Monday, Friday and Saturday mornings. Interested?
STUDENT: Mmm. I was hoping to have Saturdays free. But I need the work so … can you tell me what the job involves?
AGENT: Yes, sure. It says here that you’ll be required to deal with student enquiries and
answer the phone
.
Q9
STUDENT: I’m sure I can handle all that without a problem.
AGENT: Great. Well, would you like me to arrange an interview for you? Say, Friday morning, around ten?
STUDENT: Could we make it a bit later? Unfortunately, I’ve got something to do at ten. Would that be OK?
AGENT: Not a problem. How about
eleven thirty
? Hope it works out for you Anita.
Q10
STUDENT: Me too. And thanks for all your help.

剑桥雅思4 test 1 Section 2听力原文 Riverside Industrial village
剑桥雅思4 test 1 Section 2的这10道题目是雅思听力第二部分比较典型的旅游景点介绍场景，在真正考试中出现概率极高，而且往往搭配地图题进行考察。不过这道题因为年代久远，其缺点也很明显。一方面，现在的Section 2填空题出现概率较低，通常以选择和匹配为主。另一方面，虽然地图题仍然是雅思听力考察的重点，但形式上往往采用选择题的模式，而非填空。
该部分难度最大的是第12题。首先，它没有很明确的提示词；其次，它还使用了倒置的考察手法。先出现who lived in the area的同义替换，然后才是答案。第三，craftsman这个单词也稍显偏僻，好多同学都不认识。
以下是剑4 test 1 Section 2雅思听力题目对应的原文，以供大家参考：
Good afternoon everybody and welcome to Riverside Industrial Village. To start your visit I’m just going to give you a brief account of the history of the museum before letting you roam about on your own. I won’t keep you long. OK?
Now, from where we’re standing you’ve got a good view of the river over there. And it was because of this fast-flowing water that this site was a natural place for manufacturing works. The water and the availability of raw materials in the area, like minerals and iron ore, and also the abundance of local fuels, like
coal and firewood
, all made this site suitable for industry from a very early time.
Water was the main source of power for the early industries and some of the water wheels were first established in the twelfth century, would you believe? At that time,
local craftsmen
first built an iron forge just behind the village here, on the bend in the river.  By the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the region’s rivers supported more than
a hundred and sixty
watermills – and many of these continued to operate well into the nineteenth century. But then the steam engine was invented and then the railways came and the centers of industry were able to move away from the rivers and the countryside and into the towns. So, industrial villages like this one became very rare.
So that’s the history for you. If you’d like any more information, you can ask me some questions, or you can read further in our excellent guide book.
Now I’m going to give you a plan of the site and I’d just like to point out where everything is and then you can take a look at everything for yourself.
I’ve already pointed out the river which is on the left. And of course, running along the bottom is
Woodside
Road, got it? OK. Now we’re standing at the entrance, see it at the bottom, and immediately to our right is the
Ticket Office.
You won’t need that because you’ve got your group booking, but just past it are the toilets -always good to know where they are. In front of us is the car park, as you can see, and to the left, by the entry gate is the
Gift Shop.
That’s where you can get copies of the guide, like this one here.
Now, beyond the car park, all the buildings are arranged in a half circle with a yard in the middle. The big, stone building at the top is the
main Workshop
. That’s where the furnace is and where all the metal was smelted and the tools were cast, as you’ll be able to see. Now, in the top right-hand comer, that building with bigger windows is the
Showroom
, where samples of all the tools that were made through the ages are on display. In the top left corner is the Grinding Shop, where the tools were sharpened and finished. And on one side of that, you can see the Engine Room and on the other is the
Café
, which isn’t an antique, you’ll be pleased to know, though they do serve very nice old-fashioned teas.
The row of buildings you can see on the left are the
cottages
. These were built for the workers towards the end of the eighteenth century and they’re still furnished from that period so you can get a good idea of ordinary people’s living conditions. Across the yard from them, you can see the stables where the horses were kept for transporting the products. And the separate building in front of them is the Works Office and that still has some of the old accounts on display.
Right, if anyone wants a guided tour then I’m starting at the Engine Room. If you’d like to come along, this way please, ladies and gentlemen.

剑桥雅思4 test 1 Section 3听力原文
该部分可以算作是雅思听力Section 3比较常见的老师与学生讨论论文的场景，涉及的内容包括文献讨论，疑难解答等。但从题目的角度来看，这10道题都偏简单一些。选择题部分干扰项设置的不够巧妙；匹配题部分选项偏短，而且都是同近义词替换；最后的图形匹配最近已经很少出现。所以如果大家这道题的正确率很高，千万不要得意忘形。
以下是剑4 test 1 Section 3雅思听力题目对应的原文，以供大家参考：
MELANIE: Excuse me, Dr Johnson. May I speak to you for a minute?
DR JOHNSON: Sure. Come in.
MELANIE: I’m Melanie Griffin. I’m taking your course in Population Studies.
DR JOHNSON: Right. Well, Melanie, how can I help you?
MELANIE: I’m… having a bit of trouble with the second assignment, and it’s due in twelve days.
DR JOHNSON: What sort of trouble are you having? Is the assignment question a problem?
MELANIE: Well, that’s part of the problem.   I’m also having – been having – trouble getting hold of the books. I’ve been to the library several times, and all the books are out.
DR JOHNSON: Sounds like you should have started borrowing books a bit earlier.
MELANIE: Well, I had
a really big assignment due in for another course
, and I’ve been spending all my time on that, and I thought…
Q21
DR JOHNSON: … You might get an extension of time to finish your assignment for me?
MELANIE: If that’s possible, but I don’t know…
DR JOHNSON: Well, yes, it is possible, but extensions are normally given only for
medical or compassionate reasons
, otherwise it’s really a question of organizing your study, and we don’t like giving extensions to students who simply didn’t plan their work properly. What did you get for your first assignment?
Q22
MELANIE: I got eighty-seven percent.
DR JOHNSON: Mmm, yes, you did very well indeed, so obviously you can produce good work.
MELANIE: I don’t think I’ll need too much extra time, as long as I can get hold of some of the important references.
DR JOHNSON: Well, since you did so well in your first assignment, I’m prepared to give you an extra two weeks for this one, so that’ll mean you’ll need to submit it about a month from now.
MELANIE: Thank you.
DR JOHNSON: Now, what about the reading materials? Have you checked out the journal articles in the list?
MELANIE: Umm, no, not yet, there were about twenty of them, and I wasn’t sure which ones would be most useful or important.
DR JOHNSON: Well, they’re all useful, but I don’t expect anyone to read them all, because a number of them deal with the same issues. Let me give you some suggestions. The article by Anderson and Hawker is really worth reading.
MELANIE: Right, I’ll read that one.
DR JOHNSON: You should also read the article by Jackson, but just look at the part on the
research methodology
– how they did it.
Q23
MELANIE: OK… Jackson, got that…
DR JOHNSON: And if you have time, the one by Roberts says very relevant things, although it’s not essential.
MELANIE: So, OK, if it’s
useful
. I’ll try and read that one…
Q24
DR JOHNSON: NOw, the one by Morris. I wouldn’t bother with that at this stage, if I were you.
MELANIE: OK, I
won’t bother with Morris
. Oh, now, someone told me the article by Cooper is important.
Q25
DR JOHNSON: Well, yes, in a way, but just look at
the last part
, where he discusses the research results. And lastly, there’s Forster – I can’t think why I included that one. It’s not bad and
could be of some help, but not that much.
Q26 Q27
DR JOHNSON: Now, let’s deal with the assignment question. What’s the problem there?
MELANIE: It’s the graph on page two.
DR JOHNSON: What seems to be the problem? It’s just the bar graph showing the reasons why people change where they live.
MELANIE: Well, I’ve got a photocopy but the reasons at the bottom are missing.
DR JOHNSON: Ah, OK. Look at the first bar on the graph – now that indicates the number of people who move because they want more space.
MELANIE: Oh I see… bar one. OK… Now, what about the next bar?
DR JOHNSON: Bar two is to do with
the people living nearby disturbing them
, so they chose to move away to somewhere quieter. Now let’s look at bar number three… another reason people change their place of living is that they want to be closer to the city.
Q28
MELANIE: OK. Proximity to the city is an issue…
DR JOHNSON: Now… bar number four refers to problems when the owner of the property won’t help fix things that go wrong. In other words,
the
owner is not helpful and so the tenants move out
.
Q29
MELANIE: OK… Now, what about bar five?
DR JOHNSON: Bar five is about those people who move because they need a bus or train to get them into the city or to go to work.
MELANIE: OK… And bar six?
DR JOHNSON: Bar number six is interesting. That reason was given quite a lot – people moving because they wanted to be in
a more attractive neighborhood
.
Q30
MELANIE: Oh, yes, thank you very much.

剑桥雅思11
test1 Section1
雅思听力
原文
OFFICIAL
: Hello?
WOMAN
: Oh, hello.
I wanted to enquire about hiring a room in the Village Hall, for the evening of September the first.
OFFICIAL
: Let me just see …
Yes, we have both rooms available that evening.
There’s our Main Hall – that’s got seating for  200 people.
Or there’s the Charlton Room …
WOMAN
: Sorry?
OFFICIAL
: The
Charlton Room – C-H-A-R L-T-O-N (Q1)
.
That’s got seating for up to one hundred.
WOMAN
: Well, we’re organising a dinner to raise money for a charity, and we’re hoping for at least 150 people, so I think we’ll go for the Main Hall.
How much would that cost?
OFFICIAL
: Let’s see.
You wanted it for the evening of September 1st?
WOMAN
: Yes, that’s a Saturday.
OFFICIAL
: So from six pm to midnight that’d be
￡115 (Q2)
– that’s the weekend price, it’s ￡75 on weekdays.
WOMAN
: That’s all right.
OFFICIAL
: And I have to tell you there’s also a
deposit
of ￡250, which is returnable of course as long as there’s no damage.
But we do insist that this is paid in
cash (Q3)
, we don’t take cards for that.
You can pay the actual rent of the room however you like though – cash, credit card,
cheque
…
WOMAN
: Oh, well I suppose that’s OK.
So does the charge include use of tables and chairs and so on?
OFFICIAL
: Oh, yes.
WOMAN
: And what about
Parking (Q4)
?
OFFICIAL
: Yeah.
that’s all included.
The only thing that isn’t included is …
you said you were organising a dinner?
WOMAN
: Yeah.
OFFICIAL
: Well, you’ll have to pay extra for the kitchen if you want to use that.It’s ￡25.
It’s got very good facilities – good quality cookers and fridges and so on.
WOMAN
: OK, well I suppose that’s all right.
We can cover the cost in our entry charges.
OFFICIAL
: Right.
SO I’ll make a note of that.
Now there are just one or two things you need to think about before the event.
For example, you’ll have to see about getting a licence if you’re planning to have any
music (Q5)
during the meal.
WOMAN
: Oh, really?
OFFICIAL
: It’s quite
straightforward
, I’ll give you the details later on.
And about a week or ten days before your event you’ll need to contact the caretaker, that’s Mr Evans, to make the arrangements for
entry (Q6)
– he’ll sort that out with you.
WOMAN
: And do I give him the payment as well?
OFFICIAL
: NO, you do that directly with me.
WOMAN
: Right.
Now is there anything I need to know about what happens during the event?
OFFICIAL
: Well, as you’ll be aware, of course the building is no smoking throughout.
WOMAN
: Of course.
OFFICIAL
: NOW, are you having a band?
WOMAN
: Yes.
OFFICIAL
: Well, they’ll have a lot of equipment, so rather than using the front door they should park their van round the back and use the
stage (Q7)
door there.
You can open that from inside but don’t forget to lock it at the end.
WOMAN
: OK.
OFFICIAL
: And talking of bands, I’m sure I don’t need to tell you this, but you must make sure that no one fiddles about with the black box by the fire door – that’s a system that cuts in when the volume reaches a certain level.
It’s a legal requirement.
WOMAN
: Sure.
Anyway, we want people to be able to talk to one another so we don’t want anything too loud.
Oh, that reminds me, we’ll be having speeches – are there any microphones available?
OFFICIAL
: Yeah.
Just let the caretaker know, he’ll get those for you.
Right, now when the event is over we do ask that the premises are left in good condition.
So there’s a locked cupboard and you’ll be informed of the
code (Q8)
you need to open that.
It’s got all the cleaning equipment, brushes and
detergent
and so on.
WOMAN
: Right.
So what do we need to do after everyone’s gone?
Sweep the
floors
(Q9)
I suppose?
OFFICIAL
: Well, actually they have to be washed, not just swept.
Then you’ll be provided with black
plastic
bags, so all the rubbish must be collected up and left outside the door.
WOMAN
: Of course.
We’ll make sure everything’s left tidy.
Oh, and I forgot to ask, I presume we can have
decorations (Q10)
in the room?
OFFICIAL
: Yes, but you must take them down afterwards.
WOMAN
: Sure.
OFFICIAL
: And the chairs and tables should be stacked up neatly at the back of the room.
WOMAN
: I’ll make sure I’ve got a few people to help me.

雅思听力
原文
HELEN: I’ve brought my notes on our Biology Field Trip to Rocky Bay, Colin, so we can work on our report on the research we did together.
COLIN: OK. I’ve got mine too. Let’s look at the aims of the trip first.
HELEN: Right. What did you have?
COLIN: I just put something about getting experience of the different sorts of procedures used on a field trip.
But we need something about what causes different organisms to choose particular habitats (Q21)
.
HELEN: agree. And something about finding out how to protect organisms in danger of dying out?
COLIN: In our aims? But we weren’t really looking at that.
HELEN: I suppose not. OK, now there’s the list of equipment we all had to bring on the field trip. What did they tell us to bring a ruler for?
COLIN: It was something about measuring the slope of the shore, but of course we didn’t need it because we were measuring wind direction, and we’d brought the compass for that …
HELEN:
But not the piece of string to hold up in the air! Didn’t Mr. Blake make a fuss about us leaving that behind (Q22)
.
COLIN: Yeah. He does go on. Anyway it was easy to get one from another of the students.
HELEN: Now, the next section’s the procedure. I sent you the draft of that.
COLIN: Yeah. It was clear, but
I don’t think we need all these details of what time we left and what time we got back and how we divided up the different research tasks (Q23)
.
HELEN: OK. I’ll look at that again.
COLIN: Then we have to describe our method of investigation in detail.
So let’s begin with how we measured wave speed. I was surprised how straightforward that was (Q24)
.
HELEN: I’d expected us to have some sort of high-tech device, not just stand there and count the number of waves per minute. Not very precise, but I suppose it was good enough. But the way we measured the amount of salt was interesting.
COLIN: In the water from the rock pools?
HELEN: Yeah, oh, I wanted to check the chemicals we used in the lab when we analysed those samples – was it potassium chromate and silver nitrate?
COLIN: That’s right.
HELEN: OK. And we need the map of the seashore. You just left that to me. And I had to do it while the tide was low, well that was OK,
but the place I started it from was down on the beach, then I realised I should have gone up higher to get better visibility (Q25)
, so I had to start all over again. But at least I’d got the squared paper or I’d have had problems drawing it all to scale.
COLIN: Yes. It looks good. We could get a map of the region off the internet and see if we need to make any changes.
HELEN: I had a look but I couldn’t find anything. But you took some pictures, didn’t you?
COLIN: Yeah. I’ll email you them if you want.
HELEN: OK.
I’ll make my amendments using those, then I can scan it into our report (Q26)
. Great.
HELEN: Now when we get to our findings I thought we could divide them up into the different zones we identified on the shore and the problems organisms face in each zone. So for the highest area …
COLIN: … the splash zone?
HELEN: Yeah, we found mostly those tiny shellfish that have strong hard shells that act as protection.
COLIN: But not from other organisms that might eat them, predators?
HELEN: NO, that’s not the main danger for them.
But the shells prevent them from drying out because they’re in the open air for most of the time (Q27)
.
COLIN: Right. And since they’re exposed, they need to be able to find some sort of shelter, or cover themselves up,
so they don’t get too hot (Q28)
. Then in the middle and lower zones, nearer the sea, we need to discuss the effects of wave action …
HELEN: Yes, and how organisms develop structures to prevent themselves from being swept away, or even destroyed by being smashed against the rocks.
COLIN: I haven’t done anything on the geological changes. I don’t know what to put for that.
HELEN: NO, we weren’t concentrating on that. Maybe we need to find some websites.
COLIN: Good idea. I’ve got the lecture notes from Mr. Blake’s geology course, but they’re too general. But we could ask him which books on our Reading List might be most helpful.
HELEN: Right. OK, now I did a draft of the section of sources of possible error in our research, but I don’t know if you agree. For example, the size of the sample, and whether it’s big enough to make any general conclusions from. But I thought actually we did have quite a big sample.
COLIN: We did. And our general method of observation seemed quite reliable. But we might not be all that accurate as far as the actual numbers go.
HELEN: Yeah,
we might have missed some organisms – if they were hiding under a rock, for example (Q29)
. I wasn’t sure about the way we described their habitats. I decided it was probably OK.
COLIN: Yeah, and the descriptions we gave of the smaller organisms, they weren’t very detailed, but they were adequate in this context.
I’m not sure we identified all the species correctly though (Q30)
.
HELEN: OK, we’d better mention that. Now, how …

原文
TUTOR:
OK, so what I’d like you to do now is to talk to your partner about your presentations on urban planning. You should have done most of the reading now, so I’d like you to share your ideas, and talk about the structure of your presentation and what you need to do next.
CARLA:
OK Rob. I’m glad we chose quite a specific topic – cities built next to the sea. It made it much easier to find relevant information.
ROB:
Yeah. And cities are growing so quickly – I mean, we know that more than half the world’s population lives in cities now.
CARLA:
Yeah, though that’s all cities, not just ones on the coast. But
most of the biggest cities are actually built by the sea (Q21)
, I’d not realised that before.
ROB:
Nor me. And what’s more, a lot of them are built at places where rivers come out into the sea. But apparently this can be a problem.
CARLA:
Why?
ROB:
Well, as the city expands, agriculture and industry tend to spread further inland along the rivers, and so agriculture moves even further inland up the river. That’s not necessarily a problem, except it means
more and more pollutants are discharged into the rivers (Q22)
.
CARLA:
So these are brought downstream to the cities?
ROB:
Right. Hmm. Did you read that article about Miami, on the east coast of the USA?
CARLA:
NO.
ROB:
Well, apparently back in the 1950s they built channels to drain away the water in case of flooding.
CARLA:
Sounds sensible.
ROB:
Yeah, they spent quite a lot of money on them.
But what they didn’t take into account was global warming (Q23)
. So they built the drainage channels too close to sea level, and now sea levels are rising, they’re more or less useless. If there’s a lot of rain, the water can’t run away, there’s nowhere for it to go. The whole design was faulty.
CARLA:
So what are the authorities doing about it now?
ROB:
I don’t know. I did read that they’re aiming to stop disposing of waste water into the ocean over the next ten years.
CARLA:
But that won’t help with flood prevention now, will it?
ROB:
No.
Really they just need to find the money for something to replace the drainage channels (Q24
), in order to protect against flooding now. But in the long term they need to consider the whole ecosystem.
CARLA:
Right. Really, though, coastal cities can’t deal with their problems on their own, can they? I mean, they’ve got to start acting together at an international level instead of just doing their own thing.
ROB:
Absolutely. The thing is, everyone knows what the problems are and environmentalists have a pretty good idea of what we should be doing about them,
so they should be able to work together (Q25)
to some extent. But it’s going to be a long time before countries come to a decision on what principles they’re prepared to abide by.
CARLA:
Yes, if they ever do.
CARLA:
So I think we’ve probably got enough for our presentation. It’s only fifteen minutes.
ROB:
OK. So I suppose we’ll begin with some general historical background about why coastal cities were established. But
we don’t want to spend too long on that (Q26)
, the other students will already know a bit about it. It’s all to do with communications and so on.
CARLA:
Yes. We should mention some geographical factors, things like wetlands and river estuaries and coastal erosion and so on. We could have some maps of different cities with these features marked.
ROB:
On a handout you mean? Or
some slides everyone can see (Q27)
?
CARLA:
Yeah, that’d be better.
ROB:
It’d be good to go into past mistakes in a bit more detail. Did you read that case study of the problems there were in New Orleans with flooding a few years ago?
CARLA:
Yes.
We could use that as the basis for that part of the talk (Q28)
. I don’t think the other students will have read it, but they’ll remember hearing about the flooding at the time.
ROB:
OK. So that’s probably enough background.
CARLA:
So then we’ll go on to talk about what action’s being taken to deal with the problems of coastal cities.
ROB:
OK. What else do we need to talk about? Maybe something on future risks, looking more at the long term, if populations continue to grow.
CARLA:
Yeah. We’ll need to do a bit of work there, I haven’t got much information, have you?
ROB:
No.
We’ll need to look at some websites (Q29)
. Shouldn’t take too long.
CARLA:
OK. And I think we should end by talking about international implications. Maybe
we could ask people in the audience (Q30)
. We’ve got people from quite a lot of different places.
ROB:
That’d be interesting, if we have time, yes. So now shall we …

I’m coming to Burnham with my husband and two children for a few days on June the 27th, or possibly the 28th, and I’d like some ideas for things to do on the 29th.
MARTIN:
Yes, of course.
OK.
Then let’s start with a couple of events especially for children.
The art gallery is holding an event called ‘Family Welcome’ that day, when there are activities and trails to use throughout the gallery.
SUE:
That sounds interesting.
What time does it start?
MARTIN:
The gallery opens at 10, and
the ‘Family Welcome’ event runs from 10: 30 until 2 o’clock (Q1)
.
The gallery stays open until 5.
And several times during the day, they’re going to show a short film that the gallery has produced.
It demonstrates how ceramics are made (Q2)
, and there’ll be equipment and materials for children to have a go themselves.
Last time they ran the event, there was a film about painting, which went down very well with the children, and they’re now working on one about
sculpture
.
SUE:
I like the sound of that.
And what other events happen in Burnham?
MARTIN:
Well, do you all enjoy listening to music?
SUE:
Oh, yes.
MARTIN:
Well there are several free concerts taking place at different times – one or two in the morning,
the majority at lunchtime (Q3)
, and a couple in the evening.
And they range from pop music to Latin American.
SUE:
The Latin American could be fun.
What time is that?
MARTIN:
It’s being repeated several times, in different places.
They’re performing in the central library at 1 o’clock,
then at 4 it’s in the City Museum (Q4)
, and in the evening, at 7:30, there’s a longer concert, in the theatre.
SUE:
Right.
I’ll suggest that to the rest of the family.
MARTIN:
Something else you might be interested in is the boat race along the river.
SUE:
Oh, yes, do tell me about that.
MARTIN:
The race starts at Offord Marina (Q5)
, to the north of Burnham, and goes as far as Summer Pool.
The best place to watch it from is Charlesworth Bridge, though that does get rather crowded.
SUE:
And who’s taking part?
MARTIN:
Well, local boat clubs, but the standard is very high.
One of them came first in the West of England regional
championship
in May this year (Q6)
– it was the first time a team from Burnham has won.
It means that next year they’ll be representing the region in the national
championship
.
SUE:
Now I’ve heard something about Paxton Nature Reserve.
It’s a good place for spotting unusual
birds (Q7)
, isn’t it?
MARTIN:
That’s right – throughout the year.
There is a lake there, as well as a river, and they provide a very attractive habitat.
So it’s a good idea to bring
binoculars
if you have them.
And just at the moment you can see various
flowers (Q8)
that are pretty unusual – the soil at Paxton isn’t very common.
They’re looking good right now.
SUE:
Right.
My husband will be particularly interested in that.
MARTIN:
And there’s going to be a talk and slide show about
mushrooms (Q9)
– and you’ll be able to qo out and pick some afterwards and study the different varieties.
SUE:
Uhuh.
And is it possible for children to swim in the
river (Q10)
?
MARTIN:
Yes.
Part of it has been fenced off to make it safe for children to swim in.
It’s very shallow, and there’s a lifeguard on duty whenever it’s open.
The lake is too deep, so swimming isn’t allowed there.
SUE:
OK, we must remember to bring their swimming things, in case we go to Paxton.
How long does it take to get there by car from Burnham?
MARTIN:
About 20 minutes, but parking is very limited, so it’s usually much easier to go by bus – and it takes about the same time.
SUE:
Right.
Well, I’ll discuss the options with the rest of the family.
Thanks very much for all your help.
MARTIN:
You’re welcome.
SUE:
Goodbye.
MARTIN:
Bye.

Q3
ADVISER: You’re working on it? Fine… and what will be your occupation while you’re in the UK?
STUDENT: Studying English?
ADVISER: And what would you say your level of English is?
STUDENT: Umm. Good, I think I’d like to say ‘advanced’ but my written work is below the level of my spoken, so I suppose it’s
intermediate

剑桥雅思7Test2听力Section4答案解析 Left and Right Handedness in Sport
剑7 test 2 Section 4
雅思听力
原文
My topic is handedness – whether in different sports it is better to be left- or right-sided or whether a more balanced approach is more successful. I’m left-handed myself and I actually didn’t see any relevance to my own life when I happened to start reading an article by a sports psychologist called Peter Matthews. He spent the first part of the article talking about handedness in music instead of sport, which I have to say almost put me off from reading further. But what I soon became struck by
was the sheer volume
of both observation and investigation he had done in many different sports and I felt persuaded that what he had to say would be of real interest. I think Matthews’ findings will be beneficial, not so much in helping sportspeople to work on their weaker side, but more that they
can help them
identify the most suitable strategies to use in a given game. Although most trainers know how important handedness is, at present they
are rather reluctant to make use of the insights
scientists like Matthews can give, which I think is rather short-sighted because focusing on individual flexibility is only part of the story.
Q31 Q32 Q33
Anyway, back to the article.
Matthews found a German study which looked at what he called ‘mixed-handedness’, that is, the capacity to use both left and right hands equally. It looked at mixed-handedness in 40musicians on a variety of instruments. Researchers examined a number of variables, e.g. type of instrument played, regularity of practice undertaken and length of time playing instrument… and found the following: keyboard players had high levels of mixed-handedness, whereas string players like cellists and violinists strongly favoured one hand. Also those who
started younger were more mixed-handed
.
Q34
Matthews also reports studies of handedness in apes. Apes get a large proportion of their food by ‘fishing’ ants from ant hills. The studies show that apes, like humans, show handedness – though for them right- and left-handedness is about equal, whereas about 85%of humans are right-handed. Studies showed
that apes consistently using the same hand fished out 30% more ants
than those varying between the two.
Q35
Matthews started researching several different sports and found different types of handedness in each. By the way, he uses ‘handedness’. to refer to the dominant side for feet and eyes as well as hands. Anyway, his team measured the hand, feet and eyes of 2,611 players and found that there were really three main types of laterality: mixed – you work equally well on both sides – both hand and eye; single – you tend to favour one side but both hand and eye favour the same side; and cross-laterality – a player’s hands and eyes favour only one side but they are opposite sides. Let’s start with hockey. Matthews found that it was best to be mixed-handed – this is because a hockey stick must be deployed in
two directions
– it would be a drawback to have hand or eye favouring one side. An interesting finding is that mixed-handed hockey players were significantly
more confident
than their single-handed counterparts. Things are slightly different in racket sports like tennis. Here the important thing is to have the dominant hand and eye on the one side. This means that there is
a bigger area of vision
on the side where most of the action occurs. If a player is cross lateral the racket is invisible from the dominant eye for much of the swing. It means that they
can only make corrections
much later… and often the damage has been done by then.
Q36 Q37 Q38 Q39
And moving to a rather different type of sport which involves large but precise movements gymnastics. It’s been found that cross hand-eye favouring is best. The predominant reason for this is
because it aids balance
– which is of course absolutely central to performance in this sport.

剑桥雅思7Test1听力Section3答案解析 differences between individuals in the workplace
剑7 test 1 Section 3
雅思听力
原文
TUTOR: Well, you’ve both been looking at different styles of managing individuals in companies and the workplace. How’s the research going, Philip?
PHILIP: Well, I’ve been looking at why individualism, I mean individual differences, are such an important area of management studies. When you think about any organization, be it a family business or a multinational company, they are all fundamentally a group of people working together. But it’s what these individuals contribute to their places of work that makes you realize how important they are. Of course they bring different ideas,
but it’s also their attitudes
and their experiences of learning. Diversity is important in these areas too.
Q21
TUTOR: So why do people behave so differently from one another at work?
PHILIP: There are lots of reasons but research has shown a lot of it comes down to personality. And the other factor is
gender
. It’s a well known fact that men and women do lots of things in different ways, and the workplace is no different.
Q22
TUTOR: Did you look at the effects of this variation on companies?
PHILIP: Yes, I did. On the positive side, exposure to such diversity helps
encourage creativity
which is generally an asset to a company. But unfortunately individual differences are also the root of conflict between staff and they can lead to difficulties for management, which can sometimes be serious.
Q23
TUTOR: Thanks, Philip. So now I guess the two main things to remember here are to identify individual talent and then to utilize it. So Janice, you were looking at identifying different talents in workers. Do you think this is easy for managers to do?
JANICE: Well, currently teamwork is in fashion in the workplace and in my opinion the importance of the individual is generally neglected. What
managers should be targeting is those employees who can take the lead in a situation
and are not afraid to accept the idea of responsibility.
Q24
TUTOR: That’s true Janice but unfortunately many managers think the entire notion of encouraging individuality amongst their staff is far too hard.
JANICE: Yes, that may be true but I think one of the most important tasks of managers is
to consider the needs of the individual on one hand and group co-operation and conformity on the other
. It requires creative thinking on the part of management to avoid tension.
Q25
TUTOR: So Janice, what kind of people do you think companies should be looking for?
JANICE: Well, it has to start from the very beginning when companies are looking for new employees. When the personnel department is choosing between applicants they need to look for someone who’s broken the mould and
can think for themselves
. Instead, people making these decisions often use a range of psychological tests to see if a person is a problem solver, or will do as they’re told. I’m not convinced these qualities are actually the most important.
Q26
TUTOR: So do you think being a good team player is overrated?
JANICE: No, it’s not overrated. You do need to learn the rules and learn them fast. No individual can get around this if you’re working in an organization.
TUTOR: So how should managers deal with this?
JANICE: Rewards. When an individual demonstrates the behaviour the organisation expects, some kind of incentive can be given. What’s important here is that
this happens right at the beginning
so new recruits learn the rules of the system immediately. Also the incentive should be something the individual actually wants, and this isn’t always just money.
Q27
TUTOR: To come back to you, Philip. You were saying that recognition of good performers is essential. What else should managers be looking for?
PHILIP: Well, managing people means you not only have an understanding of your employees, but you also
recognise the culture
of the organization. In fact, for some organizations creativity and individuality may be the last thing they want to see during working hours!
Q28
TUTOR: Very true.
PHILIP: Yes, but managing people isn’t as easy as it looks. For example, change in the workplace can be quite tricky, especially if there’s a need to increase profit. And at times like these managers may have to give
priority to profit
rather than individual staff needs.
Q29
TUTOR: Yes, and that creates difficult situations for people.
PHILIP: Yes but what’s important is that managers are able to deal with quite high levels of
personal stress
Q30
. During times of change they should be thinking not only about the strain on their staff but take time out to think of themselves.
TUTOR: Absolutely. So what are the implications of that for…

JACK:                      Lucy, we really need to get working on this marketing assignment. We’ve only got five weeks left to the end of term to design it, carry it out, and then write up the results.
LUCY:                      Sure. Well, let’s get started right now. Let’s go over the instructions. What exactly do we have to do?
JACK:                      Well, it says here we have to look at one area of the
entertainment industry
. There’s a list of the different types.
Q21
LUCY:                      What are they?
JACK:                      Music, cinema, theatre, sport, and eating out.
LUCY:                      Is that all?
JACK:                      Looks like it.
LUCY:                      So we choose one branch of the industry and then we look at how two different groups of people use it? Is that right?
JACK:                      Yes.
LUCY:                      And do we have to use any particular method to get our data? Can we mail out a questionnaire, or do face-to-face interviews, or maybe even observations?
JACK:                      Well actually, it looks like we don’t have a choice. We have to do
telephone interviews
.
Q22
LUCY:                      OK, so at least we don’t have to waste time deciding between the different methods.
JACK:                      Yeah, that’s right. Oh, and the other requirement is the number of interviewees.
LUCY:                      Not too many, I hope. Ten? Twenty?
JACK:                      Well, we have to do two groups, remember, and it looks like we have to interview fifteen for each group.
LUCY:                      That’s
thirty
altogether then. It’s going to take ages.
Q23
JACK:                      Yes, but remember we’re working on this together, so we’ll only have to do fifteen each.
LUCY:                      OK, so those are all the requirements?
JACK:                      Yes, looks like it.
LUCY:                      So, first, which area are we going to choose? My preference would be cinema, since that’s where I spend most of my money.
JACK:                      Hmm, I don’t think that’s such a good idea. I don’t think there are huge differences in the market there. I mean you get young and old, male and female, rich and poor all going to the same movies.
LUCY:                      Yeah, maybe you’re right. Let’s make it music then.
JACK:                      Right. So, what two groups will we compare and contrast?
LUCY:
Male and female
?
Q24
JACK:                      No. Most of my female friends like the same music as me. Different age groups would be much more likely to show up differences, I think.
LUCY:                      Yeah, I suppose you’re right again. I’ll take some notes, shall I? So… Age Groups. Well. What do you think? Maybe twenty-five or under for one group, and forty-five or over for the other group? That should show up differences.
JACK:                      Right.
LUCY:                      OK. Next. How about the kind of music they like – let’s give them some choices and then we can just tick boxes.
JACK:                      OK. Let’s have pop,
jazz
, folk, easy listening… What else?
Q25
LUCY:                      Well, we should include
classical
. Some people like it, you know.
Q26
JACK:                      OK. OK. And then we should have how they listen to music.
LUCY:                      The medium. Right. Let’s include radio, CD – and then I guess there’s TV.
JACK:                      What about
concerts
? You know, in pubs and halls.
Q27
LUCY:                      Oh yeah, we should include live music of course.
JACK:                      OK, we’re on a roll now! Next point could be about where they actually get their music.
LUCY:                      You mean like, do they buy it in music shops, or
department stores
?
Q28
JACK:                      Yes, or download it from the Internet.
LUCY:                      Right. That could be for recorded music. Then we need another section for live music. Where do they go for that?
JACK：                   OK. Let’s say disco, pub,
club
, concert hall…
Q29
LUCY:                      Or
opera house
! And I guess we should include karaoke bars.
Q30
JACK:                      Not many of them in this city!
LUCY:                      OK. We’ll leave that out then. So, what’s left to do?
JACK:                      That’s it. Well, now we can make a time-scale for doing it.

剑桥雅思7Test1听力Section2答案解析 PS Camping
剑7 test 1 Section 2
雅思听力
原文
Thank you all for coming to my talk this evening. It’s nice to see so many people in the audience. For those of you who don’t know very much about PS Camping, let me start by giving you some background information about the company.
The company started twenty-five years ago. It actually opened as a retail chain selling camping equipment, and
then twenty years ago, it bought a small number of campsites in the UK, and began offering camping holidays
. The company grew rapidly and has been providing holidays in continental Europe for the last fifteen years.
Q11
If you book a camping holiday with us, you’ll have a choice of over three hundred sites. In Italy we now have some 64 sites that we either own, or have exclusive use of.
France is where we have the majority of sites
, and we currently have a project to expand into Switzerland. We also have a number of sites in Northern Spain, particularly in the mountainous region of Picos de Europa. We’ve upgraded all these Spanish sites, and improved them considerably from their original three-star rating.
Q12
We believe our holidays offer superb facilities for the whole family. Parents who want their children to be fully occupied for all or part of the day can take advantage of our children’s activities. These are organised by our well-qualified and enthusiastic staff. Each day kicks off with a sports match, perhaps football, or volleyball,
followed by an hour of drama
for everyone. This may include singing or dancing, mime or other activities. In the afternoon, there’s a different art activity for each day of the week including a poster competition or model making. What’s more, our sites are truly child-friendly, and, with this in mind, we operate a no-noise rule in the evenings. Children’s evening activities usually finish at 9.30, or occasionally 10, and
from 10.30 holiday-makers are expected to be quiet
in the areas where there are tents.
Q13 Q14
We want nothing to go wrong on a PS Camping holiday, but if it does, we also want all customers to be insured. If you haven’t organised an annual insurance policy of your own you’ll need to take out the low-cost cover we offer and
we require that you arrange this when you make your holiday reservation
.
Q15
There are many advantages to choosing PS Camping, and to recommending it to others. As a regular customer, you’ll be kept informed of special offers, and your friends can benefit from ten per cent off their holiday, or book a luxury tent for the price of a standard one. In return, we’ll send you
a thank-you present
, which you can choose from a list of high-quality items.
Q16
When it comes to our tents, these are equipped to the highest standard. We really do think of every essential detail, from an oven and cooking rings fuelled by bottled gas, to mirrors in the bedroom areas. If you don’t want to cook indoors,
you can borrow a barbecue if you ask
in advance for one to be made available, and there’s even a picnic blanket to sit on outside your tent.
Inside, a box of games and toys can be found
, and children’s tents can be hired if required. All tents have a fridge, and if you want to spend the day on the beach, for example,
ask for a specially designed PS Camping cool box
, which will keep your food and drinks chilled. There are excellent washing facilities at all our sites, with washing machines and clothes lines
in the central areas, along with mops and buckets
in case your tent needs cleaning during your stay. All sites have a cafe and/or a shop for those who’d rather ‘eat in’ than dine at a local restaurant.

原文
VICTOR
: Right, well, for our presentation shall I start with the early life of
Thor
Heyerdahl?
OLIVIA
: Sure.
Why don’t you begin with describing the type of boy he was, especially –
his passion for collecting things  (Q21)
.
VICTOR
: That’s right, he had his own little museum.
And I think it’s unusual for children to develop their own values and not join in their parents’ hobbies;
I’m thinking of how Heyerdahl wouldn’t go hunting with his dad, for example.
OLIVIA
: Yeah, he preferred to learn about nature by listening to his mother read to him.
And quite early on he knew he wanted to become an explorer when he grew up.
That came from his camping trips he went on in Norway I think…
VICTOR
: No, –
it was climbing that he spent his time on as a young man (Q22)
.
OLIVIA
: Oh, right…
After university he married a classmate and together, – they decided to experience living on a small island, – to
find out how
harsh
weather conditions shaped people’s lifestyles (Q23)
.
VICTOR
: As part of their preparation before they left home, they learnt basic survival skills tike building a
shelter
.
I guess they needed that knowledge
in order to live wild in a remote location with few inhabitants, cut off by the sea (Q24)
, which is what they were aiming to do.
OLIVIA
: An important part of your talk should be the
radical
theory Heyerdahl formed from examining
mysterious
ancient carvings that he happened to find on the island.
I think you should finish with that.
VICTOR:OK.
OLIVIA
: All right, Victor, so after your part I’ll talk about
Thor
Heyerdahl’s adult life, continuing from the theory he had about
Polynesian
migration
.
Up until that time of course, academics had believed that humans first migrated to the islands in Polynesia from Asia, in the west.
VICTOR
: Yes,
they thought that travel from the east was impossible, because of the huge, empty stretch of ocean that lies between the islands and the nearest inhabited land (Q25)
.
OLIVIA
: Yes, but Heyerdahl spent ages studying the cloud movements, ocean currents and wind patterns to find if it was actually possible.
And another argument was that there was no tradition of large ship-building in the communities lying to the east of Polynesia.
But Heyerdahl knew they made lots of
coastal
voyages in locally built canoes.
VICTOR
: Yes, or sailing on rafts, as was shown by the long voyage that Heyerdahl did next.
It was an
incredibly
risky journey to undertake—sometimes I wonder if he did that trip for private reasons, you know?
To show others that he could have
spectacular
adventures.
What do you think, Olivia?
OLIVIA
: Well,
I think it was more a matter of simply trying out his idea, to see if
migration
from the east was possible (Q26)
.
VICTOR
: Yes, that’s probably it.
And the poor guy suffered a bit at that time because the war forced him to stop his work for some years…
OLIVIA
: Yes.
When he got started again and planned his
epic
voyage, do you think it was important to him that he achieve it before anyone else did?
VICTOR
: Um, I haven’t read anywhere that that was his motivation.
The most important factor seems to have been that he use only ancient techniques and local materials to build his
raft (Q27
)
.
OLIVIA
: Yes.
I wonder how fast it went.
VICTOR
: Well, it took them 97 days from South America to the
Pacific
Islands.
OLIVIA
: Mm.
And after that, Heyerdahl went to Easter Island, didn’t he?
We should the purpose of that trip.
I think he sailed there in a boat made out of reeds.
VICTOR
: No, that was later on in Egypt, Olivia.
OLIVIA
: Oh, yes, that’s right.
VICTOR
: But
what he wanted to do was talk to the local people about their old stone carvings and then make one himself to learn more about the process (Q28)
.
OLIVIA
: I see.
Well, what a great life.
Even though many of his theories have been disproven, he certainly left a lasting impression on many disciplines, didn’t he?
To my mind, he was the first person to establish what modem academics call practical
archaeology (Q29)
.
I mean, that they try to recreate something from the past today, like he did with his
raft
trip.
It’s unfortunate that his ideas about where Polynesians originated from have been completely discredited.
VICTOR
: Yes.
Right, well, I’ll prepare a PowerPoint slide at the end that acknowledges our sources.
I mainly used The Life and Work of
Thor
Heyerdahl by William Oliver.
I thought the research methods he used were very sound, although I must say
I found the overall tone somewhat old-fashioned (Q30)
.
I think they need to do a new, revised edition.
OLIVIA
: Yeah.
I agree.
What about the subject matter—I found it realty challenging!
VICTOR
: Well, it’s a complex issue…
OLIVIA
: I thought the book had lots of good points.
What did you think of…

原文
WOMAN:
Jack, I’m thinking of taking the kids to the seaside on a surfing holiday this summer and I wanted to ask your advice – as I know you’re such an expert.
JAKE:
Well, I don’t know about that, but yes, I’ve done a bit of surfing over the years. I’d thoroughly recommend it. I think it’s the kind of holiday all the
family (Q1)
can enjoy together. The thing about surfing is that it’s great for all ages and all abilities. My youngest started when he was only three!
WOMAN:
Wow! But it’s quite physically demanding, isn’t it? I’ve heard you need to be pretty
fit (Q2)
.
JAKE:
Yes. You’ll certainly learn more quickly and won’t tire as easily.
WOMAN:
Well – that should be OK for us. You’ve been surfing a few times in Ireland, haven’t you?
JAKE:
Yes. There’s some great surfing there, which people don’t always realise.
WOMAN:
And which locations would you recommend? – there seem to be quite a few.
JAKE:
Yes, there are loads. Last year we went to County Donegal. There are several great places to surf there.
WOMAN:
What about in County Clare? I read that’s also really good for surfing.
JAKE:
Yes, it is. I’ve been there a few times. Most people go to Lahinch. My kids love it there. The waves aren’t too challenging and the town is very lively.
WOMAN:
Are there good
hotels (Q3)
there?
JAKE:
Yes – some very nice ones and there are also a few basic hostels and campsites. It’s great if you need lessons as the surf schools are excellent.
WOMAN:
Sounds good.
JAKE:
Yes and there’s lots to see in the area – like those well-known cliffs – … I’ve forgotten the name of them …
WOMAN:
Oh don’t worry – I can look them up.
JAKE:
I’ve also been surfing in County Mayo, which is less well-known for surfing, but we had a really good time. That was a few years ago when the kids were younger. There’s a good surf school at Carrowniskey beach.
WOMAN:
How do you spell that?
JAKE:
C-A-double R-O-W-N-I-S-K-E-Y (Q4)
WOMAN:
OK
JAKE:
I put the kids into the surf camp they run during the summer for 10–16 year olds.
WOMAN:
Oh right. How long was that for?
JAKE:
Three hours every day for a
week (Q5)
. It was perfect – they were so tired out after that.
WOMAN:
I can imagine.
JAKE:
One thing we did while the kids were surfing was to rent some kayaks to have a look around the
bay (Q6)
which is nearby. It’s really beautiful.
WOMAN:
Oh, I’d love to do that.
WOMAN:
Now the only time I went to Ireland it rained practically every day.
JAKE:
Mmm yes – that can be a problem – but you can surf in the rain, you know.
WOMAN:
It doesn’t have the same appeal, somehow.
JAKE:
Well, the weather’s been fine the last couple of years when I’ve been there, but actually, it tends to rain more in August than in the spring or autumn.
September (Q7)
is my favourite month because the water is warmer then.
WOMAN:
The only problem is that the kids are back to school then.
JAKE:
I know. But one good thing about Irish summers is that it doesn’t get
too
hot. The average temperature is about
19 (Q8)
degrees and it usually doesn’t go above 25 degrees.
WOMAN:
That sounds alright. Now what about costs?
JAKE:
Surfing is a pretty cheap holiday really – the only cost is the hire of equipment. You can expect to pay a daily rate of about
30 (Q9)
euros for the hire of a wetsuit and board – but you can save about 40 euros if you hire by the week.
WOMAN:
That’s not too bad.
JAKE:
No. It’s important to make sure you get good quality wetsuits – you’ll all get too cold if you don’t. And make sure you also get
boots (Q10)
. They keep your feet warm and it’s easier to surf with them on too.
WOMAN:
Well, thanks very much …

剑6 test 3 Section 2
雅思听力
原文
Welcome, everybody, to the lovely house and gardens of Rosewood, once the home of the famous writer, Sebastian George. He bought the house in 1902 although he had first seen it two years earlier. At that time the owners let it out to a tenant because
George was too slow making up his mind to buy it
. When it came back on the market, there was no hesitation and he bought it immediately, for ￡9,300, even though the house had no bathroom, no running water upstairs, and no electricity.
Q11
When he came here, he’d been married for ten years. During that time, he’d become one of the most famous writers in the English-speaking world. His professional success was enormous, but
his personal life wasn’t as successful. He was no longer on speaking terms with his brother and had been devastated by the death at the age of seven of his elder daughter, Josephine
.
Q12
Moving to Rosewood allowed the family to start a new life.
George regarded Rosewood as a pure example of a traditional country house of this part of England
and did some of his most successful writing here. The house and its grounds became the family haven and their escape to privacy and quiet. The walls, and the mullioned windows were built of the local sandstone, the tiles on the roofs and the bricks of the chimney stack were baked from local clay, and the wooden structures inside came from oak trees which grow around here.
Q13
Now, please look at the map I’ve given you of the house and gardens. We’re here at the Information Centre. Follow the path marked with the arrow and the first area you come to is the orchard on your left.
As you go further down the path, there’s the kitchen garden on the right and as you go round the first sharp corner you will find, to your left, an area where different types of pear tree have been planted as well as some lovely flowers, and this is known as
Pear Alley
-designed by George himself.
Q14
Next to this is the greenhouse where some exotic plants and fruits are grown. Follow the path round the second corner and on your right you will see the entrance to the
Mulberry Garden
with its 500-year-old tree. Past the Mulberry Garden, follow the path until you reach the front of the house. I suggest you spend a good hour wandering around this lovely building. A guide takes visitor groups round every two hours.
Q15
If you would like to purchase any of George’s books or other souvenirs, then leave the house by the side entrance, where you will find our
shop
, which is situated between the house and the garage which contains the magnificent old Rolls-Royce car which used to belong to George. I expect by this time you may also be in need of a rest and some refreshment. Most visitors are, so why don’t you visit
the tea room
on the far side of the garage?
Q16   Q17
If you have time, there is a lovely walk down towards the River Dudwell. For me, this is the best part of the estate. This isn’t on the map but it is all clearly signposted. You cross the
field
which spreads along the banks of the river. In spring, this area is well worth a visit. Spend a minute or two watching the water pass by underneath as you cross the
footbridge
, and then continue along the River Walk through the woodland. On a hot summer’s day the trees along this path provide welcome shade. Eventually you come to the water mill which used to provide the electricity for the house – only about four hours every evening – in George’s time. And, finally, for those of you who would like to see stunning views of the surrounding countryside and who are a little bit more energetic, when you return from the mill take the first turning on your left and climb up to the
viewpoint
. You won’t regret it.

剑桥雅思15 Test4 Part2
雅思听力
原文
As chair of the town council subcommittee on park facilities, I’d like to bring you up to date on some of the changes that have been made recently to the Croft Valley Park. So if you could. just take a look at the map I handed out, let’s begin with a general overview. So the basic arrangement of the park hasn’t changed -it still has two gates, north and south, and a lake in the middle.
The café continues to serve an assortment of drinks and snacks and is still in the same place,
looking out over the lake and next to the old museum (Q11)
.
We’re hoping to change the location of the toilets, and bring them nearer to the centre of the park as they’re a bit out of the way at present,
near the adventure playground, in the corner of your map (Q12)
.
The formal gardens have been replanted and should be at their best in a month or two. They used to be behind the old museum, but we’ve now used
the space near the south gate – between the park boundary and the path that goes past the lake towards the old museum (Q13)
.
We have a new outdoor gym for adults and children, which is already proving very popular It’s
by the glass houses, just to the right of the path from the south gate. You have to look for it as it’s a bit hidden in the trees (Q14)
.
One very successful introduction has been our skateboard ramp. It’s in constant use during the evenings and holidays. It’s
near the old museum, at the end of a little path that leads off from the main path between the lake and the museum (Q15)
.
We’ve also introduced a new area for wild flowers, to attract bees and butterflies. It’s
on a bend in the path that goes round the east side of the lake, just south of the adventure playground (Q16)
.
Now let me tell you a bit more about some of the changes to Croft Valley Park.
One of our most exciting developments has been the adventure playground. We were aware that we had nowhere for children to let off steam, and decided to use our available funds to set up a completely new facility in a large space to the north of the park. It’s open year-round, though it closes early in the winter months, and
entrance is completely free (Q17)
. Children can choose whatever activities they want to do, irrespective of their age, but
we do ask adults not to leave them on their own there (Q18)
. There are plenty of seats where parents can relax and keep an eye on their children at the same time.
Lastly, the glass houses. A huge amount of work has been done on them to repair the
damage following the disastrous fire that recently destroyed their western side (Q19)
. Over £80,000 was spent on replacing the glass walls and the metal supports, as well as the plants that had been destroyed, although unfortunately, the collection of tropical palm trees has proved too expensive to replace up to now. At present the glass houses are open from 10am to 3pm
Mondays to Thursdays, and it’s hoped to extend this to the weekend soon (Q20)
. We’re grateful to all those who helped us by contributing their time and money to this achievement.
The gardens have…

DIANA:
So, Tim, we have to do a short summary of our work experience on a farm.
TIM:
Right. My farm was great, but
arranging the work experience was hard (Q21)
. One problem was it was miles away and I don’t drive. And also, I’d really wanted a placement for a month, but I could only get one for two weeks.
DIANA:
I was lucky, the farmer let me stay on the farm so I didn’t have to travel. But
finding the right sort of farm to apply to wasn’t easy (Q21)
.
TIM:
No, they don’t seem to have websites, do they. I found mine through a friend of my mother’s, but it wasn’t easy.
DIANA:
No.
TIM:
My farm was mostly livestock, especially sheep. I really enjoyed helping out with them.
I was up most of one night helping a sheep deliver a lamb … (Q22)
DIANA:
On your own?
TIM:
No, the farmer was there, and he told me what to do. It wasn’t a straightforward birth, but I managed. It was a great feeling to see the lamb stagger to its feet and start feeding almost straight away, and to know that it was OK.
DIANA:
Mm.
TIM:
Then another time a lamb had broken its leg, and they got the vet in to set it, and he talked me through what he was doing. That was really useful.
DIANA:
Yes, my farm had sheep too. The farm was in a valley and they had a lowland breed called Suffolks, although the farmer said they’d had other breeds in the past.
TIM:
So were they bred for their meat? (Q23)
DIANA:
Mostly, yes (Q23)
. They’re quite big and solid.
TIM:
My farm was up in the hills and they had a different breed of sheep, they were Cheviots.
DIANA:
Oh, I heard their wool’s really sought after.
TIM:
Yes. It’s very hardwearing and they use it for carpets.
DIANA:
Right.
TIM:
I was interested in the amount of supplements they add to animals’ feed nowadays. Like, even the chickens got extra vitamins and electrolytes in their feed.
DIANA:
Yes, I found that too. And they’re not cheap. But my farmer said some are overpriced for what they are. And
he didn’t give them as a matter of routine, just at times when the chickens seemed to particularly require them (Q24)
.
TIM:
Yes, mine said the same. He said certain breeds of chickens might need more supplements than the others, but the cheap and expensive ones are all basically the same.
DIANA:
Mm.
TIM:
So did your farm have any other livestock, Diana?
DIANA:
Yes, dairy cows. I made a really embarrassing mistake when I was working in the milk shed. Some cows had been treated with antibiotics, so their milk wasn’t suitable for human consumption, and  it had to be put in a separate container. But
I got mixed up, and I poured some milk from the wrong cow in with the milk for humans, so the whole lot had to be thrown away (Q25)
. The farmer wasn’t too happy with me.
TIM:
I asked my farmer how much he depended on the vet to deal with health problems. I’d read reports that the livestock’s health is being affected as farmers are under pressure to increase production. Well, he didn’t agree with that, but he said that actually
some of the stuff the vets do, like minor operations, he’d be
quite capable of doing himself (Q26)
.
DIANA:
Yeah. My farmer said the same (Q26).
But he reckons vets’ skills are still needed.
DIANA:
Now we’ve got to give a bit of feedback about last term’s modules – just short comments, apparently. Shall we do that now?
TIM:
OK. So medical terminology.
DIANA:
Well, my heart sank when I saw that, especially right at the beginning of the course. And I did struggle with it.
TIM:
I’d thought it’d be hard, but actually I found it all quite straightforward (Q27)
. What did you think about diet and nutrition?
DIANA:
OK, I suppose.
TIM:
Do you remember what they told us about pet food and the fact that
there’s such limited checking into whether or not it’s contaminated? I mean in comparison with the checks on food for humans – I thought that was terrible (Q28)
.
DIANA:
Mm. I think the module that really impressed me was the animal disease one, when we looked at domesticated animals in different parts of the world, like camels and water buffalo and alpaca.
The economies of so many countries depend on these, but scientists don’t know much about the diseases that affect them (Q29)
.
TIM:
Yes,
I thought they’d know a lot about ways of controlling and eradicating those diseases, but that’s not the case at all (Q29)
. I loved the wildlife medication unit. Things like helping birds that have been caught in oil spills. That’s something I hadn’t thought about before.
DIANA:
Yeah,
I thought I might write my dissertation on something connected with that (Q30)
.
TIM:
Right. So …

剑桥雅思15 test3 Part2
雅思听力
原文
PRESENTER:
My guest on the show today is Alice Riches who started the Street Play Scheme where she lives in Beechwood Road. For those of you that don’t already know – Street Play involves local residents closing off their street for a few hours so that children have a chance to play in the street safely. She started it in her own street, Beechwood Road, and the idea caught on, and there are now Street Play Schemes all over the city. So when did you actually start the scheme, Alice?
ALICE:
Well, I first had the idea when my oldest child was still a toddler, so that’s about six years ago now – but it took at least two years of campaigning before we were actually able to make it happen.
So the scheme’s been up and running for three years now (Q11)
. We’d love to be able to close our road for longer – for the whole weekend, from Saturday morning until Sunday evening, for example.
At the moment it’s just once a week (Q12)
. But when we started it was only once a month. But we’re working on it.
PRESENTER:
So what actually happens when Beechwood Road is closed?
ALICE:
We have
volunteer wardens, mostly parents but some elderly residents too, who block off our road at either end (Q13)
. The council have provided special signs but there’s always a volunteer there to explain what’s happening to any motorists. Generally, they’re fine about it – we’ve only had to get the police involved once or twice.
Now I should explain that the road isn’t completely closed to cars. But only residents’ cars are allowed. If people really need to get in or out of Beechwood Road, it’s not a problem-
as long as they drive at under 20 kilometres per hour (Q14)
. But most people just decide not to use their cars during this time, or they park in another street. The wardens are only there to stop through traffic.
PRESENTER:
So can anyone apply to get involved in Street Play?
ALICE:
Absolutely -we want to include all kids
in the city – especially those who live on busy roads (Q15)
. It’s here that demand is greatest. Obviously, there isn’t such demand in wealthier areas where the children have access to parks or large gardens-or in the suburbs where there are usually more places for children to play outside.
I’d recommend that anyone listening who likes the idea should just give it a go. We’ve been surprised by the positive reaction of residents all over the city. And that’s not just parents. There are always a few who complain but they’re a tiny minority. On the whole everyone is very supportive and say
they’re very happy to see children out on the street (Q16)
– even if it does get quite noisy.
There have been so many benefits of Street Play for the kids. Parents really like the fact that the kids are getting fresh air instead of sitting staring at a computer screen, even if they’re not doing anything particularly energetic. And of course it’s great that kids can play with their friends outside without being supervised by their parents- but for me the biggest advantage is that kids
develop confidence in themselves to be outside without their parents (Q17)
. The other really fantastic thing is that children get
to know the adults in the street – it’s like having a big extended family (Q18)
.
PRESENTER:
It certainly does have a lot of benefits. I want to move on now and ask you about a related project in King Street.
ALICE:
Right.Well, this was an experiment I was involved in where local residents decided to try and reduce the traffic along King Street, which is the busiest main road in our area, by persuading people not to use their cars for one day. We thought about making people pay more for parking-but we decided that would be really unpopular-so instead we just stopped people from parking on King Street but left the other car parks open.
It was surprising how much of a difference all this made. As we’d predicted, air quality was significantly better but what I hadn’t expected was
how much quieter it would be (Q19)
– even with the buses still running. Of course everyone said they felt safer but we were actually amazed that
sales in the shops went up considerably that day (Q20)
– we thought there’d be fewer people out shopping-not more.
PRESENTER:
That’s really interesting so the fact that.

原文
WOMAN: Good morning, oh sorry, it’s gone 12, I’ll start again, good afternoon,
Kingswell Sports Club
, how can I help you?
Example
MAN: Oh, good afternoon. I was wondering if you could give me some information about membership and facilities.
WOMAN: Of course. What would you like to know?
MAN: Do you have tennis courts, for example?
WOMAN: No, I’m afraid we don’t. We’re primarily a golf club.
MAN: What about football? I heard you had a team.
WOMAN: No, I’m sorry. Perhaps you’re thinking about Fresham Sports Centre.
MAN: Oh, right. I know it. I’ve played badminton there.
WOMAN: Have you? They’ve got a lot of facilities we don’t have and vice versa. We do have
a keep-fit studio
, which is very popular with members, and then as well as that there’s
swimming
, of course.
Q1   Q2
MAN: That’s good. I like to swim every day.
WOMAN: We have a range of classes too.
MAN: Do you have judo classes? I’m keen to learn.
WOMAN: Well, at the moment we offer kick-boxing. We’re planning to add judo and stretch classes soon. We’re currently running a range of
yoga classes
, too.
Q3
MAN: What about relaxing after exercise? I assume you have a restaurant or something.
WOMAN: At the moment, we’ve got
a salad bar
which is very popular. We’ll also have a fully-licensed restaurant by the end of the year.
Q4
MAN: Sounds good!
WOMAN: What kind of membership are you interested in?
MAN: Um I’m not really sure. What are the options?
WOMAN: Well, there are three different membership schemes.
MAN: I see. What’s the difference?
WOMAN: Well, the first one’s called Gold, and you can use all the facilities at any time of the day or week. You can also join in as many classes as you like for free.
MAN: That sounds good. Is it very expensive?
WOMAN: Well, you pay a ￡250 joining fee and then it’s ￡450 – oh no, I’m sorry, it’s just gone up by ￡50, sorry about that – it’s now
￡500
for the annual subscription fee.
Q5
MAN: Right, got that. And what’s the next type?
WOMAN: Well, that’s Silver – it’s the same as Gold except you have to pay a small fee of
￡1.00
per lesson for any you do and you can only use the centre at certain times.
Q6
MAN: I see. So when exactly?
WOMAN: You can only use the facilities
between 10 am and 4.30 pm
.
Q7
MAN: So I couldn’t use the pool at 8 in the morning or evening, then?
WOMAN: That’s right.
MAN: OK. And the price for that? Is the joining fee the same as for Gold?
WOMAN: Actually, it’s slightly less than the ￡250 – it’s ￡225, but the annual fee is only ￡300. Does that sound more like what you want?
MAN: Well, it’s still rather more expensive than I thought. I’m a student here in England and I’m only here for six months.
WOMAN: Ah, then the Bronze scheme would probably suit you best.
MAN: How is that different?
WOMAN: Well, some of the facilities have restricted use.
MAN: And do I have to pay for classes?
WOMAN: Yes, it’s ￡3 for each class you join.
MAN:  I see. And what are the hours then?
WOMAN: Between 10.30 and 3.30 weekdays only and you pay a ￡50 joining fee. The annual fee is
￡180
– it works out at ￡15 a month, so that would be quite a lot cheaper.  Q8
MAN: Oh, that should be all right. I could come in my free periods. What do I have to do if I want to join?
WOMAN: Well, we book you in for an
assessment
with an instructor, who will show you how to use all the equipment. If you want to organise a trial session and look around the centre, you’ll need to speak to David Kynchley.
Q9
MAN: Hmm. Could you spell that please?
WOMAN: Yes, David
K-Y-N-C-H-L-E-Y
. I’ll give you his direct line number. It’s oh-four-five-eight-nine-five-three-double one.    Q10
MAN: Thanks.

剑桥雅思8Test2听力Section4答案解析 Research on questions about doctors
剑8 test 2 Section 4
雅思听力
原文
I’ve been doing some research into what people in Britain think of doctors, the ones who work in general practice – the first call for medical care – and comparing this with the situation in a couple of other countries. I want to talk about the rationale behind what I decided to do.
Now I had to set up my programme of research in three different countries so
I approached postgraduates in my field in overseas departments
(
Q31
)
, contacting them by email, to organise things for me at their end. I thought I would have trouble recruiting help but in fact everyone was very willing and sometimes their tutors got involved too.
I had to give my helpers clear instructions about what kind of sample population I wanted them to use. I decided that people under 18 should be excluded because most of them are students or looking for their first job, and also I decided at this stage just to
focus on men who were in employment
(
Q32
)
, and set up something for people who didn’t have jobs and for employed women later on as a separate investigation.
I specifically wanted to do a questionnaire, and interviews with a focus group. With the questionnaire, rather than limiting it to one specific point,
I wanted to include as much variety as possible
(Q33)
. I know questionnaires are a very controlled way to do things but I thought I could do taped interviews later on to counteract the effects of this. And the focus group may also prove useful in future, by targeting subjects I can easily return to, as the participants tend to be more involved.
So I’m just collating the results now. At the moment it looks as if, in the UK,
despite the fact that newspapers continually report that people are unhappy with medical care, in fact it is mainly the third level of care, which takes place in hospitals, that they are worried about  (Q34)
. Government reforms have been proposed at all levels and although their success is not guaranteed, long-term hospital care is in fact probably less of an issue than the media would have us believe. However, I’ve still got quite a bit of data to look at.
Certainly, I will need to do more far-reaching research than I had anticipated
in order to establish if people want extra medical staff invested in the community, or if they want care to revert to fewer but larger, key medical units
(Q35)
. The solution may well be something that can be easily implemented by those responsible in local government, with central government support of course.
This first stage has proved very valuable though. I was surprised by how willing most of the subjects were to get involved in the project – I had expected some unwillingness to answer questions honestly. But I was taken aback and rather concerned that something I thought I’d set up very well
didn’t necessarily seem that way to everyone in my own department
(Q36)
.
I thought you might also be interested in some of the problems I encountered in collecting my data. There were odd cases that threw me – one of the subjects who I had approached while he was out shopping in town,
decided to pull out when it came to the second round (Q37)
. It was a shame as it was someone who I would like to have interviewed more closely. And one of the first-year students I interviewed
wanted reassurance that no names would be traceable from the answers
(Q38)
. I was so surprised, because they think nothing of telling you about themselves and their opinions in seminar groups!
Then, one of the people that I work with got a bit funny. The questions were quite personal and
one minute he said he’d do it, then the next day he wouldn’t, and in the end he did do it (Q39)
. It’s hard not to get angry in that situation but I tried to keep focused on the overall picture in order to stay calm.
The most bizarre case was a telephone interview I did with a teacher at a university in France. He answered all my questions in great detail – but then when I asked how much access he had to dangerous substances
he wouldn’t tell me exactly what his work involved (Q40)
. It’s a real eye-opener. . .

该部分介绍了某地区的节日以及在此期间三个马戏团表演的情况，属于雅思听力Section 2十分典型的场景。大家在听完之后可以积累下其中出现的各种词汇。
10道题目中易错点主要有三个。其一为第12题。一方面它跟第11题的距离很近，容易听漏；另一方面，这道题采用的theater和theatrical的同义替换比较少见，很多同学反应不过来。第二个易错点是第15题，lighting这个词发生了变音，听起来有些像lighding，很容易写错。第三个易错点是第18题。这道题前面有大段的叙述，其中提到the performers are so young，导致一些同学将young当成了答案。但实际上题目问的是观众类型，还要再往后等一点。

原文
GEOFFREY: Good evening, and in this week’s edition of ‘Focus on the Arts’, Jane Hemmington is going to fill us in on what’s in store for us at this year’s Summer Festival. Over to you, Jane.
JANE: Thank you, Geoffrey. This year, the Summer Festival is the biggest we’ve ever seen, so there should be something for everybody. This is the third year they’ve run it and the timing’s slightly different: for the last couple of years it’s been around the fifth to seventeenth, but this year they wanted to allow everyone enough time to recover from the first of January celebrations and they’ve put it
at the end of the month
.
Q11
The program has a sensational theatre, dance and also a large number of art exhibitions, but the thing the Festival is most famous for is its great street music.  For today’s report though, Geoffrey, I’m looking at some of the
theatrical events
that you might like to see; in particular, at this year’s theme – circuses.
Q12
I’m going to tell you about two circus performances, but there are
plenty of others in the program
. I’ve chosen these because they represent distinct movements within circus performance. The first is the Circus Romano from Italy. As this is a traveling circus, it follows a long tradition by performing
in a marquee
– which is really like a canvas portable building, usually put up in a green space or car park, rather than in a theatre or stadium.
Q13 Q14
In spite of this, Circus Romano isn’t at all like the traditional circuses I grew up with. There are no animals -just very talented clowning and acrobatic routines. The show has a lot of very funny moments, especially at the beginning, but the best part is
the music and
lighting
. They’re magical. At forty-five dollars it’s very expensive anyway – it’s really for
adult
tastes. In fact, much of it would be wasted on children – so I suggest you leave them at home.
Q15 Q16
The second circus performance is Circus Electrica at the
Studio Theatre
. The purists are suggesting that this isn’t a circus at all. It’s a showcase for skills in dance and magic, rather than the usual ones you expect in a circus. With only six performers it’s a small production, which suits the venue well -the Studio only seats about two hundred people. For my money, it’s the aerial displays which are outstanding as well as the magical tricks – features which are missing from Circus Romano. An interesting feature of the show is that the performers are so young – the youngest is only fourteen. But it’s still well worth seeing: a good one for
the whole family
.
Q17 Q18
And finally, as it’s summer, you may wish to see some of the Festival performances that are being presented outdoors. Like the famous Mekong Water Puppet Troupe, performing in
the City Gardens
this week. Now, water puppetry is amazing! It’s large puppets on long sticks, controlled by puppeteers standing waist-deep in the lake. The puppets do comedy routines and there is some terrific formation dancing. This is a fantastic show and the best moment comes at the end – seeing the puppeteers. When the troupe walks up out of the water, you get this amazing feeling. It’s really hard to believe that what you’ve been watching is lifeless wood and cloth. As an adult, I had a great time, but I did note that other older people in the audience weren’t quite as taken with it as I was. It’s a must for
young children
though, and that’s the audience it’s really aimed at.
Q19 Q20
Well, that’s all I’ve time for today, but I’ll be back next week with more news of what’s worth seeing and what it’s best to miss.

原文
CAROLINE:
Good Morning.
Youth Council.
Caroline speaking.
ROGER:
Oh, hello, I’m interested in standing for election to the Youth Council, and I was told to give you a call.
CAROLINE:
That’s good.
Could I have your name, please?
ROGER:
Yes, it’s Roger
(Example)
Brown.
CAROLINE:
Thank you.
I’m Caroline, the Youth Council
administrator
.
So do you know much about what the Council does, Roger?
ROGER:
I’ve talked to Stephanie – I think she’s the chair of the Council.
CAROLINE:
That’s right.
ROGER:
And she told me a lot about it.
How it’s a way for young people to discuss local issues, for example, and make suggestions to the town council.
That’s what made me interested.
CAROLINE:
Fine.
Well, let me take down some of your details.
First of all, how old are you?
You know the Council is for young people aged from 13 to 18?
ROGER:
I’ve just turned 18.
CAROLINE:
And where do you live, Roger?
ROGER:
Well, that’s a bit complicated.
At the moment I’m looking for a flat to rent here, so I’m in a
hostel (Q1)
from Monday to Friday.
I go back to my parents’ place at the weekend.
CAROLINE:
OK, SO where’s the best place to send you some information about the Council?
ROGER:
Oh, to my parents’ address, please.
That’s 17,
Buckleigh (Q2)
Street – B-U-C-K-L-E-I- G-H Street, Stamford, Lincolnshire, though you don’t really need the county.
CAROLINE:
Oh, I know Stamford – it’s a lovely town.
And what’s the postcode?
ROGER:
PE9 7QT (Q3)
CAROLINE:
Right, thank you.
So are you working here, or are you a student?
ROGER:
I started studying at the university a couple of weeks ago, and I’ve got a part-time job for a few hours a week.
CAROLINE:
What do you do?
ROGER:
Well, I’ve done several different things.
I’ve just finished a short-term
contract
as a courier, and now I’m working as a
waiter (Q4)
in one of the big hotels.
CAROLINE:
Uhuh.
That can’t leave you much time for studying!
ROGER:
Oh, it’s not too bad.
I manage to fit it all in.
CAROLINE:
What are you studying?
ROGER:
My ambition is to go into parliament
eventually
, so my major subject is
politics (Q5)
.
That’s partly why I think the Youth Council is important and want to be a part of it.
CAROLINE:
And I suppose you’re also taking a minor subject, aren’t you?
I know a lot of people study economics too.
ROGER:
I chose history.
To be honest, I’m not finding it as interesting as I expected!
CAROLINE:
OK, so with your studying and your part-time job, do you have time for any other interests or hobbies?
ROGER:
Well, I spend quite a lot of time
cycling (Q6)
– both around town to get to university and to work, and also long-distance, from here to London, for
instance
.
CAROLINE:
That’s pretty impressive!
Anything else?
ROGER:
For relaxation, I’m also keen on the
cinema (Q7)
– I used to go at least once a week, but I can’t manage to go so often now.
CAROLINE:
Right.
Are you sure you’ll have enough time for the Youth Council?
ROGER:
Yes, I’ve worked out that I can afford to reduce my hours at work, and that will make the time.
CAROLINE:
So is there any
particular
aspect of the Youth Council’s work that appeals to you, Roger?
ROGER:
Well, my sister is blind, so I’m particularly interested in working with
disabled (Q8)
young people, to try and improve the quality of their lives.
CAROLINE:
That’s great.
Well, the best way to get involved is to be nominated by some people who you know.
ROGER:
Right.
Can you tell me how to set about organising that?
CAROLINE:
You should talk to Jeffrey, our Elections Officer.
I can arrange a meeting in the council office with him, if you like.
ROGER:
Yes, please.
CAROLINE:
He’ll be here next Monday, if that suits you.
ROGER:
That’s the 14th, isn’t it?
CAROLINE:
Yes.
ROGER:
I can manage late afternoon.
CAROLINE:
Would you like to suggest a time?
He generally leaves around 5:30.
ROGER:
Well, would
4:30 (Q9)
be OK?
My last class finishes at 4, so I’d have plenty of time to get to your office.
CAROLINE:
Right, that’s fine.
Oh, and could I have a phone number we can contact you on?
ROGER:
Yes, my mobile number’s
07788 136711 (Q10)

CAROLINE:
Thank you.
Well, we’ll look forward to seeing you next week.
ROGER:
Thanks very much.

Hello, LINDA speaking.
MATT:
Oh hi, LINDA. This is Matt Brooks. Alex White gave me your number. He said you’d be able to give me some advice about moving to Banford.
LINDA:
Yes, Alex did mention you. How can I help?
MATT:
Well, first of all – which area to live in?
LINDA:
Well, I live in Dalton, which is a really nice suburb – not too expensive, and there’s a nice park. Example
MATT:
Sounds good. Do you know how much it would be to rent a two bedroom flat there?
LINDA:
Yeah, you should be able to get something reasonable for
850 (Q1)
pounds per month. That’s what people typically pay. You certainly wouldn’t want to pay more than 900 pounds. That doesn’t include bills or anything.
MATT:
No. That sounds alright. I’ll definitely have a look there. Are the transport links easy from where you live?
LINDA:
Well, I’m very lucky. I work in the city centre so I don’t have to use public transport. I go by
bike (Q2)
.
MATT:
Oh, I wish I could do that. Is it safe to cycle around the city?
LINDA:
Yes, it’s fine. And it keeps me fit. Anyway, driving to work in the city centre would be a nightmare because there’s hardly any
parking
(Q3)
. And the traffic during the rush hour can be bad.
MATT:
I’d be working from home but I’d have to go to London one or two days a week.
LINDA:
Oh, that’s perfect. Getting to London is no problem. There’s a fast train every
30 (Q4)
minutes which only takes 45 minutes.
MATT:
That’s good.
LINDA:
Yeah, the train service isn’t bad during the week. And they run quite late at night. It’s
weekends (Q5)
that are a problem. They’re always doing engineering work and you have to take a bus to Hadham and pick up the train there, which is really slow. But other than that, Banford’s a great place to live. I’ve never been happier.
LINDA:
There are some nice restaurants in the city centre and a brand new
cinema (Q6)
which has only been open a couple of months. There’s a good arts centre too. Q6
MATT:
Sounds like Banford’s got it all.
LINDA:
Yes! We’re really lucky. There are lots of really good aspects to living here. The schools are good and the
hospital (Q7)
here is one of the best in the country. Everyone I know who’s been there’s had a positive experience. Oh, I can give you the name of my
dentist (Q8)
too in Bridge Street, if you’re interested. I’ve been going to him for years and I’ve never had any problems.
MATT:
Oh, OK. Thanks!
LINDA:
I’ll find his number and send it to you.
MATT:
Thanks, that would be really helpful.
LINDA:
Are you planning to visit Banford soon?
MATT:
Yes. My wife and I are both coming next week. We want to make some appointments with estate agents.
LINDA:
I could meet you if you like and show you around.
MATT:
Are you sure? We’d really appreciate that.
LINDA:
Either a Tuesday or Thursday is good for me. after 5.30.
MATT:
Thursday’s (Q9)
preferable – Tuesday I need to get home before 6 pm.
LINDA:
OK. Great. Let me know which train you’re catching and I’ll meet you in the
café (Q10)
outside. You can’t miss it. It’s opposite the station and next to the museum. Q10
MATT:
Brilliant. I’ll text you next week then. Thanks so much for all the advice.

RECEPTIONIST: Good afternoon, Dreamtime Travel. How can I help you?
CUSTOMER: Oh hello. I’m interested in the holidays you offer along the coast near here.
RECEPTIONIST: Yes. We operate several tours up the coast. Where in particular did you want to go?
CUSTOMER: Well, I like the sound of the holiday that mentioned whales. Was it ‘Whale Watching’?
RECEPTIONIST: Oh, that’s our
Whale Watch
Experience. It’s very popular and it’s based in a lovely little town with nice beaches.
Example
CUSTOMER: Oh right, and how long does it last?
RECEPTIONIST: It’s two days – that includes four hours’ travel time each way from here.
CUSTOMER: Good, I don’t want to be away any longer than that. So is that by coach?
RECEPTIONIST: Actually it’s
by minibus
. We like to keep those tours small and personal so we don’t take a whole coachload of people. In fact, we only take up to
fifteen people
on this tour, although we do run it with just twelve or thirteen.
Q1, Q2
CUSTOMER: Oh, right. So do you run these tours often?
RECEPTIONIST: Well it depends on the time of year. Of course, in peak times like the summer holidays, we do them every weekend, but at the moment it’s usually once a month at most.
CUSTOMER: And when is the next one going?
RECEPTIONIST: Mmm, let me see. Um, there’s one in three weeks’ time which is
April the 18th
, and then we don’t have another one until June the 2nd.
Q3
CUSTOMER: All right, and is April a good time to go?
RECEPTIONIST: Pretty good. Though the really good time is later in the year. I have to say though that the whale sighting is only one of the many things offered.
CUSTOMER: Really?
RECEPTIONIST: Yes. The hotel itself where you stay has great facilities. It’s called The Pallisades.
CUSTOMER: The Paris what?
RECEPTIONIST: No, it’s actually The Pallisades,
P-A-L-L-I-S-A-D-E-S
. It’s right on the main beach there.
Q4
CUSTOMER: Oh, I see.
RECEPTIONIST: All of the rooms have nice views and the food is really good there too.
CUSTOMER: Oh right.
CUSTOMER: And what about the other things? You know, that are included in the price.
RECEPTIONIST: Oh, there are lots of things. If you don’t want to do the whale watch cruise, your guide will take anyone who is interested either on
a bushwalk through the national park near the hotel, and there’s no extra charge for that
, or on a fishing trip. That’s an extra $12 I think. And there’s also a reptile park in town – that costs more or less the same.
Q5/Q6
CUSTOMER: No, I think I’d prefer whales to snakes.
RECEPTIONIST: Yeah. And if you just want to relax you are free to sit by the hotel pool or go down the beach. Oh, and they also have tennis courts at the hotel, but you have to pay for those by the hour. But
there are
table tennis tables downstairs and they’re part of the accommodation package.
Just speak to your guide.
Q5/Q6
CUSTOMER: Well that sounds good. So how much is the basic tour price?
RECEPTIONIST: At this time of year it’s usually around $300 but let me check. Er… oh, it’s actually
$
280
.
Q7
CUSTOMER: And the next tour, are there any places on that one?
RECEPTIONIST: How many people is it for?
CUSTOMER: There are two of us.
RECEPTIONIST: Yes, that should be fine. Can I just mention that we require all bookings to be made at least
fourteen days
before you travel to avoid cancellations of tours. And if you cancel within seven days of departure you will have to pay 50% of your total booking.
Q8
CUSTOMER: OK.
RECEPTIONIST: And you also need to pay a
20%
deposit at the time of booking.
Q9
CUSTOMER: Can I pay that by credit card?
RECEPTIONIST: Yes, you can.
CUSTOMER: All right, what I’ll do is I’ll talk to my partner and get back to you.
RECEPTIONIST: Fine. So I’ll make a provisional booking, shall I? – two for the Whale Watch Experience. Let me issue you with a customer reference number for when you call back. Do you have a pen?
CUSTOMER: Yes.
RECEPTIONIST: OK, it’s
three nine seven, four five, T
. That’s T for tango. When you call back, ask to speak to the Tour Manager, that’s me, Tracy.    Q10
CUSTOMER: Fine, I will.

原文
TUTOR:                   Hello, Sandy. How have you been getting on with your dissertation?
SANDY:                   Fine, and I’ve been working hard on the various action points we agreed on our last tutorial.
TUTOR:                   Do you want to talk me through what you’ve done?
SANDY:                   Yeah, sure. Well, we agreed on three main targets for me to aim for. The first one was to find out about suitable data analysis software.
TUTOR:                   Yes.
SANDY:                   And what I decided to do was to look through
catalogues
specialising in IT.
Q21
TUTOR:                   That’s a good idea. What did you come up with?
SANDY:                   I found the names of two promising ones.
TUTOR:                   Right.
SANDY:                   But I also thought it’d be worthwhile talking to a lecturer.
TUTOR:                   Oh right. Who did you see?
SANDY:                   Jane Prince. Do you know her? She’s in the
Computer Centre
.
Q22
TUTOR:                   Yes, of course, she’s the new Head.
SANDY:                   Yes. Well, she was very helpful.
TUTOR:                   Oh, that’s good. Did she suggest anything in particular?
SANDY：                Yeah. She recommended software called Vivat and said I should book up for a couple of practice sessions using Vivat.
TUTOR:                   Great. I’m sure you’ll find them useful.
SANDY:                   And, of course, the second target was to draw up a survey
checklist
which I…
Q23
TUTOR:                   Yes, you emailed me it last week.
SANDY:                   Have you had a chance to look…?
TUTOR:                   Of course, um I think it’s good. Very much on the right lines. I’d say your first two sections are spot on. I wouldn’t suggest that you change anything there, but in section three you really do need to have questions on
teaching experience
.
Q24
SANDY:                   Yeah. I was thinking that section looked a bit short.
TUTOR:                   Right.
SANDY:                   And my third target was, do further reading on discipline.
TUTOR:                   Oh yes. I mentioned a couple of writers, didn’t I?
SANDY:                   Yes, well I got hold of the Banerjee and I thought that was excellent. But I’m afraid I didn’t manage to get hold of the essays about
classroom
management – you know, the ones by Simon Ericsson. The bookshop said it was out of print and the library doesn’t have a copy.
Q25
TUTOR:                   Oh right, and I’m afraid I’ve lent my copy to another student. What I suggest you do is try the library again – this time apply for it through the service called special loans. Have you done that before? You’re entitled to six books a year.
SANDY:                   Yes. No problem. That’s what I’ll do.
TUTOR:                   SO, lots of useful work done.
TUTOR:                   So, let’s look at some new targets. We’ll start by having a chat about your Chapter One. I very much enjoyed reading it. Your written style is very clear and you’ve included lots of interesting descriptions of education in your target area. I’ve just got a couple of suggestions for some additional work.
SANDY:                   Of course. Could I just ask – what do you think I should call it?
TUTOR:                   Well, I’d go for something like Context
Review
. What do you think?
Q26
SANDY:                   Well, short and to the point.
TUTOR:                   Exactly. Now, as regards specific areas to work on, I’d be quite interested to have a few more statistics about the
schools
in the different zones.
Q27
SANDY:                   Oh, that wouldn’t be a problem. I can get them from the Internet.
TUTOR:                   Great, and although you did make a reference to quite a few different writers, I think you should aim to cite more works written later than
2000
.
Q28
SANDY:                   OK. That’s more difficult, but I can try. When do you want that done by?
TUTOR:                   Oh, it’s not urgent. Um I should aim for the
end of term
. But in the meantime, I think you should also be thinking about Chapter Two.
Q29
SANDY:                   Should I be drafting it already?
TUTOR:                   No, but I think you should note down its main sections.
SANDY:                   Yes. You know, I always find that the hardest part.
TUTOR:                   I always find it helpful to put some ideas on index cards.
SANDY:                   Yeah.
TUTOR:                   Um… and then you can sort them, and even lay them out on the floor. It’s a real help.
SANDY:                   Well, I’ll certainly try it! When would the deadline be for that?
TUTOR:                 My advice would be to get it done before you embark upon the
research
. You can always change it later if you need to.
Q30
SANDY:                   OK. I’ll get going on that then.

剑桥雅思6 test 2 Section 4听力原文与答案 the history of moving pictures
这篇雅思听力Section 4讲述了电影的发展史，算是Section 4的常规内容。虽然题型上采用了选择+单句填空这种不太常见的组合方式，但好在选择题并不算难，尤其是跟一般Section 4的选择题相比，简直简单的可爱。
易错点方面主要是34题和38题。34题本身没有任何难度，只要听到了肯定能选出来，但坏就坏在它离33题实在太近。很多同学都是还在思考33呢，34题就给过去了。38题则是出来的太过突然，不仅没有什么明显的提示词，而且出现了语序颠倒的情况，很容易反应不过来。

原文
Many believe that the story first began in America in 1877, when two friends were arguing over whether a horse ever had all four feet or hooves off the ground when it galloped. To settle the bet, a photographer was asked to photograph a horse galloping and the bet was settled because you could see that
all the hooves were off the ground in some of the photos
. What was even more interesting was that if the photos were shown in quick succession the horse looked like it was running – in other words ‘moving pictures’.
Q31
The person who became interested in taking the moving pictures to its next step was the famous American inventor Thomas Edison. Actually, he didn’t do the work himself but rather asked a young Scotsman in his employ to design a system, which he did. Now this young fellow was clever because the first thing he did was study other systems – primitive as they were – of moving pictures and then
put all the existing technologies together to make the first entire motion picture system
. He designed a camera, a projection device and the film. The system was first shown in New York in 1894 and was really very popular. Apparently people lined up around the block to see the wonderful new invention. There were, however, a couple of problems with the system.
The camera weighed over 200 kilograms
and only one person at a time could see the film.
Q32      Q33
Well now, news of the new system in America travelled fast and
a number of rival European systems started to appear once people had heard about it
. The single problem with all the systems was they couldn’t really project the film onto a screen – you know, so more than one person could see it.
Then in 1895, three systems were all developed, more or less at the same time and independently of each other. I guess the most famous of these was by the Lumière Brothers from France
, and they called their system the cinematographe which of course is where the word cinema comes from. There were also two brothers in Germany who developed a successful system and they called it a bioskop.
Q34    Q35
Well now, once the problem of projection had been solved, the next challenge for the inventors was to make the films longer and more interesting. A continuing problem at the time was that the
films had a tendency to break when they were being played – a problem which was caused by the tension between the two wheels, or ‘reels’ as they are called, which hold the film
.
Now this problem was solved by two American brothers. They developed the ‘Lantham Loop’, which was the simple addition of a third reel between the two main reels, and
this took all the tension away
with the result that the film stopped snapping.
Q36    Q37
So now there was a real possibility of having films of more than two or three minutes, and this led to the making of The
Great Train Robbery
– the very first movie made. It only lasted 11 minutes but was an absolute sensation, and there were cases of people watching the movie and actually fainting when the character fired a gun at the camera! Almost overnight movies became a craze, and by 1905 people in America were lining up to see movies in ‘store theatres’, as they were called then.
Q38
I guess the next big step in terms of development of technology was to have people actually talking on the film, and the first step towards this was in 1926 when
sound effects
were first used on a film. It wasn’t until the following year however that the first ‘talkie’, as they were called then, was made. This film featured actors speaking only during parts of the film and was called The Jazz Singer, and it wasn’t until 1928 that the first all-talking film was produced, and this was called The Lights of New York. Unfortunately, the sound on this early film was not very good and I believe they put subtitles on the film – that is, they printed the dialogue along the bottom of the film to compensate for this
poor sound quality
. Now, with the addition of sound, moving pictures became far more difficult to make…

DAN:          Hi Jeannie. How’s it going?
JEANNIE:       Oh, hello Dan. Pretty well, thanks. Have you managed to get the money for the course yet?
DAN:          Yes, that’s all sorted out now, thanks. It took long enough, though. It was practically a year ago that I applied to my local council for a grant, and it took them six months to turn me down.
JEANNIE:       That’s really slow.
DAN:          And I thought I was eligible for government funding, but it seems I was mistaken. So then I asked the boss of the company I used to work for if they would sponsor me, and much to my surprise,
he said they’d make a contribution (Q21)
.
JEANNIE:       But what about college grants and scholarships? There must be some you could apply for.
DAN:          Yes, there are, but they’re all so small that I decided to leave them until I was desperate.
JEANNIE:       Uhuh.
DAN:          And in fact I didn’t need to apply. My parents had been saying that as I already had a job, I ought to support myself through college.
But in the end they took pity on me, so now I’ve just about got enough (Q22)
.
JEANNIE:      That’s good.
DAN:          SO now I can put a bit of effort into meeting people – I haven’t had time so far. Any suggestions?
JEANNIE:      What about joining some college clubs?
DAN:          Oh right. You joined several didn’t you?
JEANNIE:       Yes, I’m in the drama club. It’s our first performance next week, so we’re rehearsing frantically, and I’ve got behind with my work, but it’s worth it. I’m hoping to be in the spring production, too.
DAN:          I’ve never liked acting. Are you doing anything else?
JEANNIE:       I enjoyed singing when I was at school, so I joined a group when I came to college.
I don’t think the conductor stretches us enough (Q23)
, though so I’ll give up after the next concert. And I also joined the debating society. It’s fun, but
with all the rehearsing I’m doing, something has to go (Q24)
, and I’m afraid that’s the one.
DAN:          DO you do any sports?
JEANNIE:       Yes, I’m in one of the hockey teams. I’m not very good, but I’d really miss it if I stopped. I decided to try tennis when I came to college, and I’m finding it pretty tough going. I’m simply not fit enough.
DAN:          Nor me. I think I’ll give that a miss!
JEANNIE:       I’m hoping it’ll help me to build up my stamina, but it’ll probably be a long haul.
DAN:          Good luck.
JEANNIE:       Thanks.
DAN:          How are you finding the course?
JEANNIE:       I wish we had more seminars.
DAN:          What? I’d have thought we had more than enough already. All those people saying clever things that I could never think of – it’s quite interesting, but
I wonder if I’m clever enough
(Q25)
to be doing this course.
JEANNIE:       I find it helpful to listen to the other people. I like the way we’re exploring the subject, and working towards getting insight into it.
DAN:          HOW do you get on with your tutor? I don’t think I’m on the same wavelength as mine, so I feel I’m not getting anything out of the tutorials. It would be more productive to read a book instead.
JEANNIE:       Oh, mine’s very demanding. She gives me lots of feedback and advice,
so I’ve got much better at writing essays. And she’s helping me plan my revision for the end-of-year exams (Q26)
.
DAN:          DO tell me, I always struggle with revision.
JEANNIE:       Well, the first thing is to find out exactly what’s required in the exams.
DAN:          Mm. Would it help to get hold of some past papers?
JEANNIE:       Yes. They’ll help to make it clear.
DAN:          Right, I’ll do that. Then what?
JEANNIE:       Then you can sort out your revision
priorities (Q27)
,
based on what’s most likely  to come up. I put these on a card, and read them through regularly.
DAN:          Uhuh.
JEANNIE:      But that isn’t enough in itself. You also need a
timetable (Q28)
, to see how you can fit everything in, in the time available. Then keep it in front of you while you’re studying.
DAN:          I’ve done that before, but it hasn’t helped me!
JEANNIE:       Maybe you need to do something different every day, so if you “break down your revision into
small tasks (Q29)
, and allocate them to specific days, there’s more incentive to tackle them. With big topics you’re more likely to put off starting.
DAN:          Good idea.
JEANNIE:       And as I revise each topic I write a
single paragraph (Q30)
about it- then later I can read it through quickly, and it helps fix things in my mind.
DAN:          That’s brilliant.
JEANNIE:       I also write answers to questions for the exam practice. It’s hard to make myself do it, though!
DAN:          Well, I’ll try. Thanks a lot, Jeannie. That’s a great help.
JEANNIE:       NO problem.
DAN:          See you around.
JEANNIE:       Bye.

原文
Today we continue our series on ecology and conservation with a look at a particularly endangered member of the black bear family.
One in ten black bears is actually born with a white coat, which is the result of a special
gene (Q1)
that surfaces in a few.
Local people have named it ‘the spirit bear’.
And according to the legends of these communities, its snowy
fur
brings with it a special
power (Q2)
.
Because of this, it has always been highly regarded by them—so much that they do not speak of seeing it to anyone else.
It is their way of protecting it when
strangers (Q3)
visit the area.
The white bear’s habitat is quite interesting.
The bear’s strong relationship with the old-growth rainforest is a complex one.
The while bear relies on the huge centuries-old trees in the forest in many ways.
For example, the old-growth trees have extremely long roots that help prevent
erosion
(Q4)
of the soil along the banks of the many fish streams.
Keeping these banks
intact
is important because these streams are home to
salmon
, which are the bear’s main food source.
In return, the bear s feeding habits
nurture
the forest.
As the bears eat the
salmon
, they
discard
the skin and bones in great amounts on the forest floor, which provide vital nutrients.
These produce
lush
vegetation
that sustains thousands of other types of life forms, from birds to insects and more.
Today, the spirit bear lives off the coast of the province of British Columbia on a few
islands (Q5)
.
There is great concern for their survival since it is estimated that less than two hundred of these white bears remain.
The best way to protect them is to make every effort to
preserve
the delicate balance of their forest environment—in other words, their
ecosystem
.
The greatest threat to the bear’s existence is the loss of its habitat.
Over many years, logging companies have stripped the land by cutting down a large number of trees.
In addition, they have built
roads (Q6)
which have fractured the areas where the bear usually feeds, and many
hibernation
sites have also been lost.
The logging of the trees along the streams has damaged the places where the bears fish.
To make matters worse, the number of
salmon
in those streams is declining because there is no legal limit on
fishing (Q7)
at the moment.
All these influences have a negative impact on the spirit bear’s very existence, which is made all the more
fragile
by the fact that
reproduction
(Q8)
among these bears has always been disappointingly low.
And so, what’s the situation going forward?
Community organizations, environmental groups and the British Columbia government are now working together on the problem.
The government is now requiring logging companies to adopt a better logging
method (Q9)
, which is a positive step.
However, these measures alone may not be
sufficient
to ensure a healthy population of the spirit bear in the future.
Other steps also need to be taken.
While it is important to maintain the spirit bear’s habitat, there also needs to be more emphasis on its
expansion (Q10)
.
The move is justified as it will also create space for other bears that are losing their homes.

JANE:
Hello, Jane Fairbanks speaking.
FRANK:
Oh, good morning. My name’s Frank Pritchard. I’ve just retired and moved to Southoe. I’d like to become a volunteer, and I gather you co-ordinate voluntary work in the village.
JANE:
That’s right.
FRANK:
What sort of thing could I do?
JANE:
Well, we need help with the village library. We borrow books from the town library, and individuals also donate them. So, one thing you could do is get involved in
collecting (Q1)
them – if you’ve got a car, that is.
FRANK:
Yes, that’s no problem.
JANE:
The times are pretty flexible so we can arrange it to suit you. Another thing is the
records (Q2)
that we keep of the books we’re given, and those we borrow and need to return to the town library. It would be very useful to have another person to help keep them up to date.
FRANK:
Right. I’m used to working on a computer – I presume they’re computerised?
JANE:
Oh yes.
FRANK:
Is the library purpose-built? I haven’t noticed it when I’ve walked round the village.
JANE:
No, we simply have the use of a room in the village hall, the
West (Q3)
Room. It’s on the left as you go in.
FRANK:
I must go and have a look inside the hall.
JANE:
Yes, it’s a nice building.
FRANK:
Do you run a lunch club in the village for elderly people? I know a lot of places do.
JANE:
Yes, we have a very successful club.
FRANK:
I could help with
transport (Q4)
, if that’s of any use.
JANE:
Ooo definitely. People come to the club from neighbouring villages, and we’re always in need of more drivers.
FRANK:
And does the club have groups that focus on a particular hobby, too? I could get involved in one or two, particularly if there are any
art (Q5)
groups.
JANE:
Excellent. I’ll find out where we need help and get back to you.
FRANK:
Fine. What about help for individual residents. Do you arrange that at all?
JANE:
Yes, we do it as a one-off. In fact, there’s Mrs Carroll. She needs a lift to the
hospital (Q6)
next week, and we’re struggling to find someone.
FRANK:
When’s her appointment?
JANE:
On Tuesday. It would take the whole morning.
FRANK:
I could do that.
JANE:
Oh, that would be great. Thank you. And also, next week, we’re arranging to have some work done to Mr Selsbury’s house before he moves, as he isn’t healthy enough to do it himself. We’ve got some people to decorate his kitchen, but if you could do some weeding in his
garden (Q7)
, that would be wonderful.
FRANK:
OK. I’d enjoy that. And presumably the day and time are flexible.
JANE:
Oh yes. Just say when would suit you best, and we’ll let Mr Selsbury know.
FRANK:
Good.
JANE:
The volunteers group also organises monthly social events, which is a great way to meet other people, of course.
FRANK:
Uhuh.
JANE:
So next month, on the 19th of October, we’re holding a
quiz (Q8)
– a couple of residents are great at planning unusual ones, and we always fill the village hall.
FRANK:
That sounds like fun. Can I do anything to help?
JANE:
Well, because of the number of people, we need plenty of refreshments for halfway through. So, if you could provide any, we’d be grateful.
FRANK:
I’m sure I could. I’ll think about what to make, and let you know.
JANE:
Thank you. Then on November the 18th, we’re holding a dance, also in the village hall. We’ve booked a band that specialises in music of the 1930s – they’ve been before, and we’ve had a lot of requests to bring them back.
FRANK:
I’m not really a dancer, but I’d like to do something to help.
JANE:
Well, we sell
tickets (Q9)
in advance, and having an extra person to check them at the door, as people arrive, would be good – it can be quite a bottleneck if everyone arrives at once!
FRANK:
OK, I’m happy with that.
JANE:
We’re also arranging a New Year’s Eve party. We’re expecting that to be a really big event, so instead of the village hall, it’ll be held in the Mountfort Hotel.
FRANK:
The …?
JANE:
Mountfort. M-O-U-N-T-F-O-R-T Hotel. It isn’t in Southoe itself, but it’s only a couple of miles away. The hotel will be providing dinner and we’ve booked a band. The one thing we haven’t got yet is a
poster (Q10)
. That isn’t something you could do, by any chance, is it?
FRANK:
Well actually, yes. Before I retired I was a graphic designer, so that’s right up my street.
JANE:
Oh perfect! I’ll give you the details, and then perhaps you could send me a draft …
FRANK:
Of course.

SHIRLEY:
Hello?
TOM:
Oh hello. I was hoping to speak to Jack Fitzgerald about renting a cottage.
SHIRLEY:
I’m his wife, Shirley, and we own the cottages together, so I’m sure I can help you.
TOM:
Great. My name’s Tom. Some friends of ours rented Granary Cottage from you last year, and they thought it was great. So my wife and I are hoping to come in May for a week.
SHIRLEY:
What date did you have in mind?
TOM:
The week beginning the 14th, if possible.
SHIRLEY:
I’ll just check… I’m sorry, Tom, it’s already booked that week. It’s free the week beginning the
28th (Q1)
, though, for seven nights. In fact, that’s the only time you could have it in May.
TOM:
Oh. Well, we could manage that, I think. We’d just need to change a couple of things. How much would it cost?
SHIRLEY:
That’s the beginning of high season, so it’d be £
550 (Q2)
for the week.
TOM:
Ah. That’s a bit more than we wanted to pay, I’m afraid. We’ve budgeted up to £500 for accommodation.
SHIRLEY:
Well, we’ve just finished converting another building into a cottage, which we’re calling
Chervil (Q3)
Cottage.
TOM:
Sorry? What was that gain?
SHIRLEY:
Chervil. C-H-E-R-V for Victor I-L.
TOM:
Oh, that’s a herb, isn’t it?
SHIRLEY:
That’s right. It grows fairly wild around here. You could have that for the week you want for £480.
TOM:
OK.So could you tell me something about it, please?
SHIRLEY:
Of course. The building was built as a
garage (Q4)
. It’s a little smaller than Granary Cottage.
TOM:
So that must sleep two people, as well?
SHIRLEY:
That’s right. There’s a double bedroom.
TOM:
Does it have a
garden (Q5)
?
SHIRLEY:
Yes, you get to it from the living room through French doors, and we provide two deckchairs. We hope to build a patio in the near future, but I wouldn’t like to guarantee it’ll be finished by May.
TOM:
OK.
SHIRLEY:
The front door opens onto the old farmyard, and
parking (Q6)
isn’t a problem – there’s plenty of room at the front for that. There are some trees and potted plants there.
TOM:
What about facilities in the cottage? It has standard things like a cooker and fridge, I presume.
SHIRLEY:
In the kitchen area there’s a fridge-freezer and we’ve just put in an electric cooker.
TOM:
Is there a washing machine?
SHIRLEY:
Yes. There’s also a TV in the living room, which plays DVDs too. The bathroom is too small for a bath, so there’s a shower instead. I think a lot of people prefer that nowadays, anyway.
TOM:
It’s more environmentally friendly, isn’t it? Unless you spend half the day in it!
SHIRLEY:
Exactly.
TOM:
What about heating? It sometimes gets quite cool at that time of year.
SHIRLEY:
There’s central heating, and if you want to light a fire, there’s a stove. We can provide all the
wood (Q7)
you need for it. It smells so much nicer than coal, and it makes the room very cosy – we’ve got one in our own house.
TOM:
That sounds very pleasant. Perhaps we should come in the winter, to make the most of it!
SHIRLEY:
Yes, we find we don’t want to go out when we’ve got the fire burning. There are some attractive views from the cottage, which I haven’t mentioned. There’s a famous stone
bridge (Q8)
– it’s one of the oldest in the region, and you can see it from the living room. It isn’t far away. The bedroom window looks in the opposite direction, and has a lovely view of the hills and the
monument (Q9)
at the top.
TOM:
Well, that all sounds perfect. I’d like to book it, please. Would you want a deposit?
SHIRLEY:
Yes, we ask for thirty percent to secure your booking, so that’ll be, um, £144.
TOM:
And when would you like the rest of the money?
SHIRLEY:
You’re coming in May, so the last day of
March (Q10)
, please.
TOM:
Fine.
SHIRLEY:
Excellent. Could I just take your details …

MAN:              Yes please. Could you tell me what kind of staff you are looking for?
WOMAN:       We’re looking for
waiters (Q1)
at the moment. There was one post for a cook,   but that’s already been taken.
MAN:              Oh right. Erm, what are the hours of work?
WOMAN:       There are two different shifts – there’s a day shift from 7 to 2 and a late shift from 4 till 11.
MAN:              And can people choose which one they want to do?
WOMAN:       Not normally, because everyone would choose the day shift I suppose. You alternate from one week to another.

if you want to, and     there’s no charge for it so you might as well.
MAN:              Oh good. Yes, so let’s see. I’d get er, two hundred and twenty one, no, two hundred and thirty one pounds a week?
WOMAN:       You’d also get tips – our guests tend to be quite generous.
MAN:              Erm, is there a uniform? What about clothes?
WOMAN:       Yes, I forgot to mention that. You need to wear a white shirt, just a plain one, and
dark (Q5)
trousers. You know, not green or anything like that. And we don’t supply those.
MAN:              That’s okay, I’ve got trousers, I’d just have to buy a couple of shirts. What about anything else? Do I need a waistcoat or anything?
WOMAN:       YOU have to wear a
jacket
(Q6)

MAN:              I see. Er, one last thing – I don’t know what the starting date is.
WOMAN:       Just a minute, I think it’s some time
around the end of June. Yes, the 28th,
(Q7)
in time for the summer.
MAN:             That’s great. I’m available from the 10th.
WOMAN:       Oh good. Well, if you can call again you need to speak to the Service Manager. Her name’s Jane Urwin, that’s
U-R-W-I-N (Q8)
, and she’ll probably arrange to meet you.
MAN:              Okay. And when’s the best time to ring?
WOMAN:        Could you call tomorrow? Urn, she usually starts checking the rooms at
midday
(Q9)
,
so before then if you can

reference (Q10)
, so you might like to be   thinking about that. You know, just someone who knows you and can vouch for you.

My name’s Dan Pearman and I’d like to talk about the work of Pedal Power, a small charity based mainly in the UK. I’ll be giving our contact details at the end, if anyone would like to find out more about how to support us.
But first, how the charity began. I got the idea of exporting bicycles to developing countries while I was in Ecuador. I went there in 1993 just after graduating from university. After three years of studying, I wanted adventure. I loved travelling, so
I decided to join a voluntary organisation
and was sent to Ecuador to carry out land surveys. The project came to an end after five years and when I returned to the UK in 1998, I started planning Pedal Power.
Q11
Where I lived in Ecuador was a very rural area. My neighbour had the only bicycle in the village, whereas everyone else walked everywhere. My neighbour’s business was unusually successful, and for years I couldn’t understand why. Then I realised
having a bike meant he could get where he wanted to go without much trouble
. Other local carpenters could only accept jobs in a three-kilometre radius, so no matter how skilled they were, they could never do as many jobs as my neighbour.
Q12
At Pedal Power, we collect second-hand bikes in the UK and send them to some of the poorest regions in the world. When we distribute bikes overseas we don’t give them away for free. We’d like to, but long term that doesn’t really help the local economy. The demand for bikes is enormous, which makes them very expensive locally. So we sell them for 5% of the normal price.
But in order to continue operating we need to have a constant supply of bikes which we send out every six months.
Q13
One example of a town that’s received bicycles from Pedal Power is Rivas. It was the first place I sent a full container of bicycles to. Most people there now own a bicycle.
The local economy has developed so much, you wouldn’t recognise it as the same place
. In fact, there are more bikes than on the streets of Amsterdam, if you’ve ever been there.
Q14
But Pedal Power still needs your help. You may have read about some of our recent problems in the British media. In August 2000, we simply ran out of money. We had containers of bikes ready to send, but
no money to pay the bills
. It was a terrible situation. We managed to ensure the bikes went out on time, but the other problems carried on for several months.
Q15
Fortunately in October 2001 we won an Enterprise Award which helped us enormously. We invested fifteen of the
seventy-five-thousand-pound
prize money to help secure our future. Winning the award helped raise our profile, and the money enabled us to pay all our shipping costs, which represent our greatest expense. Pedal Power changes lives – when someone gets a bicycle from us, they see a 14% increase in their income. We’re currently looking to invest in
computers
so that our office staff can do an even better job. Because of our work, people in a number of countries now have a better standard of living – so far we’ve provided 46,000 people with bikes. But we’d like to send more, at least 50,000 by the end of the year.
Q16, Q17
Now there are many ways in which you can support the work of Pedal Power, not just by taking a bike to a collection in your area. I should also like to say if you do have a bike to donate, it doesn’t matter what condition it’s in – if we can’t repair it, we’ll strip it down for spare parts. Of course, to do that
we always need tools
, which are expensive to buy, so we welcome any that you can give. Also, you could help by contacting the voluntary staff at our offices, they’ll be able to suggest
activities you could organise to bring in funds for us
. People do all kinds of things – including, of course, sponsored bike rides. Also,
we’re always interested to hear of other places that would benefit from receiving a consignment of bikes
, and welcome suggestions from people who’ve been to developing regions on their travels. We hope that by talking on radio programmes like this, we will be able to raise public awareness, which will lead to government organisations also giving us regular financial support, something that we really need.
Q18/19/20
If you’d like some more information about where to donate an old bicycle or offer help in other ways please contact us on …

雅思听力
原文
Good morning. In the last few lectures I’ve been talking about the history of domestic building construction. But today I want to begin looking at some contemporary, experimental designs for housing. So, I’m going to start with a house which is constructed more or less under the ground. And one of the interesting things about this project is that the owners – both professionals but not architects – wanted to be closely involved, so they decided to manage the project themselves.
Their chief aim was to create somewhere that was as environmentally-friendly as possible (Q31)
. But at the same time they wanted to live somewhere peaceful – they’d both grown up in a rural area and disliked urban life.
So the first thing they did was to look for a site. And they found a disused stone quarry in a beautiful area.
The price was relatively low (Q32)
, and they liked the idea of recycling the land, as it were. As it was, the quarry was an ugly blot on the landscape, and it wasn’t productive any longer, either.
They consulted various architects and looked at a number of designs before finally deciding on one. As I’ve said, it was a design for a sort of underground house, and it was built into the earth itself, with two storeys. The north, east and west sides were set in the earth, and only the sloping, south-facing side was exposed to light. That was made of a double layer of very strong
glass (Q33)
. There were also photovoltaic tiles fixed to the top and bottom of this sloping wall. These are tiles that are designed to store energy from the sun. And the walls had a layer of foam around them too, to increase the
insulation (Q34)
.
Now, what is of interest to us about this project is the features which make the building energy-efficient. Sunlight floods in through the glass wall, and to maximise it there are lots of mirrors and
windows (Q35)
inside the house. That helps to spread the light around. So that’s the first thing – light is utilised as fully as possible.
In addition, the special tiles on the outside convert energy from the sun and generate some of the house’s electricity. In fact,  and it’s possible that in future the house may even generate an
electricity (Q36)
surplus, and that the owners will be able to sell some to the national grid.
As well as that, wherever possible, recycled materials have been used. For example, the floors
(Q37)
are made of reclaimed wood. And the owners haven’t bought a single item of new furniture – they just kept what they already had. And then there’s the system for dealing with the
waste (Q38)
produced in the house. This is dealt with organically – it’s purified by being filtered through reed beds which have been planted for that purpose in the garden. So the occupants of the house won’t pollute the land or use any damaging chemicals.
It’s true that the actual construction of the house was harmful to the environment mainly because they had to use massive amounts of
concrete (Q39)
– one of the biggest sources of carbon dioxide in manufacturing. And, as you know, this is very damaging to the environment. In total, the house construction has released 70 tons of carbon dioxide into the air. Now that’s a frightening thought. However, once the initial ‘debt’ has been cleared – and it’s been calculated that this will only take
fifteen years (Q40)
– this underground house won’tcost anything – environmentally I mean – because unlike ordinary houses, it is run in a way that is completely environmentally friendly.
So, eco-housing like this is likely to become much more …

test2 Section2
雅思听力
原文
Good morning.
I’m very pleased to have this opportunity to say a little about two exciting new developments in the city: the Brackenside Open-Air Swimming Pool and the children’s Adventure Playground in Central Park.
As many of you may know,
the idea for these initiatives came from you, the public(Q11)
, in the
extensive
consultation exercise which the City Council conducted last year.
And they have been realised using money from the SWRDC—the South West Regional Development Commission.
First of all, Brackenside Pool.
As many of the older members of the audience will remember, there used to be a wonderful open-air pool on the sea front 30 years ago but it had to close when it was judged to be unsafe.
For the design of this new heated pool, we were very happy to secure the talents of internationally
renowned
architect Ellen Wendon, who has managed to combine a charming 1930s design, which fits in so well with many of the other buildings in the area, with up-to-the-minute features such as a recycling system -the only one of its kind in the—
which enables seawater to be used in the pool(Q12)
.
Now,
there has been quite a bit of discussion in the local press about whether there would be enough room for the number of visitors we’re hoping to attract(Q13)
, but the design is
deceptive
and there have been rigorous checks about
capacity
.
Also, just in case you were wondering, we’re on schedule for a June 15th opening date and well within budget: a
testimony
to the excellent work of local contractors Hickman’s.
We hope that as many people as possible will be there on June 15th.
We have engaged award-winning actress Coral White to declare the pool open and there’ll be drinks and snacks available at the pool side.
There’ll also be a competition for the public to decide on the
sculpture
we plan to have at the entrance(Q14)
: you will decide which famous historical figure from the city we should have.
And now, moving on to the Central Park Playground, which we’re pleased to announce has just won the
Douglas
Award for safety: the news came through only last week.
The unique design is based on the
concept
of the Global Village, with the playground being divided into six areas showing different parts of the world—each with a
representative
feature.
For example, there is a section on Asia, and
this is represented by rides and equipment in the shape of snakes, orangutans, tigers and so on(Q15)
—
fauna
native to the forests of the region.
Moving south to the Antarctic—we couldn’t run to an ice rink I’m afraid but opted instead for
climbing blocks in the shape of mountains(Q16)
—I thought they could have had slides for the glaciers but the designers did want to avoid being too literal!
Then on to South America—and here the theme is El Dorado—
games replicating the search for mines full of precious Stone(Q17)
.
And then moving up to North America, here there was a
considerable
debate—I know the contribution of cinema and jazz was considered but the designers finally opted for
rockets and the International Space Station(Q18)
.
Eastwards to Europe then, and perhaps the most traditional choice of all the areas:
medieval
castles and other fortifications(Q19)
.
Then last, but not least, moving south to Africa and a whole set of wonderful mosaics and trails to represent the
great rivers(Q20)
of this
fascinating
and varied continent.
Now, the opening date for our Global Playground is 10th July.
And again we’d love to see you there—so make a date and come and see this magnificent, original new
amenity
right in the heart of the city.

LIBRARIAN: Good morning, North College Library. How can I help you?
MAN: I was wondering if it was possible to join the library.
LIBRARIAN: Are you a student at North College?
MAN: No, I’m not, but someone told me it was possible to join, even if I wasn’t.
LIBRARIAN: That’s right, it is. Are you over
18
? That’s our minimum joining age.
Example
MAN: Yes, I am.
LIBRARIAN: That’s no problem then.
MAN: Could you tell me what I have to do to join?
LIBRARIAN: Well, you’ll need to come into the library and fill out some forms. You’ll also need to bring two
passport photos
with you. We also need two documents for ID, so a driving license would be fine.
Q1
MAN: I’ve got that and what else? A credit card?
LIBRARIAN: No, it needs to have your address on it.
MAN: Shall I bring
a bank statement
, would that do?
Q2
LIBRARIAN: That’ll be fine.
MAN: Good. Does it cost anything to join?
LIBRARIAN: Well, it’s free for students here but otherwise it’s
￡125
per year or ￡25 if you’ve got a current student card from another college.
Q3
MAN: I was at Westerley College until last year but now I’ve got a job at Jefferson’s steel factory. Er, it’s more expensive than I thought. My local library is free.
LIBRARIAN: But you’ll find they don’t have the range of reference books or facilities which we buy for our students. That’s why you have to pay to be an external member.
MAN: I see. How many books can I borrow?
LIBRARIAN: We allow twelve items borrowed at any one time if you’re a student, and that includes CDs, DVDs and videos. However, it’s only
eight
items for members of the public.
Q4
MAN: Fine. And how long can I have them for?
LIBRARIAN: Well, you can have both fiction and reference books for four weeks which isn’t bad really.
MAN: And what happens if I return them late?
LIBRARIAN: Like all libraries there’s a fine system in place. The minimum fine is
￡1.50
but it can be much higher for some items – up to ￡5 per week. We’ll give you a booklet with all the details when you join. You can always renew items if they’re not required by anyone else by telephoning or logging on to our website.
Q5
MAN: What about the computers? Can I use them free of charge?
LIBRARIAN: For college students it’s free, but for external members like yourself, the first hour is free and then we make a nominal charge of ￡1 per hour thereafter.
MAN: Do I have to book in advance for them?
LIBRARIAN: Oh, yes, it’s advisable. Most people tend to book twenty-four hours in advance although sometimes you can get one with only six hours’ notice. However, the earliest you can book a computer is
forty-eight
hours before you need it, and you can only book one hour at a time. If no-one else has booked the computer out, then you may be able to have another hour if you want. We have a wide range of databases, so the computers are in great demand.
Q6
MAN: I’m thinking of doing some writing and I might need to access national newspapers. Do you have them on these databases?
LIBRARIAN: We do indeed. We’ve got all the big nationals, The Guardian and The Observer, The Independent and The Times and Sunday Times. We’ve also got all the
local papers
and a wide selection of magazines.
Q7
MAN: Excellent. I assume you have photocopying facilities?
LIBRARIAN: Of course. 5p a sheet for both A4 and A3 black-and-white copies and 40p a sheet for colour. You can get
a card
from the counter here – it doesn’t take coins.
Q8
MAN: OK. Oh by the way, another thing I was wondering about was if you ran any writing classes through the library?
LIBRARIAN: We do, but you’ll have to speak to John Grantingham about that. He’s our resident author. He runs the creative writing classes.
MAN: John… Grant…. Could you spell that for me please?
LIBRARIAN: Certainly.
G – R – A – N – T – I – N – G – H – A – M
.
Q9
MAN: Are the classes here at the library?
MAN: Yes – he’s here on Thursday evenings, oh no sorry,
Friday
– he’s just changed it. You can contact him by emailing the library.
LIBRARIAN: Okay. Right, well that’s about all I need to know. Thank you. I’ll be along later this week to join. Thanks. Bye.

剑桥雅思10
test3 Section4
雅思听力
原文
Today, I want to talk about self-regulatory focus theory and how the actions of leaders can affect the way followers approach different situations.
Self-regulatory focus theory is a theory developed by Tori Higgins.
He says that a person’s focus at any given time is to either approach pleasure or avoid pain.
These are two basic motivations that each and every one of us has, and they cause us to have different kinds of goals.
Promotion goals in different life situations emphasise
achievement (Q31)
.
Prevention goals are oriented towards the avoidance of punishment.
In a specific situation, our thoughts might focus more on promotion goals or more on prevention goals.
The theory suggests that two factors affect which goals we are focusing on.
First, there is a
chronic
factor.
This factor is connected to a person’s
personality (Q32)
and says that each person has a basic tendency to either focus more on promotion goals or focus more on prevention goals as part of his or her personality.
Second, there is a
situational (Q33)
factor which means that the context we are in can make us more likely to focus on one set of goals or the other.
For example, we are more likely to be thinking about pleasure and to have promotion goals when we are spending time with a
friend
(Q34)
.
In contrast, if we are working on an important project for our boss, we are more likely to try to avoid making mistakes and therefore have more prevention goals in our mind.
Research has shown that the goals we are focusing on at a given time affect the way we think.
For example, when focusing on promotion goals, people consider their ideal self, their
aspirations (Q35)
and gains.
They don’t think about what they can lose, so they think in a happier mode.
They feel more inspired to change.
When people are focusing on prevention goals, they think about their “ought” self.
What are they supposed to be?
What are people expecting from them?
They consider their obligations to others.
As a result, they experience more anxiety and try to avoid situations where they could lose.
Now that I have talked about the two focuses and how they affect people, I want to look at the idea that the way leaders behave, or their
style (Q36)
of leading, can affect the focus that followers adopt in a specific situation.
In talking about leadership, we often mention transformational leaders and transactional leaders.
Transformational leaders, when interacting with their followers, focus on their
development (Q37)
.
In their words and actions transformational leaders highlight change.
Their speech is passionate and conveys a
definitive
vision (Q38)
.
All of these things can encourage followers to think about what could be.
In other words, they inspire a promotion focus in their followers.
In contrast, transactional leaders focus on developing clear
structures (Q39)
that tell their followers exactly what is expected of them.
While they do explain the rewards people will get for following orders, they emphasise more how a follower will be punished or that a follower won’t get rewarded if his or her behaviour doesn’t change.
In short, they emphasise the consequences of making a mistake.
This emphasis will clearly lead followers to focus on avoiding punishment and problems.
This is clearly a prevention focus.
In conclusion, it is important to understand that one focus is not necessarily better than the other one.
For a designer who works in a field where a lot of
innovation
(Q40)
is needed, a promotion focus is probably better.
In contrast, a prevention focus which causes people to work more cautiously and produce higher quality work might be very appropriate for a job like a surgeon, for example.
The main point of the research, though, is that the actions of leaders can greatly influence whether people approach a situation with more of a promotion focus or more of a prevention focus.

雅思听力
原文
TUTOR: Right, Sandra. You wanted to see me to get some feedback on your group’s proposal. The one you’re submitting for the Geography Society field trip competition. I’ve had a look through your proposal and I think it’s a really good choice. In fact, I only have a few things to say about it, but even in an outline document like this you really have to be careful to avoid typos and problems with layout in the proposal, and even in the contents page. So read it through carefully before submitting it, okay?
SANDRA: Will do.
TUTOR: And I’ve made a few notes on the proposal about things which
could have been better sequenced
(
Q21
)
.
SANDRA: Okay.
TUTOR: AS for the writing itself, I’ve annotated the proposal as and where I thought it could be improved. Generally speaking, I feel you’ve often used complex structures and long sentences for the sake of it and as a consequence. . . although your paragraphing and inclusion of subheadings help. . . it’s quite hard to follow your train of thought at times.
So cut them down a bit, can you?
(
Q22
)
SANDRA: Really?
TUTOR: Yes. And don’t forget simple formatting like numbering.
SANDRA: Didn’t I use page numbers?
TUTOR: I didn’t mean that. Look, you’ve remembered to include headers and footers, which is good, but
listing ideas clearly is important
(
Q23
)
. Number them or use bullet points, which is even clearer. Then you’ll focus the reader on your main points. I thought your suggestion to go to the Navajo Tribal Park was a very good idea.
SANDRA: I’ve always wanted to go there.
My father was a great fan of cowboy films and the Wild West so I was subjected to seeing all the epics, many of which were shot there
(
Q24
)
. As a consequence, it feels very familiar to me and it’s awesome both geographically and visually, so it’s somewhere I’ve always wanted to visit. The subsequent research I did and the online photographs made me even keener.
TUTOR: Interesting. Right, let’s look at the content of your proposal now.
SANDRA: Did you find it comprehensive enough?
TUTOR: Well, yes and no. You’ve listed several different topics on your contents page, but I’m not sure they’re all relevant.
SANDRA: NO? Well, I thought that from the perspective of a field trip, one thing I needed
to focus on was the sandstone plateaux and cliffs themselves
. (
Q25
) The way they tower up from the flat landscape is just amazing. The fact that the surrounding softer rocks were eroded by wind and rain, leaving these huge outcrops high above the plain. It’s hardly surprising that tourists flock to see the area.
TUTOR: Well, yes, I’d agree with including those points. . .
SANDRA: And then the fact that it’s been home to native American Navajos and all the social history that goes with that. The hardships they endured trying to save their territory from the invading settlers. Their culture is so rich – all those wonderful stories.
TUTOR: Well, I agree it’s interesting, but it’s not immediately relevant to your proposal, Sandra, so at this stage, I suggest you focus on other considerations.
I think an indication of what the students on the trip could actually do when they get there should be far more central
(
Q26
), so that certainly needs to be included and to be expanded upon.
And I’d like to see something about the local wildlife, and vegetation too
(
Q27
), not that I imagine there’s much to see. Presumably the tourist invasion hasn’t helped.
SANDRA: Okay, I’ll do some work on those two areas as well. But you’re right, there’s not much apart from some very shallow-rooted species. Although it’s cold and snowy there in the winter, the earth is baked so hard in the summer sun that rainwater can’t penetrate. So it’s a case of flood or drought, really.
TUTOR: So, I understand. Now, before we look at everything in more detail, I’ve got a few factual questions for you. It would be a good idea to include the answers in your finished proposal, because they’re missing from your draft.
SANDRA: Fine.
TUTOR: So, you mentioned the monoliths and the spires, which was good, but what area does the tribal park cover? Do you know?
SANDRA:
12, 000
(
Q28
) hectares, and the plain is at about 5, 850 metres above sea level.
TUTOR: Larger than I expected. Okay. Where’s the nearest accommodation? That’s a practical detail that you haven’t included. Have you done any research on that?
SANDRA: Yes. There’s nowhere to stay in the park itself, but there’s an old trading post called Goulding quite near. All kinds of tours start from Goulding, too.
TUTOR: What kind of tours?
SANDRA: Well, the most popular are in four-wheel drive jeeps – but I wouldn’t recommend hiring those. I think the best way to appreciate the area would be to hire
horses
(
Q29
) instead and trek around on those. Biking is not allowed and it’s impossible to drive around the area in private vehicles. The tracks are too rough.
TUTOR: Okay, lastly, what else is worth visiting there?
SANDRA: There are several
caves
(
Q30
), but I haven’t looked into any details. I’ll find out about them.
TUTOR: Okay, good. Now what I’d like to know is. . .

剑桥雅思7Test3听力Section4答案解析 Hotels and the tourist industry
剑7 test 3 Section 4
雅思听力
原文
Good morning everyone. Today’s lecture forms part of the Hospitality and Tourism module. Last week I looked at the economy end of the hotel business; this week I’m going to discuss the luxury end of the market. Let’s consider the following scenario…
You wake up in the middle of the night in a strange hotel miles away from home, disoriented most probably from jet lag, when even the most expensive surroundings
can seem empty and dispiriting
. You have paid a great deal of money to stay in this first-class hotel with its contemporary technology, but according to recent research carried out by an international travel and public relations company, all is not well. The research suggests that even the most opulent, luxurious hotels seem to have underestimated the most basic needs of their customers – be they travelling for work or pleasure:
the need to feel at home in surroundings which are both familiar and inviting
.
Q31 Q32
Do these findings, however, apply only to hotels situated in particular areas? Is it possible that the external environment can affect a guest’s well-being? The company’s research covered a
whole range of different hotel types
, both independent hotels and those which are part of large chains. They investigated chic so-called boutique hotels in the heart of downtown business districts, stately mansions located in the depths of beautiful countryside, and plush hotels built at the edge of tropical beaches surrounded by palm trees and idyllic blue ocean. . And the research concluded that
what was outside the hotel building simply didn’t matter
. This is a fascinating revelation and those of you hoping to move into careers in the travel and leisure industry would be well advised to look at the findings in more detail.
Q33 Q34
But back to the main point of this lecture… the need to feel at home. What can the hotel industry do about it? And is the very idea so subjective that it’s impossible to do anything about it on a global basis?
However, nothing stands still in this world. One company has come up with the slogan ‘Take Your Home With You’, and aims to provide clients with luxury serviced apartments. Those in the business travel industry maintain that these serviced apartments dispense with all the unwanted and expensive hotel services
that business travellers don’t want
,
while maximising the facilities they do want. For example, not only sleeping and living accommodation, but also
a sleek modern kitchen
that allows guests to cook and entertain if they wish, at no additional cost. The attractions of such facilities are obvious and it’ll be interesting to see whether the company manages
to establish a trend all over the world
and make a lasting impact on the luxury accommodation market.
Q35 Q36 Q37
Now, finally I want to consider the psychology underpinning the traditional holiday hotel industry. As a hotelier, how do you go about attracting people to give up the security of their own home and entrust themselves to staying in a completely strange place and sleeping in an unfamiliar bed? Firstly, hotels exploit people’s
need to escape
the predictability of their everyday lives. For a few days people can pretend they are free of responsibilities and can indulge themselves. Secondly, there is something very powerful in our need to be pampered and looked after,
it’s almost as if we return to being a baby
, when everything was done for us and we felt safe and secure. And not far removed from this is the pleasure in being spoilt and given little treats – like the miniscule bottles of shampoo and tiny bars of soap,
the chocolate
on your pillow at night – and we actually forget that we are paying for it all!
Q38 Q39 Q40
Next week, I’m going to look at eco-hotels, a fairly new phenomenon but increasingly popular…

Good morning. My name’s Erica Matthews, and I’m the owner of Matthews Island Holidays, a company set up by my parents. Thank you for coming to this presentation, in which I hope to interest you in what we have to offer. We’re a small, family-run company, and we believe in the importance of the personal touch, so we don’t aim to compete with other companies on the number of customers. What we do is build on our
many years’ experience – more than almost any other rail holiday company (Q11)
– to ensure we provide perfect holidays in a small number of destinations, which we’ve got to know extremely well.
I’ll start with our six-day Isle of Man holiday. This is a fascinating island in the Irish Sea, with Wales to the south, England to the east, Scotland to the north and Northern Ireland to the west. Our holiday starts in
Heysham, where your tour manager will meet you (Q12)
, then you’ll travel by ferry to the Isle of Man. Some people prefer to fly from Luton instead, and another popular option is to go by train to Liverpool and take a ferry from there.
You have five nights in the hotel, and the price covers five breakfasts and dinners, and
lunch on the three days when there are organised trips (Q13)
: day four is free, and most people have lunch in a café or restaurant in Douglas.
The price of the holiday includes the ferry to the Isle of Man, all travel on the island, the hotel, and the meals I’ve mentioned. Incidentally, we try to make booking our holidays as simple and fair as possible, so unlike with many companies, the price is the same whether you book six months in advance or at the last minute, and there’s no supplement for single rooms in hotels.
If you make a booking then need to change the start date, for example because of illness, you’re welcome to change to an alternative date or a different tour, for a small administrative fee (Q14)
.
OK, so what does the holiday consist of? Well, on day one you’ll arrive in time for a short introduction by your tour manager, followed by dinner in the hotel. The dining room looks out at the
river (Q15)
, close to where it flows into the harbour, and there’s usually plenty of activity going on.
On day two you’ll take the coach to the small town of Peel, on the way calling in at the Tynwald Exhibition. The Isle of Man isn’t part of the United Kingdom, and it has its own parliament, called Tynwald. It’s claimed that this is the world’s oldest parliament that’s still functioning and that it dates back to 979. However, the earliest surviving reference to it is from
1422 (Q16)
, so perhaps it isn’t quite as old as it claims!
Day three we have a trip to the mountain Snaefell. This begins with a leisurely ride along the promenade in Douglas in a horse-drawn tram. Then you board an electric train which takes you to the fishing village of Laxey. From there it’s an eight-kilometre ride in the Snaefell Mountain Railway to the
top (Q17)
. Lunch will be in the café, giving you spectacular views of the island.
Day four is free for you to explore, using the
pass (Q18)
which we’ll give you. So you won’t have to pay for travel on local transport, or for entrance to the island’s heritage sites. Or you might just want to take it easy in Douglas and perhaps do a little light shopping.
The last full day, day five, is for some people the highlight of the holiday, with a ride on the
steam (Q19)
railway, from Douglas to Port Erin. After some time to explore, a coach will take you to the headland that overlooks the Calf of Man, a small island just off the coast. From there you continue to Castletown, which used to be the
capital (Q20)
of the Isle of Man, and its mediaeval castle.
And on day six it’s back to the ferry – or the airport, if you flew to the island-and time to go home.
Now I’d like to tell you …

TUTOR:
Ah Caroline … come on in. Sit down.
CAROLINE:
Thanks.
TUTOR:
So how’s the dissertation planning going?
CAROLINE:
Well Dr Schulmann, I’m still having a lot of trouble deciding on a title.
TUTOR:
Well, that’s perfectly normal at this stage. And this is what your tutorials will help you to do.
CAROLINE:
Right.
TUTOR:
What we’ll do is jot down some points that might help you in your decision. First of all, you have chosen your general topic area, haven’t you?
CAROLINE:
Yes, it’s the
fishing industry (Q21)
.
TUTOR:
Oh yes, that was one of the areas you mentioned. Now, what aspects of the course are you good at?
CAROLINE:
Well, I think I’m coping well with
statistics (Q22)
, and I’m never bored by it.
TUTOR:
Good. Anything else?
CAROLINE:
Well, I found computer modelling fascinating – I have no problem following what’s being taught, whereas quite a few of my classmates find it difficult.
TUTOR:
Well, that’s very good. Do you think these might be areas you could bring into your dissertation?
CAROLINE:
Oh yes, if possible. It’s just that I’m having difficulty thinking how I can do that. You see I feel I don’t have sufficient background information.
TUTOR:
I see. Well, do you take notes?
CAROLINE:
I’m very weak at
note-taking (Q23)
. My teachers always used to say that.
TUTOR:
Well, I think you really need to work on these weaknesses before you go any further.
CAROLINE:
What do you suggest?
TUTOR:
Well, I can go through the possible strategies with you and let you decide where to go from there.
CAROLINE:
Okay, thanks.
TUTOR:
Well, some people find it helpful to organise peer-group discussions – you know, each week a different person studies a different topic and shares it with the group.
CAROLINE:
Oh right.
TUTOR:
It really helps build
confidence (Q24)
, you know, having to present something to others.
CAROLINE:
I can see that.
TUTOR:
The drawback is that everyone in the group seems to share the same
ideas (Q25)
… they keep being repeated in all the dissertations.
CAROLINE:
Okay.
TUTOR:
You could also try a service called ‘
Student Support
‘
(Q26)
. It’s designed to give you a structured programme over a number of weeks to develop your skills.
CAROLINE:
Sounds good.
TUTOR:
Yes, unfortunately, there are only a few
places (Q27)
. But it’s worth looking into.
CAROLINE:
Yes, of course. I know I’ve got to work on my study skills.
TUTOR:
And then there are several study skills books you can consult.
CAROLINE:
Right.
TUTOR:
They’ll be a good source of reference but the problem is they are sometimes too
general (Q28)
.
CAROLINE:
Yes, that’s what I’ve found.
TUTOR:
Other than that I would strongly advise quite simple ideas like using a card index.
CAROLINE:
Well, yes, I’ve never done that before.
TUTOR:
It’s simple, but it really works because you have to get points down in a small space. Another thing I always advise is don’t just take your notes and forget about them. Read everything
three times (29)
– that’ll really fix them in your mind.
CAROLINE:
Yes, I can see it’d take discipline but …
TUTOR:
Well, if you establish good study skills at this stage they’ll be with you all your life.
CAROLINE:
Oh yes, I completely agree. It’s just that I don’t seem to be able to discipline myself. I need to talk things over.
TUTOR:
Well, we’ll be continuing these tutorials of course. Let’s arrange next month’s now. Let’s see, I can see you virtually any time during the week starting  January
CAROLINE:
What about the? I’m free in the afternoon.
TUTOR:
Sorry, I’m booked then. What about the following day?
CAROLINE:
Thursday? I can make the morning.
TUTOR:
Fine, we’ll go for the
25th (Q30)
then.
CAROLINE:
That’s great, thanks.

, so they couldn’t do any transactions. They said the problem would be fixed in a few minutes, so I waited. And then I started talking to another guy in the bank, and I forgot the time.
Q2
SALLY: Oh, really? Someone you met in the bank? Does he work there?
PETER: NO,
he was
a tourist, from New York
. His name’s Henry, and he’s been here for a week, but he’s moving on to Germany tomorrow. He’s an architect, and he’s spending four weeks traveling around Europe.
Q3
SALLY: Just like us!
PETER: Yeah, just like us. He told me the names of some places where we should eat. Great food, and not too expensive, he said. Oh, and he also gave me
this map of the bus system
. He said he didn’t need it anymore.
Q4
SALLY: That’s useful. Pity he’s moving on tomorrow. Ah, here’s the waitress. Let’s order. Do you want anything to eat, or shall we just have a drink?
PETER: Well, I’m hungry, and we’ve got a lot of sightseeing to do, so let’s just have
a snack and a drink
.
Q5
SALLY: Sounds good to me!
PETER: Well, let’s decide what we’ll see today. I guess the best place to start is the Cathedral, and then the Castle. What are the opening times for those two?
SALLY: Well, according to this guidebook, the Cathedral is only open from nine-thirty in the morning until midday. No, hang on. That’s the Cathedral Museum.
The
Cathedral itself is open morning and afternoon
. The Castle is just open from one to five, so we can’t go there until after lunch. I really want to spend some time in the Art Gallery, because they’ve got this wonderful painting by Rembrandt that I’ve always wanted to see.
Q6
PETER: What else should we see?
SALLY: Well, the guidebook says the Botanical Gardens are worth spending some time in, and they’re open all day, from eight to six, so we can go there any time. I’d like to go to the Markets near the river too, but… oh… no, wait, that’s only in the mornings, too.
PETER: AS well as today and tomorrow, we can see some other places on Monday, you know.
But
I don’t think the Markets will be open then
; they only open on Thursdays, so we’ve missed them for this week. Maybe we should go to the Cathedral today because it’s Sunday tomorrow, and even though it’s open every day it might be more difficult to get in tomorrow because of the church services.
Q7
SALLY: That’s true, but the Art Gallery isn’t open on Sundays at all, so we’ll have to go there today. The Castle’s open every day except Mondays, so we’re OK there, and the Gardens of course only close at night.
PETER: Are all these places free or do we have to pay to go in? What does the guidebook say?
SALLY: I think there’s
a charge for all of them except the Botanical Gardens
. Oh, and the Markets, of course, you don’t pay to go in.
Q8
PETER: OK, well, it looks like our plan is this:
we’ll go to see the painting you like first
, the Rembrandt, then have lunch and go on to the Castle after that, and then the Cathedral.
Q9
SALLY: OK. It says here that the roof of the Cathedral is really beautiful.
PETER: IS that right? What I really want to do at the Cathedral is
climb the tower.
The view is supposed to be spectacular.
Q10
SALLY: OK, well, that’ll be more than enough for today. Then, tomorrow, let’s go to the Botanical Gardens and have a picnic. I want to sit by the river and watch the swans. This city’s famous for them.

剑桥雅思17 Test1 Part1
雅思听力
原文
PETER
: Hello?
JAN
: Oh hello. My name’s Jan. Are you the right person to talk to about the Buckworth Conservation Group?
PETER
: Yes, I’m Peter. I’m the secretary.
JAN
: Good. I’ve just moved to this area, and I’m interested in getting involved. I was in a similar group where I used to live. Could you tell me something about your activities, please?
PETER
: Of course. Well, we have a mixture of regular activities and special events. One of the regular ones is trying to keep the beach free of
litter (Q1)
. A few of us spend a couple of hours a month on it, and it’s awful how much there is to clear. I wish people would be more responsible and take it home with them.
JAN
: I totally agree. I’d be happy to help with that. Is it OK to take
dogs (Q2)
?
PETER
: I’m afraid not, as they’re banned from the beach itself. You can take them along the cliffs, though. And children are welcome.
JAN
: Right.
PETER
: We also manage a nature reserve, and there’s a lot to do there all year round. For example, because it’s a popular place to visit, we spend a lot of time looking after the paths and making sure they’re in good condition for walking.
JAN
: I could certainly help with that.
PETER
: Good. And we have a programme of creating new habitats there. We’ve just finished making and installing nesting boxes for birds to use, and next we’re going to work on encouraging
insects (Q3)
– they’re important for the biodiversity of the reserve.
JAN
: They certainly are.
PETER
: Oh, and we’re also running a project to identify the different species of
butterflies (Q4)
that visit the reserve. You might be interested in taking part in that.
JAN
: Sure. I was involved in something similar where I used to live, counting all the species of moths. I’d enjoy that.
PETER
: Another job we’re doing at the reserve is replacing the
wall (Q5)
on the southern side, between the parking area and our woodshed. It was badly damaged in a storm last month.
JAN
: OK
PETER
: Then as I said, we have a programme of events as well, both at the weekend, and during the week.
JAN
: Right. I presume you have guided walks? I’d like to get to know the local countryside, as I’m new to the area.
PETER
: Yes, we do. The next walk is to Ruston Island, a week on Saturday. We’ll be meeting in the car park at Dunsmore Beach at low tide – that’s when the sands are dry enough for us to walk to the
island (Q6)
without getting wet.
JAN
: Sounds good
PETER
: The island’s a great place to explore. It’s quite small, and it’s got a range of habitats. It’s also an ideal location for seeing seals just off the coast, or even on the beach.
JAN
: OK. And is there anything we should bring, like a picnic, for instance?
PETER
: Yes, do bring one, as it’s a full-day walk. And of course it’ll be wet walking across and back, so make sure your
boots (Q7)
are waterproof.
JAN
: I must buy a new pair – there’s a hole in one of my current ones! Well, I’d definitely like to come on the walk.
PETER
: Great. Then later this month we’re having a one-day woodwork session in Hopton Wood.
JAN
: I’ve never tried that before. Is it OK for
beginners (Q8)
to take part?
PETER
: Definitely. There’ll be a couple of experts leading the session, and we keep the number of participants down, so you’ll get as much help as you need.
JAN
: Excellent! I’d love to be able to make chairs.
PETER
: That’s probably too ambitious for one day! You’ll be starting with wooden
spoons (Q9)
, and of course learning how to use the tools. And anything you make is yours to take home with you.
JAN
: That sounds like fun. When is it?
PETER
: It’s on the 17th, from 10 a.m. until 3. There’s a charge of
£35 (Q10)
, including lunch, or £40 if you want to camp in the wood.
JAN
: I should think I’ll come home the same day. Well, I’d certainly like to join the group.

原文
MIA
: Hi, Rob.
How’s the course going?
ROB
: Oh, hi, Mia.
Yeah, great.
I can’t believe the first term’s nearly over.
MIA
: I saw your group’s performance last night at the student theatre.
It was good.
ROB
: Really?
Yeah …
but now we have to write a report on the whole thing, an
in-depth
analysis.
I don’t know where to start.
Like, I have to write about the role I played, the doctor, how I developed the character.
MIA
: Well, what was your starting point?
ROB
: Er…
my grandfather was a doctor before he retired, and I just based it on him.
MIA
: OK, but how?
Did you talk to him about it?
ROB
: He must have all sorts of stories, but he never says much about his work, even now.
He has a sort of authority though.
MIA
: So how did you manage to capture that?
ROB
:
I’d… I’d
visualise
what he must have been like in the past, when he was sitting in his consulting room listening to his patients  (Q21)
.
MIA
: OK, so that’s what you explain in your report.
ROB
: Right.
MIA
: Then there’s the issue of atmosphere—so in the first scene we needed to know how boring life was in the doctor’s village in the 1950s, so when the curtain went up on the first scene in the waiting room, there was that long silence before anyone spoke.
And then
people kept saying the same thing over and over, like ‘Cold, isn’t it?’ (Q22)
ROB
: Yes, and everyone wore grey and brown, and just sat in a row.
MIA
: Yes, all those details of the production.
ROB
: And I have to analyse how I functioned in the group—what I found out about myself.
I know I was so
frustrated
at times, when we couldn’t agree.
MIA
: Yes.
So did one person emerge as the leader?
ROB
: Sophia did.
That was OK—
she helped us work out exactly what to do (Q23)
, for the production.
And that made me feel better, I suppose.
MIA
: When you understood what needed doing?
ROB
: Yes.
And Sophia did some research, too.
That was useful in developing our approach.
MIA
: Like what?
ROB
: Well,
she found these articles from the 1950s about how relationships between children and their parents, or between the public and people like bank managers or the police were shifting (Q24)
.
MIA
: Interesting.
And did you have any practical problems to overcome?
ROB
: Well, in the final
rehearsal
everything was going fine until the last scene -that’s where the doctor’s first patient appears on stage on his own.
MIA
: The one in the wheelchair?
ROB
: Yes, and he had this really long speech, with the stage all dark except for one
spotlight
— and then
that stuck somehow so it was shining on the wrong side of the stage (Q25)
… but anyway we got that fixed, thank goodness.
MIA
: Yes, it was fine on the night.
ROB
: But while you’re here, Mia.
I wanted to ask you about the year abroad option.
Would you recommend doing that?
MIA
: Yes, definitely.
It’s a fantastic chance to study in another country for a year.
ROB
: I think I’d like to do it, but it looks very
competitive
—there’s only a limited number of places.
MIA
: Yes,
so next year when you are in the second year of the course, you need to work really hard in all your theatre studies modules.
Only students with marks get places — you have to prove that you know your subject really well (Q26)
.
ROB
: Right.
So how did you choose where to go?
MIA
: Well,
I decided I wanted a programme that would fit in with what I wanted to do after I graduate, so I looked for a university with emphasis on acting rather than directing for example (Q27)
.
It depends on you.
Then about six months before you go,
you have to email the
scheme
coordinator
with your top three choices.
I had a friend who missed the deadline and didn’t get her first choice (Q28)
, so you do need to get a move on at that stage.
You’ll find that certain places are very popular with everyone.
ROB
: And don’t you have to write a personal statement at that stage?
MIA
: Yes.
ROB
: Right.
I’ll get some of the final year students to give me some tips (Q29)
…
maybe see if I can read what they wrote.
MIA
: I think that’s a very good idea.
I don’t mind showing you what I did.
And while you’re abroad don’t make the mistake I made.
I got so involved I forgot all about making arrangements for when I came back here for the final year (Q30)
.
Make sure you stay in touch so they know your choices for the optional modules.
You don’t want to miss out doing your preferred specialisms.
ROB
: Right.

剑桥雅思16Test3Part3听力答案解析 Artificial sweeteners
剑桥雅思16 Test3 Part3
雅思听力
原文
ADAM:
OK Rosie, shall we try to get some ideas together for our presentation on diet and obesity?
ROSIE:
Sure.
ADAM:
I can talk about the experiment I did to see if people can tell the difference between real sugar and artificial sweeteners.
ROSIE:
Where you gave people drinks with either sugar or artificial sweeteners and they had to say which they thought it was?
ADAM:
Yeah. It took me ages to decide exactly how I’d organise it, especially how could make sure that
people didn’t know which drink l was giving them (Q21)
. It was hard to keep track of it all, especially as
I had so many people doing it (Q22)
– I had to make sure I kept a proper record of what each person had had
ROSIE:
So could most people tell the difference?
ADAM:
Yeah – I hadn’t thought they would be able to, but most people could.
ROSIE:
Then there’s that experiment I did measuring the fat content of nuts, to see if the nutritional information given on the packet was accurate.
ADAM:
The one where you ground up the nuts and mixed them with a chemical to absorb the fat?
ROSIE:
Yes. My results were a bit problematic -the fat content for that type of nut seemed much lower than it said on the package. But I reckon the package information was right. I think
I should probably have ground up the nuts more than I did (Q23)
.
It’s possible that the scales for weighing the fat weren’t accurate enough (Q24)
, too. I’d really like to try the experiment again some time.
ADAM:
So what can we say about helping people to lose weight?
There’s a lot we could say about what restaurants could do to reduce obesity. I read that the items at the start of a menu and the items at the end of a menu are much more likely to be chosen than the items in the middle.
So, if you put the low-calorie items at the beginning and end of the menu, people will probably go for the food with fewer calories (Q25)
, without even realising what they’re doing.
Rosie:
I think food manufacturers could do more to encourage healthy eating.
ADAM:
How?
ROSIE:
Well,
when manufacturers put calorie counts of a food on the label, they’re sometimes really confusing and I suspect they do it on purpose (Q26)
. Because food that’s high in calories tastes better, and so they’ll sell more.
ADAM:
Yeah, so if you look at the amount of calories in a pizza, they’ll give you the calories per quarter pizza and you think, oh that’s not too bad. But who’s going to eat a quarter pizza?
ROSIE:
Exactly.
ADAM:
I suppose another approach to this problem is to get people to exercise more.
ROSIE:
Right. In England, the current guidelines are for at least 30 minutes of brisk walking, five days a week. Now when you ask them,
about 40% of men and 30% of women say they do this, but when you objectively measure the amount of walking they do with motion sensors, you find that only 6% of men and 4% of women do the recommended amount of exercise (Q27)
.
ADAM:
Mm, so you can see why obesity is growing.
ROSIE:
So how can people be encouraged to take more exercise?
ADAM:
Well, for example, think of the location of stairs in a train station. If people reach the stairs before they reach the escalator when they’re leaving the station, they’re more likely to take the stairs, And if you increase the width of the stairs, you’ll get more people using them at the same time.
It’s an unconscious process and influenced by minor modifications in their environment (Q28)
.
ROSIE:
Right. And it might not be a big change, but if it happens every day, it all adds up.
ADAM:
Yes. But actually,
I’m not sure if we should be talking about exercise in our presentation (Q29)
.
ROSIE:
Well, we’ve done quite a bit of reading about it
ADAM:
I know, but it’s going to mean we have a very wide focus, and our tutor did say that
we need to focus on causes and solutions in terms of nutrition (Q29)
.
ROSIE:
I suppose so. And we’ve got plenty of information about that. OK, well that will be simpler.
ADAM:
So what shall we do now? We’ve still got half an hour before our next lecture.
ROSIE:
Let’s think about what we’re going to include and what will go where (Q30)
. Then we can decide what slides we need.
ADAM:
OK, fine.

ROB:
Good morning.
Stretton Festival box office.
How can I help you?
MELANIE:
Oh, hello.
My family and I are on holiday in the area, and we’ve seen some posters about the festival this week.
Could you tell me about some of the events, please?
ROB:
Of course.
MELANIE:
First of all, are there still tickets available for the jazz band on Saturday?
ROB:
There are, but only (Example) ￡15.
The ￡12 seats have all been sold.
MELANIE:
OK.
And the venue is the school, isn’t it?
ROB:
Yes, that’s right, the
secondary
(Q1)
school
.
Make sure you don’t go to the primary school by mistake!
And there’s an additional
performer
who isn’t mentioned on the posters – Carolyn Hart is going to play with the band.
MELANIE:
Oh, I think I’ve heard her on the radio.
Doesn’t she play the oboe, or flute or something?
ROB:
Yes the
flute (Q2)
.
She usually plays with
symphony
orchestras, and apparently this is her first time with a jazz band.
MELANIE:
Well, I’d certainly like to hear her.
Then the next thing I want to ask about is the duck races – I saw a poster beside a river.
What are they, exactly?
ROB:
Well, you buy a yellow
plastic
duck – or as many as you like – they’re a pound each.
And you write your name on each one.
There’ll be several races, depending on the number of ducks taking part.
And John Stevens, a
champion
swimmer who lives locally, is going to start the races.
All the ducks will be launched into the river at the back of the
cinema (Q3)
, then they’ll
float
along the river for 500 metres, as far as the railway bridge.
MELANIE:
And are there any prizes?
ROB:
Yes, the first duck in each race to arrive at the finishing line wins its owner
free tickets
for the
concert (Q4)
on the last night of the festival.
MELANIE:
You said you can buy a duck?
I’m sure my children will both want one.
ROB:
They’re on sale at a stall in the
market
(Q5)
.
You can’t miss it – it’s got an enormous sign showing a couple of ducks.
MELANIE:
OK.
I’ll go there this afternoon.
I remember walking past there yesterday.
Now could you tell me something about the flower show, please?
ROB:
Well, admission is free, and the show is being held in Bythwaite Hall.
MELANIE:
Sorry, how do you spell that?
ROB:
B-Y-T-H-W-A-I-T-E.
Bythwaite
(Q6)
.
MELANIE:
Is it easy to find?
I’m not very familiar with the town yet.
ROB:
Oh, you won’t have any problem.
It’s right in the centre of Stretton.
It’s the only old building in the town, so it’s easy to recognise.
MELANIE:
I know it.
I presume it’s open all day.
ROB:
Yes, but if you’d like to see the prizes being awarded for the best flowers, you’ll need to be there at 5 o’clock.
The prizes are being given by a famous
actor
(Q7)
, Kevin Shapless.
He lives nearby and gets involved in a lot of community events.
MELANIE:
Gosh
, I’ve seen him on TV.
I’ll definitely go to the prize-giving.
ROB:
Right.
MELANIE:
I’ve seen a list of plays that are being performed this week, and I’d like to know which are suitable for my children, and which ones my husband and I might go to.
ROB:
How old are your children?
MELANIE:
Five and seven.
What about ‘The Mystery of Muldoon’?
ROB:
That’s aimed at five to ten-year-olds
(Q8)
.
MELANIE:
So if I take my children, I can expect them to enjoy it more than I do?
ROB:
I think so.
If you’d like something for yourself and your husband, and leave your children with a babysitter, you might like to see ‘Fire and Flood’
(Q9)
– it’s about events that really happened in Stretton two hundred years ago, and children might find it rather frightening.
MELANIE:
Oh, thanks for the warning.
And finally, what about ‘Silly Sailor’?
ROB:
That’s a comedy, and it’s for
young and old
(Q10)
.
In fact, it won an award in the Stretton Drama Festival a couple of months ago.
MELANIE:
OK.
Well, goodbye, and thanks for all the information.
I’m looking forward to the festival!
ROB:
Goodbye.

原文
CLERK:                   Conference Centre Reservations. Good morning.
WOMAN:                 Hi. I’m interested in the computing conference next month.
CLERK:
Future Directions
in Computing?
Example
WOMAN:                 Yes, that’s right. Could I ask you a few questions about it?
CLERK:                   Of course.
WOMAN:                 OK. I know the conference is for three days but actually I want to attend on the Friday and Saturday only. Will that work out to be any cheaper?
CLERK:                   Let me have a look. Well, you could register for the two days separately, but that wouldn’t actually save you very much as it still costs ￡35 for each day. In fact, if you could register for the three days, you also get an invitation to a free dinner on the Saturday night, so that’s probably the better option.
WOMAN:                 Right, I’ll do that. How much will the fees be in that case?
CLERK:                   It’s
￡75
.
Q1
WOMAN:                 All right. I’d like to register for the full three days. Now, can I pay that by credit card?
CLERK:                   I’m afraid not. You’ll have to send a
cheque
to us, or you can pay at the conference office.
Q2
WOMAN:                 Fine. So it’s probably easiest if I pay by cheque. Now then, what else do I need to arrange? Right. How about accommodation? I guess that’s not included in the price?
CLERK:                   No, I’m sorry, it’s not, but we do have a few rooms available for delegates at the conference centre if you’d like. Those are very cheap but if you’re interested you’ll need to book soon, because there’s always a heavy demand for them. They are only
￡15
per night, but they are very basic and you’d have to get your own breakfast, because they don’t provide you with that. But it’s very convenient, because it’s in the same building as the conference rooms.
Q3
WOMAN:                 Uhuh.
CLERK:                   Or there’s a very reasonable guest house which is
￡25
per night. And I think that includes your breakfast.
Q4
WOMAN:                 Is it close to the conference centre?
CLERK:                   It would be about
a ten-minute walk away from here
.
Q5
WOMAN:                 I see. That sounds quite reasonable.
CLERK:                   The details are all in our
conference pack

剑9 test 1 Section 4
雅思听力
原文
Good afternoon everyone. Well, with some of you about to go out on field work it’s timely that in this afternoon’s session I’ll be sharing some ideas about the reasons why groups of whales and dolphins sometimes swim ashore from the sea right onto the beach and, most often, die in what are known as ‘mass strandings’.
Unfortunately, this type of event is a frequent occurrence in some of the locations that you’ll be travelling to, where sometimes the
tide (Q31)
goes out suddenly, confusing the animals. However, there are many other theories about the causes of mass strandings.
The first is that the behaviour is linked to parasites. It’s often found that stranded animals were infested with large numbers of parasites. For instance, a type of worm is commonly found in the
ears (Q32)
of dead whales. Since marine animals rely heavily on their hearing to navigate, this type of infestation has the potential to be very harmful
.
Another theory is related to toxins, or poisons. These have also been found to contribute to the death of many marine animals. Many toxins, as I’m sure you’re aware, originate from plants, or
animals (Q33).
The whale ingests these toxins in its normal feeding behaviour but whether these poisons directly or indirectly lead to stranding and death, seems to depend upon the toxin involved.
In 1988, for example, fourteen humpback whales examined after stranding along the beaches of Cape Cod were found to have been poisoned after eating tuna that contained saxitoxin, the same toxin that can be fatal in humans.
Alternatively, it has also been suggested that some animals strand accidentally by following their prey ashore in the confusion of the chase. In 1995 David Thurston monitored pilot whales that beached after following squid ashore. However, this idea does not seem to hold true for the majority of mass strandings because examination of the animals’ stomach contents reveal that most had not been
feeding (Q34)
as they stranded
.
There are also some new theories which link strandings to humans. A growing concern is that
loud
noises (Q35)
in the ocean cause strandings. Noises such as those caused by military exercises are of particular concern and have been pinpointed as the cause of some strandings of late.
One of these, a mass stranding of whales in 2000 in the Bahamas coincided closely with experiments using a new submarine detection system. There were several factors that made this stranding stand out as different from previous strandings. This led researchers to look for a new cause. For one, all the stranded animals were
healthy (Q36)
. In addition, the animals were spread out along 38 kilometres of coast, whereas it’s more common for the animals to be found in a
group (Q37)
when mass strandings occur.
A final theory is related to group behaviour, and suggests that sea mammals cannot distinguish between sick and healthy leaders and will follow sick leaders, even to an inevitable death. This is a particularly interesting theory since the whales that are thought to be most
social (Q38)
– the toothed whales – are the group that strand the most frequently.
The theory is also supported by evidence from a dolphin stranding in 1994. Examination of the dead animals revealed that apart from the
leader (Q39)
, all the others had been healthy at the time of their death.
Without one consistent theory, however, it is very hard for us to do anything about this phenomenon except to assist animals where and when we can. Stranding networks have been established around the world to aid in rescuing animals and collecting samples from those that could not be helped. I recommend John Connor’s
Marine Mammals Ashore
as an excellent starting point if you’re interested in finding out more about these
networks (Q40)
, or establishing one yourself.

剑桥雅思4 test 3 Section 3听力原文与答案
这篇Section 3由10道选择题构成，不过难度都不算太大。无论是题干还是选项都比较短，读题时间充足。干扰项设置的也十分简单，跟现在考试Section 3的难度完全不在一个层级。
易错点主要有三个。22题，28题，和30题。其中，22题的同义替换比较出人意料，直接给出两个日期作为两天的替换内容，很多同学一时反应不过来。28题的难点主要在于听力原文中使用了consecutive（连续的）一词，不少同学都不认识，最后只能根据听到的Monday随便选一个。30题与29题的距离太近，很容易漏过去。但只要及时关注了，本身的难度并不算大。

剑4 test 3 Section 3
雅思听力
原文
OFFICER: Hello. Er, I’m Dawn Matthews.
STUDENT: Yes, hello. I’ve been referred to you because I’m enquiring about the refresher courses that you run. I’d like to find out a bit more about them.
OFFICER: OK. Well, we run quite a few different short courses for students who are either
returning to study
or studying part-time. Um, tell me about your situation.
Q21
STUDENT: Well, I think that I really need some help in preparing for the coming semester, especially to build up my confidence a bit and help me study effectively because, you see, I’ve been out in the work-force for nearly twelve years now, so it really is a long time since I was last a student.
OFFICER: Yes, it can seem like a long time, can’t it? Um, well, let me start by telling you what courses we have that might suit you. Are you an undergraduate or a postgraduate? Arts or Sciences?
STUDENT: Undergraduate, and I’m in the Business faculty.
OFFICER: Right then. First of all, there’s our intensive ‘Study for Success’ seminar on
the first and second of February
. It’s aimed at students like you who are uncertain about what to expect at college, and looks at a fairly wide range of approaches to university learning, to motivate you to begin your study and build on your own learning strategies.
Q22
STUDENT: Mm, that sounds good. What are some of the strategies that are presented?
OFFICER: Well, we try to cover all aspects of the study. Some of the strategies in writing, for example, would be improving your planning for writing, organizing your thinking and building some techniques to help you
write more clearly
. With reading, there’ll be sessions aimed at getting into the habit of
analyzing material
as you read it, and tips to help you record and remember what you have read. It really is very important to begin reading confidently right from the beginning.
Q23 Q24
STUDENT: Mm.
OFFICER: There’s also advice on how to get the most from your lectures and practice in giving confident presentations, as well as how to prepare for exams.
STUDENT: What about the motivational side of things?
OFFICER: Ah. Well, there’s a range of motivational exercises that we do to help the students feel
positive and enthusiastic about their studies
. The process of learning and exploring a subject can lead to a whole new way of looking at the world, and the study skills and techniques that you build up can be applied in all sorts of different ways.
Q25
STUDENT: Actually, I… I’m very excited about the whole thing of taking up studying again but, you know, I’m a little nervous about whether I’ll manage to get everything done. I suppose it’s the same for all mature students?
OFFICER: Of course it is. Two of the key components of the course are
time management
and overcoming procrastination. People discover that, once they learn to plan their days, all the work can be accomplished and there’ll still be time for leisure.
Q26
STUDENT: IS there an enrolment fee?
OFFICER: Well, er, oh, just a minute, let’s see… Ah, the cost is thirty pounds, which includes all course materials and morning tea. You have to arrange your own lunch.
STUDENT: That wouldn’t be a problem. I already make sandwiches for my three kids and my wife and myself every day. I won’t have to change my routine.
OFFICER: No. Now, I need to tell you that this is a very popular course and it’s essential that you
book well ahead of time
. In fact, the Course Convenor tells me that there are only five places left.
Q27
STUDENT: What other courses might be good for me?
OFFICER: There is one other that you could benefit from. It’s simply called ‘Learning Skills for University Study’ and is
on three consecutive mornings starting on a Monday
, from nine to twelve, and costs twenty-five pounds. This is aimed at upgrading the study skills most school-leavers have and help them cope with the increased demands of university study. It focuses mainly on making students more responsible for their own success.
Q28
STUDENT: What sort of things are covered in this course?
OFFICER: Well, basically it’s more advanced thinking, note-taking, reading and writing strategies, but also some input about
stress management
.
Q29
STUDENT: I think I’d be better off
starting from the basics
and looking at all the strategies, don’t you?
Q30
OFFICER: Yes, from what you’ve told me, I think that’s more in line with your situation.
STUDENT: Alright then, um, can I book a place on the ‘Study for Success’ seminar course now?
OFFICER: Yes. Let me just get out a registration form and take down your details.

剑桥雅思18听力第二套题目第一部分为求职场景。具体内容包括Milo餐厅所提供的各项福利，对应聘者的要求，以及目前空缺的岗位。没有什么特别出乎意料的地方。下面是这段音频对应的录音原文与相应题目的答案。
剑桥雅思18Test2Part1听力答案解析 Working at Milo’s Restaurants
剑桥雅思18 Test2 Part1
雅思听力
原文
WOMAN:
So, I understand you’re interested in restaurant work?
MAN:
Yes. I’ve got a bit of experience and I can provide references.
WOMAN:
That’s good. I can check all that later. Now, Milo’s Restaurants have some vacancies at the moment. They’re a really good company to work for. Lots of benefits.
MAN:
Oh right.
WOMAN:
Yes. They’ve got a very good reputation for looking after staff. For example, all employees get
training (Q1)
– even temporary staff.
MAN:
Oh really? That’s quite unusual, isn’t it?
WOMAN:
Certainly is.
MAN:
And do staff get free uniforms too?
WOMAN:
Um … you just need to wear a white T-shirt and black trousers, it says here. So I guess not … But another benefit of working for a big company like this is that you can get a
discount (Q2)
at any of their restaurants.
MAN:
Even at weekends?
WOMAN:
No, but you’ll be working then anyway.
MAN:
Oh yes. I suppose so. Most of their restaurants are in the city centre, aren’t they? So, easy to get to by bus?
WOMAN:
Yes. That’s right. But if you have to do a late shift and finish work after midnight, the company will pay for you to get a
taxi (Q3)
home.
MAN:
I probably won’t need one. I think I’d use my bike.
WOMAN:
Now, they do have some quite specific requirements for the kind of person they’re looking for. Milo’s is a young, dynamic company and they’re really keen on creating a strong team. It’s really important that you can fit in and get on well with everyone.
MAN:
Yeah. I’ve got no problem with that. It sounds good, actually. The last place I worked for was quite demanding too. We had to make sure we gave a really high level of
service (Q4)
.
WOMAN:
That’s good to hear because that will be equally important at Milo’s. I know they want people who have an eye for detail.
MAN:
That’s fine.I’m very used to working in that kind of environment.
WOMAN:
Perfect. So the only other thing that’s required is good communication skills, so you’ll need to have a certificate in
English (Q5)
.
MAN:
Sure.
WOMAN:
Let’s have a look at the current job vacancies at Milo’s. The first one is in
Wivenhoe (Q6)
Street.
MAN:
Sorry, where?
WOMAN:
Wivenhoe. W-I-V-E-N-H-O-E. It’s quite central, just off Cork Street.
MAN:
Oh right.
WOMAN:
They’re looking for a breakfast supervisor.
MAN:
That would be OK.
WOMAN:
So you’re probably familiar with the kind of responsibilities involved. Obviously checking that all the portions are correct, etc., and then things like checking all the procedures for cleaning the
equipment (Q7)
are being followed.
MAN:
OK. And what about the salary? In my last job I was getting 9.50 pounds per hour. I was hoping to get a bit more than that.
WOMAN:
Well, to begin with you’d be getting
9.75 (Q8)
pounds but that goes up to 11.25 pounds after three months.
MAN:
That’s not too bad. And I suppose it’s a very early start?
WOMAN:
Mmm. That’s the only unattractive thing about this job. But then you have the afternoons and evenings free. So the restaurant starts serving breakfast from 7 a.m.And you’d have to be there at 5.30 to set everything up. But you’d be finished at 12.30.
MAN:
Mmm.Well, as you say, there are advantages to that.
WOMAN:
Now, you might also be interested in the job at the City Road branch. That’s for a junior chef, so again a position of responsibility.
MAN:
I might prefer that, actually.
WOMAN:
Right, well obviously this role would involve supporting the sous chef and other senior staff. And you’d be responsible for making sure there’s enough stock each week – and sorting out all the
deliveries (Q9)
.
MAN:
I’ve never done that before, but l imagine it’s fairly straightforward, once you get the hang of it.
WOMAN:
Yes, and you’d be working alongside more experienced staff to begin with, so I’m sure it wouldn’t be a problem. The salary’s slightly higher here. It’s an annual salary of E23,000.
MAN:
Right.
WOMAN:
I know that if they like you, it’s likely you’ll be promoted quite quickly. So that’s worth thinking about.
MAN:
Yes. It does sound interesting. What are the hours like?
WOMAN:
The usual, I think. There’s a lot of evening and weekend work, but they’re closed on Mondays. But you do get one
Sunday (Q10)
off every four weeks. So would you like me to send off your …

ANGELA: You have. I’m the customer services manager. My name’s ANGELA. So how can I help you?
MAN: Well, I’m calling from Barrett and Stansons, we’re a medical company based in Perth.
ANGELA: Oh yes.
MAN: And we’re organising a conference for our clients to be held in Sydney. It’ll be held over two days and we’re expecting about fifty or sixty people.
ANGELA: When were you thinking of having it?
MAN: Some time early next year, like the end of January? It’d have to be a weekend.
ANGELA: Let me see … our conference facilities are already booked for the weekend beginning January 28th. We could do the first weekend in February?
MAN: How about January 21st?
ANGELA: I’m afraid that’s booked too.
MAN: Well, let’s go for the February date then.
ANGELA: So that’s the weekend beginning the 4th.
MAN: OK. Now can you tell me a bit about what conference facilities you have?
ANGELA: Sure. So for talks and presentations we have the Tesla room.
MAN: Sorry?
ANGELA:
Tesla – that’s spelled T-E-S-L-A (Q1)
. It holds up to a hundred people, and it’s fully equipped with a projector and so on.
MAN: How about a
microphone (Q2)
?
ANGELA: Yes, that’ll be all set up ready for you, and there’ll be one that members of the audience can use too, for questions, if necessary.
MAN: Fine. And we’ll also need some sort of open area where people can sit and have a cup of coffee, and we’d like to have an
exhibition (Q3)
of our products and services there as well, so that’ll need to be quite a big space.
ANGELA: That’s fine, there’s a central atrium with all those facilities, and you can come before the conference starts if you want to set everything up.
MAN: Great. And I presume there’s
wifi (Q4)
?
ANGELA: Oh yes, that’s free and available throughout the hotel.
MAN: OK.
ANGELA: Would you also like us to provide a buffet lunch? We can do a two-course meal with a number of different options.
MAN: What sort of price are we looking at for that?
ANGELA: Well, I can send you a copy of the standard menu. That’s
$45 (Q5)
per person. Or you can have the special for $25 more.
MAN: I think the standard should be OK, but yes, send me the menu.
MAN: Now we’re also going to need accommodation on the Saturday night for some of the participants … I’m not sure how many, but probably about 25. So what do you charge for a room?
ANGELA: Well, for conference attendees we have a 25% reduction, so we can offer you rooms at
$135 (Q6)
. Normally a standard room’s $180.
MAN: And does that include breakfast?
ANGELA: Sure. And of course, guests can also make use of all the other facilities at the hotel. So we’ve got a spa where you can get massages and facials and so on, and there’s a
pool (Q7)
up on the roof for the use of guests.
MAN: Great. Now what about transport links? The hotel’s downtown, isn’t it?
ANGELA: Yes, it’s about 12 kilometres from the
airport (Q8)
, but there’s a complimentary shuttle bus for guests. And it’s only about ten minutes’ walk from the central railway station.
MAN: OK. Now, I don’t know Sydney very well, can you just give me an idea of the location of the hotel?
ANGELA: Well, it’s downtown on Wilby Street, that’s quite a small street, and it’s not very far from the
sea (Q9)
. And of course if the conference attendees want to go out on the Saturday evening there’s a huge choice of places to eat. Then if they want to make a night of it, they can go on to one of the

in the area – there are a great many to choose from.

剑桥雅思16Test4Part4听力答案解析 The extinction of the Dodo bird
剑桥雅思16 Test4 Part4
雅思听力
原文
One of the most famous cases of extinction is that of a bird known as the dodo. In fact there’s even a saying in English, ‘as dead as the dodo’, used to refer to something which no longer exists. But for many centuries the dodo was alive and well, although it could only be found in one place, the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It was a very large bird, about one metre tall, and over the centuries it had lost the ability to fly. but it survived happily under the trees that covered the island.
Then in the year 1507 the first Portuguese ships stopped at the island. The sailors were carrying
spices (Q31)
back to Europe, and found the island a convenient stopping place where they could stock up with food and water for the rest of the voyage, but they didn’t settle on Mauritius. However, in 1638 the Dutch arrived and set up a
colony (Q32)
there. These first human inhabitants of the island found the dodo birds a convenient source of meat, although not everyone liked the taste.
It’s hard to get an accurate description of what the dodo actually looked like. We do have some written records from sailors, and a few pictures, but we don’t know how reliable these are. The best-known picture is a Dutch painting in which the bird appears to be extremely
fat (Q33)
, but this may not be accurate – an Indian painting done at the same time shows a much thinner bird.
Although attempts were made to preserve the bodies of some of the birds, no complete specimen survives. In the early 17th century four dried parts of a bird were known to exist – of these, three have disappeared, so only one example of soft tissue from the dodo survives, a dodo
head (Q34)
. Bones have also been found, but there’s only one complete skeleton in existence.
This single dodo skeleton has recently been the subject of scientific research which suggests that many of the earlier beliefs about dodos may have been incorrect. For example, early accounts of the birds mention how slow and clumsy it was, but scientists now believe the bird’s strong knee joints would have made it capable of
movement (Q35)
which was not slow, but actually quite fast. In fact,  one 17th century sailor wrote that he found the birds hard to catch. It’s true that the dodo’s small wings wouldn’t have allowed it to leave the ground, but the scientists suggest that these were probably employed for
balance (Q36)
while going over uneven ground. Another group of scientists carried out analysis of the dodo’s skull. They found that the reports of the lack of intelligence of the dodo were not borne out by their research, which suggested the bird’s
brain (Q37)
was not small, but average in size. In fact, in relation to its body size, it was similar to that of the pigeon, which is known to be a highly intelligent bird. The researchers also found that the structure of the bird’s skull suggested that one sense which was particularly well-developed was that of
smell (Q38)
. So the dodo may also have been particularly good at locating ripe fruit and other food in the island’s thick vegetation.
So it looks as if the dodo was better able to survive and defend itself than was originally believed. Yet less than 200 years after Europeans first arrived on the island, they had become extinct. So what was the reason for this? For a long time, it was believed that the dodos were hunted to extinction, but scientists now believe the situation was more complicated than this. Another factor may have been the new species brought to the island by the sailors. These included dogs, which would have been a threat to the dodos, and also monkeys, which ate the fruit that was the main part of the dodos’ diet. These were brought to the island deliberately, but the ships also brought another type of creature –
rats (Q39)
, which came to land from the ships and rapidly overran the island. These upset the ecology of the island, not just the dodos but other species too. However, they were a particular danger to the dodos because they consumed their eggs, and since each dodo only laid one at a time, this probably had a devastating effect on populations.
However, we now think that probably the main cause of the birds’ extinction was not the introduction of non-native species, but the introduction of agriculture. This meant that the
forest (Q40)
that had once covered all the island, and that had provided a perfect home for the dodo, was cut down so that crops such as sugar could be grown. So although the dodo had survived for thousands of years, suddenly it was gone.

剑桥雅思4 test 1 Section 1的这10道题目是典型的旅游场景。其内容涉及旅游的目的地，特点，费用，人数，出发时间，报名方式，日期，地点等这一场景下几乎必考的知识点。不过相对于正式考试而言，这道题目稍显简单，尤其是后面6道表格填空题，重复考察了各种地点词汇。这在真正考试中很少出现。
这部分的易错点主要有两个：其一是第二题的guided tour。一方面它在听力音频中语气较弱，很容易一不小心漏过去。另一方面，guided的尾音d和tour的头音t会发生吞音，不容易识别。其二是第4题的notice board。不少辨音基础较差的同学会写成note book。
以下是剑4 test 1 Section 1雅思听力题目对应的原文，以供大家参考：
MAN: Good morning.
WOMAN: Good morning. How can I help you?
MAN: I understand that the school organizes… umm, trips to different…
WOMAN: Yes, we run
five every month
: three during weekends and two Wednesday afternoon trips.  Example
MAN: What sort of places?
WOMAN: Well, obviously it varies, but always places of historical interest and also which offer
a variety of shopping
,
because our students always ask about that… and then we go for ones where we know there are
guided tours
,
because this gives a good focus for the visit.
Q1 Q2
MAN: Do you travel far?
WOMAN: Well, we’re lucky here, obviously, because we’re able to say that all our visits are less than three hours’ drive.
MAN: How much do they cost?
WOMAN: Again it varies – between five and fifteen pounds a head, depending on the distance.
MAN: Ah ha…
WOMAN: Oh, and we do offer to arrange special trips if, you know, there are
more than twelve
people.
Q3
MAN: Oh right, I’ll keep that in mind. And what are the times normally?
WOMAN: We try to keep it pretty fixed so that, that students get to know the pattern.  We leave at eight-thirty a.m. and return at six p.m. We figure it’s best to keep the day fairly short. MAN: Oh yes. And how do we reserve a place?
WOMAN: You sign your name on the
notice board
. Do you know where it is?
Q4
MAN: Ah ha. I saw it this morning.
WOMAN: And we do ask that you sign up three days in advance so we know we’ve got enough people interested to run it, and we can cancel if necessary, with full refund of course.
MAN: That’s fine, thanks.
MAN: And what visits are planned for this term?
WOMAN: Right, well I’m afraid the schedule hasn’t been printed out yet, but we have confirmed the dates and planned the optional extra visits which you can also book in advance if you want to.
MAN: Oh that’s all right. If you can just give some idea of the weekend ones so I can, you know, work out when to see friends, etcetera.
WOMAN: Oh sure. Well, the first one is St Ives. That’s on
the thirteenth of February
and
we’ll have only sixteen places available ‘cos we’re going by minibus. And that’s a day in town with the optional extra of visiting the Hepworth Museum.
Q5
MAN: Oh right… yeah… that sounds good.
WOMAN: Then there’s a London trip on the sixteenth of February and we’ll be taking a medium-sized coach so there’ll be forty-five places on that, and, let’s see, the optional extra is
the
Tower of London
.  Q6
MAN: Oh, I’ve already been there.
WOMAN: After that there’s
Bristol
on the third of March.
Q7
MAN: Where?
WOMAN:
Bristol… B-R-I-S-T-O-L.
MAN: OK…
WOMAN: That’s in a different minibus with eighteen places available, oh, and the optional extra is a visit to the S.S. Great Britain.
MAN: OK…
WOMAN: We’re going to Salisbury on the eighteenth of March and that’s always a popular one because the optional extra is Stonehenge, so we’re taking the large coach with fifty seats…
MAN: Oh good.
WOMAN: And then the last one is to Bath on the twenty-third of March.
MAN: Oh yes. Is Bath the Roman city?
WOMAN: Yes, that’s right, and that’s in the sixteen-seater minibus.
MAN: And where’s the optional visit?
WOMAN: It’s to the
American
Museum
–
well worth a visit.
Q8
MAN: OK, well that’s great, thanks for all that…
WOMAN: My pleasure. By the way, if you want more information about any of the trips, have a look in the
student newspaper
.  Q9
MAN: OK.
WOMAN: Or, have a word with my assistant; her name is Jane
Yentob
– that’s Y-E-N-T-O-B.
Q10
MAN: Right, I’ve got that. Thank you very much for all your help.
WOMAN: You’re very welcome. I hope you enjoy your trips.

剑桥雅思4 test 4 Section 2听力原文与答案
该部分前5道选择题的难度比较正常，出题方式和套路都比较符合目前考试的情况，但后5道填空题则过于简单了一些。10道题目中的易错点主要有两个：第15题的听力原文说的太有迷惑性，不少同学都会忽视every night前面的nearly，进而选错答案。而第17题nearest station中nearest的尾音读的太弱，很容易写成near station。

剑桥雅思15 test1 part1
雅思听力
原文
AMBER:
Hello William. This is Amber – you said to phone if I wanted to get more information about the job agency you mentioned. Is now a good time?
WILLIAM:
Oh. hi Amber. Yes. Fine. So the agency I was talking about is called Bankside – they’re based in Docklands -I can tell you the address now -497 Eastside
AMBER:
OK. thanks. So is there anyone in particular I should speak to there?
WILLIAM:
The agent I always deal with is called Becky Jamieson.
AMBER:
Let me write that down —Becky….
WILLIAM:
Jamieson J-A-M-L-E-S-O-N (Q1)
.
AMBER:
Do you have her direct line?
WILLIAM:
Yes, it’s in my contacts somewhere -right, here we are: 078 double 6, 510 triple 3. I wouldn’t call her until the
afternoon (Q2)
if I were you – she’s always really busy in the morning trying to fill last-minute vacancies. She’s really helpful and friendly so I’m sure it would be worth getting in touch with her for an informal chat.
AMBER:
It’s mainly clerical and admin jobs they deal with, isn’t it?
WILLIAM:
That’s right. I know you’re hoping to find a full-time job in the media eventually. but Becky mostly recruits temporary staff for the finance sector – which will look good on your CV – and generally pays better too
AMBER:
Yeah – I’m just a bit worried because I don’t have much office experience.
WILLIAM:
I wouldn’t worry. They’ll probably start you as a receptionist, or something like that. So what’s important for that kind of job isn’t so much having business skills or knowing lots of different computer systems – it’s
communication (Q3)
that really matters – so you’d be fine there. And you’ll pick up office skills really quickly on the job. It’s not that complicated
AMBER:
OK good. So how long do people generally need temporary staff for? It would be great if l could get something lasting at least a month
WILLIAM:
That shouldn’t be too difficult. But you’re more likely to be offered something for a
week (Q4)
at first, which might get extended. It’s unusual to be sent somewhere for just a day or two.
AMBER:
Right. I’ve heard the pay isn’t too bad – better than working in a shop or a restaurant.
WILLIAM:
Oh yes – definitely. The hourly rate is about
£10 (Q5)
, 11 if you’re lucky.
AMBER:
That’s pretty good. I was only expecting to get eight or nine pounds an hour.
WILLIAM:
Do you want me to tell you anything about the registration process?
AMBER:
Yes. please. I know you have to have an interview.
WILLIAM:
The interview usually takes about an hour and you should arrange that about a week in advance
AMBER:
I suppose I should dress smartly if it’s for office work – I can probably borrow a
suit (Q6)
from Mum.
WILLIAM:
Good idea, It’s better to look too smart than too casual
AMBER:
Will I need to bring copies of my exam certificates or anything like that?
WILLIAM:
No – they don’t need to see those, I don’t think.
AMBER:
What about my
passport (Q7)
?
WILLIAM:
Oh yes – they will ask to see that.
AMBER:
ОK.
WILLIAM:
I wouldn’t get stressed about the interview though. It’s just a chance for them to build a relationship with you – so they can try and match you to a job which you’ll like.So there are questions about
personality (Q8)
that they always ask candidates fairly basic ones. And they probably won’t ask anything too difficult like what your plans are for the future
AMBER:
Hope not
WILLIAM:
Anyway, there are lots of benefits to using an agency – for example, the interview will be useful because they’ll give you
feedback (Q9)
on your performance so you can improve next time.
AMBER:
And they’ll have access to jobs which aren’t advertised.
WILLIAM:
Exactly – most temporary jobs aren’t advertised.
AMBER:
And I expect finding a temporary job this way takes a lot less
time (Q10)
– it’s much easier than ringing up individual companies.
WILLIAM:
Yes indeed. Well I think …

原文
JIM:
Hello, South City Cycling Club.
WOMAN:
Oh, hi. Er… I want to find out about joining the club.
JIM:
Right. I can help you there. I’m the club secretary and my name’s Jim Hunter.
WOMAN:
Oh, hi Jim.
JIM:
So, are you interested in membership for yourself?
WOMAN:
That’s right.
JIM:
OK. Well there are basically two types of adult membership. If you’re pretty serious about cycling, there’s the Full membership. That costs 260 dollars and that covers you not just for ordinary cycling but also for
races (Q1)
both here in the city and also in other parts of Australia.
WOMAN:
Right. Well, I’m not really up to that standard. I was more interested in just joining a group to do some cycling in my free time.
JIM:
Sure. That’s why most people join. So, in that case you’d be better with the Recreational membership. That’s 108 dollars if you’re over 19, and 95 dollars if you’re under.
WOMAN:
I’m 25.
JIM:
OK. It’s paid quarterly, and you can upgrade it later to the Full membership if you want to, of course. Now both types of membership include the club fee of 20 dollars. They also provide
insurance (Q2)
in case you have an accident, though we hope you won’t need that, of course.
WOMAN:
No. OK, well, I’ll go with the Recreational membership, I think. And that allows me to join in the club activities, and so on?
JIM:
That’s right. And once you’re a member of the club, you’re also permitted to wear our kit when you’re out cycling. It’s green and white.
WOMAN:
Yes, I’ve seen cyclists wearing it. So, can I buy that at the club?
JIM:
No, it’s made to order by a company in Brisbane. You can find them online: they’re called
Jerriz. That’s J-E-R-R-l-Z (Q3)
. You can use your membership number to put in an order on their website.
WOMAN:
OK. Now, can you tell me a bit about the rides I can do?
JIM:
Sure. So we have training rides pretty well every morning, and they’re a really good way of improving your cycling skills as well as your general level of fitness, but they’re different levels. Level A is pretty fast – you’re looking at about 30 or 35 kilometres an hour. If you can do about
25 (Q4)
kilometres an hour, you’d probably be level B, and then level C are the novices, who stay at about 15 kilometres per hour.
WOMAN:
Right. Well I reckon I’d be level B. So, when are the sessions for that level?
JIM:
There are a couple each week. They’re both early morning sessions. There’s one on Tuesdays, and for that one you meet at 5.30 am. and the meeting point’s the
stadium (Q5)
– do you know where that is?
WOMAN:
Yes, it’s quite near my home, in fact. OK, and how about the other one?
JIM:
That’s on Thursdays. It starts at the same time, but they meet at the main gate to the
park (Q6)
.
WOMAN:
Is that the one just past the shopping mall?
JIM:
That’s it.
WOMAN:
So how long are the rides?
JIM:
They’re about an hour and a half. So, if you have a job it’s easy to fit in before you go to work. And the members often ao somewhere for
coffee (Q7)
afterwards, so it’s quite a social event.
WOMAN:
OK. That sounds good. I’ve only just moved to the city so I don’t actually know many people yet.
JIM:
Well, it’s a great way to meet people.
WOMAN:
And does each ride have a
leader (Q8)
?
JIM:
Sometimes, but not always. But you don’t really need one; the group members on the ride support one another, anyway.
WOMAN:
How would we know where to go?
JIM:
If you check the club website, you’ll see that the
route
(Q9)
for each ride is clearly marked. So you can just print that out and take it along with you. It’s similar from one week to another, but it’s not always exactly the same.
WOMAN:
And what do I need to bring?
JIM:
Well, bring a bottle of water, and your phone. You shouldn’t use it while you’re cycling, but have it with you.
WOMAN:
Right.
JIM:
And in winter, it’s well before sunrise when we set out, so you need to make sure your bike’s got
lights (Q10)
.
WOMAN:
That’s OK. Well, thanks Jim. I’d definitely like to join. So what’s the best way of going about it?
JIM: You can …

EMPLOYEE:
Hello, Picturerep. Can I help you?
WOMAN:
Oh, hi. I saw your advertisement about copying pictures to disk and I’d like a bit more information about what you do.
EMPLOYEE:
Sure. What would you like to know?
WOMAN:
Well, I’ve got a box full of old family photos that’s been up in the attic for years some of them must be 50 or 60 years old, and I’d like to get them converted to digital format.
EMPLOYEE:
Sure, we can do that for you
WOMAN:
Right. And what about size? The photos are all sorts of sizes – are there any restrictions?
EMPLOYEE:
Well the maximum size of photo we can do with our normal service is 30 centimetres. And each picture must be at least 4 centimetres. that’s the minimum we can cope with.
WOMAN:
That should be fine. And some of them are in a
frame (Q1)
– should I take them out before I send them?
EMPLOYEE:
Yes please, we can’t copy them otherwise. And also the photos must all be separate, they mustn’t be stuck into an album.
WOMAN:
OK, that’s not a problem. So can you give me an idea of how much this will cost? I’ve got about 360 photos I think
EMPLOYEE:
We charge £
195 (Q2)
for 300 to 400 photos for the basic service.
WOMAN:
OK. And does that include the disk?
EMPLOYEE:
Yes, one disk – but you can get extra ones for £5 each
WOMAN:
That’s good. So do l need to pay when I send you the photos?
EMPLOYEE:
No, we won’t need anything until we’ve actually copied the pictures. Then we’ll let you know how much it is. and once we’ve received the
payment (Q3)
, we’ll send the parcel off to you.
WOMAN:
Right.
EMPLOYEE:
Is there anything else you’d like to ask about our services?
WOMAN:
Yes. I’ve roughly sorted out the photos into groups, according to what they’re about – so can you keep them in those groups when you copy them?
EMPLOYEE:
Sure. We’ll save each group in a different folder on the disk and if you like, you can suggest a name for each folder
WOMAN:
So I could have one called
‘Grandparents’ (Q4)
for instance?
EMPLOYEE:
Exactly.
WOMAN:
And do you do anything besides scan the photos? Like, can you make any improvements?
EMPLOYEE:
Yes in the standard service each photo is checked, and we can sometimes touch up the
colour (Q5)
a bit, or improve the contrast – that can make a big difference
WOMAN:
OK. And some of the photos are actually quite fragile – they won’t get damaged in the process, will they?
EMPLOYEE:
No, if any look particularly fragile, we’d do them by
hand (Q6)
. We do realise how precious these old photos can be.
WOMAN:
Sure
EMPLOYEE:
And another thing is we can make changes to a photo if you want- so if you want to remove an object from a photo, or maybe alter the
background (Q7)
, we can do that.
WOMAN:
Really? I might be interested in that. I’ll have a look through the photos and see. Oh. and talking of fixing photos-I’ve got a few that aren’t properly in
focus (Q8)
. Can you do anything to make that better?
EMPLOYEE:
No. I’m afraid that’s one thing we can’t do.
WOMAN:
ОК.
EMPLOYEE:
Any other information I can give you?
WOMAN:
Er… oh, how long will it all take?
EMPLOYEE:
We aim to get the copying done in
ten days (Q9)
WOMAN:
Fine, Right, well I’ll get the photos packed up in a box and post them off to you.
EMPLOYEE:
Right. If you’ve got a strong cardboard box, that’s best. We’ve found that
plastic (Q10)
ones sometimes break in the post.

OK. Right, thanks for your help. Bye.

原文
SUSIE:
So Luke, for our next psychology assignment we have to do something on sleep and dreams.
LUKE:
Right. I’ve just read an article suggesting why we tend to forget most of our dreams soon after we wake up. I mean, most of my dreams aren’t that interesting anyway, but what it said was that if we remembered everything,
we might get mixed up about what actually happened and what we dreamed (Q21)
. So it’s a sort of protection. I hadn’t heard that idea before. I’d always assumed that it was just that we didn’t have room in our memories for all that stuff.
SUSIE:
Me too. What do you think about the idea that our dreams may predict the future?
LUKE:
It’s a belief that you get all over the world.
SUSIE:
Yeah, lots of people have a story of it happening to them, but the explanation I’ve read is that
for each dream that comes true, we have thousands that don’t (Q22)
, but we don’t notice those, we don’t even remember them. We just remember the ones where something in the real world, like a view or an action, happens to trigger a dream memory.
LUKE:
Right. So
it’s just a coincidence really (Q22)
. Something else I read about is what they call segmented sleeping. That’s a theory that hundreds of years ago, people used to get up in the middle of the night and have a chat or something to eat, then go back to bed. So I tried it myself.
SUSIE:
Why?
LUKE:
Well it’s meant to make you more creative. I don’t know why. But l gave it up after a week. It just didn’t fit in with my lifestyle.
SUSIE:
But most pre-school children have a short sleep in the day don’t they? There was an experiment some students did here last term to see at what age kids should stop having naps.
But they didn’t really find an answer
. They spent a lot of time working out the most appropriate methodology, but
the results didn’t seem to show any obvious patterns (Q23)
.
LUKE:
Right. Anyway, let’s think about our assignment. Last time I had problems with the final stage, where we had to describe and justify how successful we thought we’d been. I struggled a bit with the action plan too.
SUSIE:
I was OK with the planning, but
I got marked down for the self-assessment as well
(Q24)
. And I had big problems with the statistical stuff, that’s where I really lost marks
LUKE:
Right
SUSIE:
So shall we plan what we have to do for this assignment?
LUKE:
ОК
SUSIE:
First, we have to decide on our research question. So how about ‘Is there a relationship between hours of sleep and number of dreams?
LUKE:
OK. Then we need to think about who we’ll do the study on. About 12 people?
SUSIE:
Right. And shall we use other psychology students?
LUKE:
Let’s use people from a different department. What about
history
(Q25)
?
SUSIE:
Yes
. They might have interesting dreams! Or literature students?
LUKE:
I don’t really know any
SUSIE:
OK, forget that idea. Then we have to think about our methodology. So we could use observation, but that doesn’t seem appropriate.
LUKE:
No. It needs to be self-reporting I think. And we could ask them to answer questions online.
SUSIE:
But in this case,
paper
(Q26)
might be better
as they’ll be doing it straight after they wake up … in fact while they’re still half-asleep.
LUKE:
Right. And we’ll have to
check the ethical guidelines
for this sort of research.
SUSIE:
Mm, because our experiment involves
humans (Q27)
, so there are special regulations.
LUKE:
Yes, I had a look at those for another assignment I did. There’s a whole section on risk assessment, and another section on
making sure they aren’t put under any unnecessary
stress (Q28)
.
SUSIE:
Let’s hope they don’t have any bad dreams!
LUKE:
Yeah
SUSIE:
Then when we’ve collected all our data we have to analyse it and calculate the correlation between our two variables, that’s time sleeping and number of dreams and then
present our results visually in a
graph (Q29)
.
LUKE:
Right. And the final thing is to think about
our research and
evaluate
(Q30)
. So that seems quite straightforward
SUSIE:
Yeah. So now let’s …

剑桥雅思17 Test4 Part2

原文
As many of you here today have worked in the hotel industry for some time, I’m sure you have experienced the problem of high staff turnover in your hotels. Every hotel relies on having loyal and experienced members of staff who make sure that everything runs smoothly. If staff are constantly changing, it can make life difficult for everyone. But why do staff leave frequently in many hotels? Of course, many hotel jobs, such as cleaning, are low-skilled and are not well-paid. A lot of managers think it’s this and the long hours that are the main causes of high staff turnover – but what they don’t realise is that
it’s the lack of training in many hotel
jobs which is a huge factor (Q11)
.
So, what kind of problems does a high turnover of staff cause? Well,
having to recruit new staff all the time can be very time-consuming, and managers may have to cover some duties while waiting for new staff to arrive (Q12)
. This means they don’t have time to think about less immediate problems such as how to improve their service. When staff leave, it can also severely affect the colleagues they leave behind. It has a negative effect on remaining staff, who may start to feel that they too should be thinking about leaving.
So, what can be done to change this situation? Firstly, managers should stop making basic errors which leave their staff feeling upset and resentful. When organising shifts, for example,
make sure you never give certain staff preferential treatment. All staff should be given some choice about when they work (Q13)
, and everyone should have to work some evening and weekend shifts. If you treat staff fairly, they’ll be more likely to step in and help when extra staff are needed.
Keeping staff happy has other tangible benefits for the business. Take the Dunwich Hotel as an example. It had been experiencing a problem with staff complaints and in order to deal with this, invested in staff training and improved staff conditions. Not only did the level of complaints fall, but
they also noticed a significant increase in the amount each customer spent during their stay (Q14)
. They have now introduced a customer loyalty scheme which is going really well.
Now I’d like to look at some ways you can reduce staff turnover in your hotels, and I’ll do this by giving some examples of hotels where I’ve done some training recently.
The Sun Club received feedback which showed that staff thought managers didn’t value their opinions.
They weren’t made to feel they were partners who were contributing to the success of the business as a whole. This situation has changed. Junior staff at all levels are regularly invited to meetings where their ideas are welcomed (Q15)
.
A year ago, The Portland recognised the need to invest in staff retention. Their first step was to introduce a scheme for recognising talent amongst their employees.
The hope is that organising training for individuals with management potential (Q16)
will encourage them to stay with the business.
At Bluewater, managers decided to recognise 50 high achievers from across the company’s huge hotel chain.
As a reward, they’re sent on an all-expenses-paid trip abroad every year (Q17)
. Fun is an important element in the trips, but there’s also the opportunity to learn something useful. This year’s trip included a visit to a brewery, where staff learned about the new beer that would be served in the hotel.
Pentlow Hotels identified that retention of junior reception staff was an issue.
In order to encourage them to see that working in a hotel could be worthwhile and rewarding, with good prospects, they introduced a management programme (Q18)
. These staff were given additional responsibilities and the chance to work in various roles in the hotel.
Green Planet wanted to be seen as a caring employer. To make life easier for staff, many of whom had childcare responsibilities,
the hotel began issuing vouchers to help cover the cost of childcare (Q19)
.
Louise Marsh at The Amesbury has one of the best staff retention rates in the business. Since she joined the company, she has made a huge effort to achieve this
by creating a co-operative and supportive environment. For her, the staff are part of a large family where everyone is valued (Q20)
.
OK, now I’d like to …

剑桥雅思11 test4 section2
雅思听力
原文
Good morning, and welcome to the museum – one with a
remarkable
range of exhibits, which I’m sure you’ll enjoy.
My name’s Greg, and I’ll tell you about the various collections as we go round.
But before we go, let me just give you a taste of what we have here.
Well, for one thing, we have a fine collection of twentieth and twenty-first century paintings, many by very well-known artists.
I’m sure you’ll recognise several of the paintings.
This is the gallery that attracts the largest number of visitors (Q11)
, so it’s best to go in early in the day, before the crowds arrive.
Then there are the nineteenth-century paintings.
The museum was opened in the middle of that century, and
several of the artists each donated one work (Q12)
– to get the museum started, as it were.
So they’re of special interest to us – we feel closer to them than to other works.
The
sculpture
gallery has a number of fine exhibits, but I’m afraid it’s currently closed for
refurbishment
.
You’ll need to come back next year to see it properly, but
a number of the sculptures have been moved to other parts of the museum (Q13)
.
‘Around the world’ is a temporary exhibition – you’ve probably seen something about it on TV or in the newspapers (Q14)
.
It’s created a great deal of interest, because  it presents objects from every continent and many countries, and provides information about their social context – why they were made, who for, and so on.
Then there’s the collection of coins.
This is what you might call a focused, specialist collection, because all the coins come from this country, and were produced between two thousand and a thousand years ago.
And many of them were discovered by ordinary people digging their gardens, and donated to the museum (Q15)
!
All our
porcelain
and glass was left to the museum by its founder (Q16)
, when he died in 1878.
And in the terms of his will, we’re not allowed to add anything to that collection: he believed it was perfect in itself, and we don’t see any reason to disagree!
OK, that was something about the collections, and now here’s some more practical information, in case you need it.
Most of the museum facilities are downstairs, in the basement, so you go down the stairs here.
When you reach the bottom of the stairs, you’ll find yourself in a sitting area, with comfortable chairs and sofas where you can have a rest before continuing your exploration of the museum.
We have a very good restaurant, which serves excellent food all day, in a relaxing atmosphere.
To reach it, when you get to the bottom of the stairs, go straight ahead to the far side of the sitting area, then turn right into the
corridor
.
You’ll see the door of the restaurant facing you (Q17)
.
If you just want a snack, or if you’d like to eat somewhere with facilities for children, we also have a café.
When you reach the bottom of the stairs, you’ll need to go straight ahead, turn right into the
corridor
, and the café is immediately on the right (Q18)
.
And talking about children,
there are baby-changing facilities downstairs: cross the sitting area, continue straight ahead along the
corridor
on the left, and you and your baby will find the facilities on the left-hand side (Q19)
.
The
cloakroom
, where you should leave coats, umbrellas and any large bags, is on the left hand side of the sitting area.
It’s through the last door before you come to the
corridor (Q20)
.
There are toilets on every floor, but in the basement they’re the first rooms on the left when you get down there.
OK, now if you’ve got anything to leave in the
cloakroom
, please do that now, and then we’ll start our tour.

剑桥雅思11 test1 section2
雅思听力
原文
Welcome to the Fiddy Working Heritage Farm.
This open-air museum gives you the experience of
agriculture
and rural life in the English countryside at the end of the nineteenth century.
So you’ll see a typical farm of that period, and like me, all the staff are dressed in clothes of that time.
I must give you some advice and safety tips before we go any further.
As it’s a working farm, please don’t frighten or injure the
animals (Q11)
.
We have a lot here, and many of them are breeds that are now quite rare.
And do stay at a safe distance from the
tools (Q12)
: some of them have sharp points which can be pretty dangerous, so please don’t touch them.
We don’t want any accidents, do we?
The ground is very uneven, and you might slip if you’re wearing sandals soI’m glad to see you’re all wearing
shoes (Q13)
– we always advise people to do that.
Now, children of all ages are very welcome here, and usually even very young children love the ducks and lambs, so do bring them along next time you come.
I don’t think any of you have brought
dogs (Q14)
with you, but in case you have.
I’m afraid they’ll have to stay in the car park, unless they’re guide dogs.
I’m sure you’ll understand that they could cause a lot of problems on a farm.
Now let me give you some idea of the layout of the farm.
The building where you bought your tickets is the New Barn, immediately to your right, and we’re now at the beginning of the main path to the farmland – and of course the car park is on your left.
The scarecrow you can see in the car park in the corner, beside the main path (Q15)
, is a traditional figure for keeping the birds away from crops, but our scarecrow is a
permanent
sculpture
.
It’s taller than a human being, so you can see it from quite a distance.
If you look ahead of you, you’ll see a
maze
.
It’s opposite the New Barn, beside the side path that branches off to the right just over there (Q16)
.
The
maze
is made out of hedges which are too tall for young children to see over them, but it’s quite small, so you can’t get lost in it!
Now,
can you see the bridge crossing the fish pool further up the main path?
If you want to go to the café, go towards the bridge and turn right just before it.
Walk along the side path and the café’s on the first bend you come to (Q17)
.
The building was originally the schoolhouse, and it’s well over a hundred years old.
As you may know, we run skills workshops here, where you can learn traditional crafts like woodwork and basket-making.
You can see examples of the work, and talk to someone about the courses, in the Black Barn.
If you take the side path to the right, here, just by the New Barn, you’ll come to the Black Barn just where the Path first bends (Q18)
.
Now I mustn’t forget to tell you about picnicking, as I can see some of you have brought your lunch with you.
You can picnic in the field, though do clear up behind you, of course.
Or if you’d prefer a covered picnic area, there’s one near the farmyard: just after you cross the bridge, there’s a covered picnic spot on the right (Q19)
.
And the last thing to mention is Fiddy House itself.
From here you can cross the bridge then walk along the footpath through the field to the left of the farmyard.
That goes to the house (Q20)
, and it’ll give you a lovely view of it.
It’s certainly worth a few photographs, but as it’s a private home, I’m afraid you can’t go inside.
Right.
Well, if you’re all ready, we’ll set off on our tour of the farm.

JEANNE:
Hi Thomas, how are you enjoying the course so far?
THOMAS:
Yeah, I think it’s good.
JEANNE:
Remind me – why did you decide to study sports science? Didn’t you want to be a professional athlete when you were at school?
THOMAS:
Yeah – that was my goal, and
all my classmates assumed I would achieve it; they
thought I was brilliant (Q21)
.
JEANNE:
That must have been a nice feeling.
THOMAS:
Mm, I thought I could win anything. There was no one who could run faster than me.
JEANNE:
Exactly – so what happened? Did your mum and dad want you to be more ‘academic’?
THOMAS:
Not at all. Perhaps they should have pushed me harder, though.
JEANNE:
What do you mean?
THOMAS:
I think I should have practised more (Q22)
.
JEANNE:
What makes you say that?
THOMAS:
Well, I went out to Kenya for a couple of weeks to train …
JEANNE:
Really! I didn’t know that.
THOMAS:
I was chosen to go there out of loads of kids and run with some of the top teenage athletes in the world. And … I was so calm about it.
I just kept thinking how fortunate I was. What a great chance this was (Q23)
! Everyone back home was so proud of me. But once we started competing, I very quickly realised I wasn’t good enough.
JEANNE:
That must have been a huge shock.
THOMAS:
I thought ‘this can’t be happening’ (Q24)
! I was used to winning.
JEANNE:
I’m sorry to hear that.
THOMAS:
It’s OK. I’m over it now and I think it’s much better to do a university course and this one has such a variety of sports-related areas. It’s going to be good.
JEANNE:
Oh, I agree – I chose it because of that.
THOMAS:
So Jeanne – have you thought of any ideas for the discussion session next week on technology and sport?
JEANNE:
We have to cover more than one sport, don’t we?
THOMAS:
Yeah.
JEANNE:
You know – we always think technology is about the future, but we could gather some ideas about past developments in sport.
THOMAS:
Look at early types of equipment perhaps?
Uh, I remember reading something about table tennis bats once – how they ended up being covered with pimpled rubber.
JEANNE:
Cos they were just wooden at first, I’d imagine.
THOMAS:
Yeah. In about the 1920s,
a factory was making rolls of the rubber in bulk for something like horse harnesses (Q25)
.
JEANNE:
Really!
THOMAS:
Yeah – and someone realised that it’d make a perfect covering for the wooden bats.
JEANNE:
So what about cricket – that’s had a few innovative changes. Maybe the pads they wear on their legs?
THOMAS:
I don’t think they’ve changed much but, I’m just looking on the internet … and it says that when the first cricket helmet came in, in 1978,
the Australian batsman who first wore it was booed and jeered by people watching because it was so ugly (Q26)
!
JEANNE:
Wow, players have to protect themselves from getting hurt! I mean everyone wears one now.
THOMAS:
Mm, unlike the cycle helmet.
JEANNE:
Well, unless you’re a professional, but you’re right, many ordinary bikers don’t wear a helmet.
THOMAS:
Hey, look at these pictures of original helmet designs. This one looks like an upside-down bowl!
JEANNE:
Yet, the woman’s laughing – she’s so proud to be wearing it!
THOMAS:
It says
serious cyclists ended up with wet hair from all the hard exercise (Q27)
.
JEANNE:
I guess that’s why they have large air vents in them now so that the skin can breathe more easily.
THOMAS:
OK, so we’ve done helmets. What about golf balls or better still golf clubs – they’ve changed a lot.
JEANNE:
Yeah – I remember my great grandfather telling me that
because a club was made entirely of wood, it would easily break and players had to get another (Q28)
.
THOMAS:
There’s no wood at all in them now, is there?
JEANNE:
No – they’re much more powerful.
THOMAS:
The same must be true of hockey sticks.
JEANNE:
I don’t think so because players still use wooden sticks today. What it does say here, though, is that
when the game started you had to produce a stick yourself (Q29)
.
THOMAS:
I guess they just weren’t being manufactured. So, one more perhaps. What about football?
JEANNE:
Well, I know the first balls were made of animal skin.
THOMAS:
Yeah, they covered them with pieces of leather that were stitched together, but … the balls let in water when it rained.
JEANNE:
Oh, that would have made them much heavier.
THOMAS:
That’s right. You can imagine
the damage to players’ necks when the ball was headed (Q30)
.
JEANNE:
How painful that must have been!
THOMAS:
Yeah, well, I think we can put together some useful ideas …

剑5 test 1 Section 4
雅思听力
原文
OK, so we’ve been looking at the attitudes of various social and cultural groups towards the management of their personal finances – how important they feel it is to save money, and what they save their money for. One aspect that we haven’t yet considered is gender. So if we consider gender issues we’re basically asking whether men and women have different attitudes towards saving money, and whether they save money for different things.
Back in 1928 the British writer George Bernard Shaw wrote in his Intelligent Women’s Guide to Socialism and Capitalism that ‘A man is supposed to understand
politics
, economics, and finance and is, therefore, unwilling to accept essential instruction.’ He also said, ‘A woman, having fewer pretensions, is far more willing to
learn
’. Now, though these days people might question a lot of the assumptions contained in those statements, recent research does suggest that there are some quite fundamental differences between men and women in their attitudes to economic matters.
Q31, Q32
Let’s look at what men and women actually save for. Research studies of women in North America have found that women are far more likely to save for
their children’s education
and they are also more likely to save up in order to buy a house one day. The same studies have found that men, on the other hand, tend to save for
a car
, which by the way takes a surprisingly large amount of the household budget in North America. But the other main priority for men when saving money is their retirement. When they’re earning, they’re far more likely to put money aside for their old age than women are.
Q33, Q34
Now, this is rather disturbing because in fact, the need for women to save for their old age is far greater than for men. Let’s consider this for a moment. To start with, it is a fact that throughout the world, women are likely to live many years longer than men, so they need money to support them during this time. Since women are likely to be the ones left without a partner in old age, they may, therefore, have to pay for
nursing care
, because they don’t have a spouse to look after them. Furthermore, the high divorce rates in North America are creating a poverty cycle for women. It is the divorced women who will most often have to look after the children and thus they need more money to look after not just themselves but others.
Q35
So what can be done about this situation? The population in North America is likely to contain an increasing number of elderly women. The research indicates that at present for women it takes a
crisis
to make them think about their future financial situation.    Q36
But of course, this is the very worst time for anyone to make important decisions. Women today need to look ahead, think ahead – not wait until they’re under pressure. Even women in their
early twenties
need to think about pensions, for example, and with increasing numbers of women in professional positions, there are signs that this is beginning to happen. Then research also suggests that women avoid dealing effectively with their economic situation because of a lack of
confidence
. The best way for them to overcome this is by getting themselves properly informed so they are less dependent on other people’s advice. A number of initiatives have been set up to help them do this. This College, for example, is one of the educational institutions which offers night classes in
Money Management
, and increasing numbers of women are enrolling in such courses. Here, they can be given advice on different ways of saving. Many women are unwilling to invest in stocks and shares, for instance, but these can be extremely profitable. It is usually advised that at least 70% of a person’s savings should be in
low-risk investments
but for the rest, financial advisors often advise taking some well-informed risks. Initiatives such as this can give women the economic skills and knowledge they need for a comfortable, independent retirement.
Q37, Q38, Q39, Q40
The increasing proportion of elderly women in the population is likely to have other economic consequences …

CATHY:
OK, Graham, so let’s check we both know what we’re supposed to be doing.
GRAHAM:
OK
CATHY:
So, for the university’s open day, we have to plan a display on British life and literature in the mid-19th century.
GRAHAM:
That’s right. But we’ll have some people to help us find the materials and set it up,remember-for the moment, we just need to plan it.
CATHY:
Good. So have you gathered who’s expected to come and see the display? Is it for the people studying English, or students from other departments? I’m not clear about lL.
GRAHAM:
Nor me. That was how it used to be, but it didn’t attract many people, so this year it’s going to be part of an open day, to raise the university’s profile.
It’ll be publicised in the city, to encourage people to come and find out something of what goes on here (Q21)
. And it’s included in the information that’s sent to
people who are considering applying to study here next year (Q22)
.
CATHY:
Presumably some current students and lecturers will come?
GRAHAM:
I would imagine so, but we’ve been told to concentrate on the other categories of people.
CATHY:
Right. We don’t have ta cover the whole range of 19th-century literature, do we?
GRAHAM:
No, it’s entirely up to us. I suggest just using Charles Dickens.
CATHY:
That’s a good idea.
Most people have heard of him, and have probably read some of his novels, or seen films based on them (Q23)
, so that’s a good lead-in to life in his time.
GRAHAM:
Exactly.
And his novels show the awful conditions that most people had to live in. don’t they: he wanted to shock people into doing something about it (Q24)
.
CATHY:
Did he do any campaigning, other than writing?
GRAHAM:
Yes, he campaigned for education and other social reforms, and gave talks, but I’m inclined to ignore that and focus on the novels.
CATHY:
Yes, I agree.
CATHY:
OK, so now shall we think about a topic linked to each novel?
GRAHAM:
Yes. I’ve printed out a list of Dickens’s novels in the order they were published, in the hope you’d agree to focus on him!
CATHY:
You’re lucky I did agree! Let’s have a look.OK, the first was The Pickwick Papers, published in 1836. It was very successful when it came out, wasn’t it, and was adapted for the theatre straight away.
GRAHAM:
There’s an interesting point, though, that there’s
a character who keeps falling asleep, and that medical condition was named after the book-Pickwickian Syndrome (Q25)
.
CATHY:
Oh, so why don’t we use that as the topic, and include some quotations from the novel?
GRAHAM:
Right. Next is Oliver Twist. There’s a lot in the novel about poverty. But maybe something less obvious…
CATHY:
Well Oliver is taught how to steal, isn’t he? We could use that to illustrate the fact that
very few children went to school, particularly not poor children, so they learnt in other ways (Q26)
.
GRAHAM:
Good idea. What’s next?
CATHY:
Maybe Nicholas Nickleby. Actually, he taught in a really cruel school, didn’t he?
GRAHAM:
That’s right. But there’s also the
company of touring actors that Nicholas joins. We could do something on theatres and other amusements of the time (Q27)
. We don’t want only the bad things, do we?
CATHY:
OK.
GRAHAM:
What about Martin Chuzzlewit? He goes to the USA, doesn’t he?
CATHY:
Yes, and
Dickens himself had been there a year before and drew on his experience there in the novel (Q28)
.
GRAHAM:
I wonder, though … The main theme is selfishness, so we could do something on social justice? No, too general, let’s keep to your idea-I think it would work well.
CATHY:
He wrote Bleak House next – that’s my favourite of his novels.
GRAHAM:
Yes, mine too. His satire of the legal system is pretty powerful.
CATHY:
That’s true, but think about Esther,
the heroine. As a child she lives with someone she doesn’t know is her aunt. who treats her very badly. Then she’s very happy living with her guardian, and he puts her in charge of the household. And at the end she gets married and her guardian gives her and her husband a house. where of course they’re very happy (Q29)
.
GRAHAM:
Yes, I like that.
CATHY:
What shall we take next? Litle Domit? Old Mr Dorrit has been in a debtors’ prison for years…
GRAHAM:
So was Dickens’s father, wasn’t he?
CATHY:
That’s right.
GRAHAM:
What about focusing on
the part when Mr Dorrit inherits a fortune, and he starts pretending he’s always been rich (Q30)
?
CATHY:
Good idea.
GRAHAM:
OK, so next we need to think about what materials we want to illustrate each issue. That’s going to be quite hard.

that opened a few years ago – it’s attracted a lot of custom, and so the company has now decided to open another branch in the area. It’s going to be in the shopping centre to the
west
(Q12)
of Bradcaster, so that will be good news for all of you who’ve found the original shop in the north of the town hard to get to.
I was invited to a special preview and I can promise you, this is the ultimate in sports retailing. The whole place has been given a new minimalist look with the company’s signature colours of black and red. The first three floors have a huge range of sports
clothing (Q13)
as well as equipment, and on the top floor there’s a cafe and a book and DVD section. You’ll find all the well-known names as well as some less well- known ones. If they haven’t got exactly what you want in stock they promise to get it for you in
ten (Q14)
days. Unlike the other store, where it can take up to fourteen days. They cover all the major sports, including football, tennis and swimming, but they particularly focus on
running (Q15)
, and they claim to have the widest range of equipment in the country. As well as that, a whole section of the third floor is devoted to
sports bags (Q16)
, including the latest designs from the States – if you can’t find what you want here, it doesn’t exist!
The shop will be open from 9.00 am this Saturday and if you go along to the opening then you’ll have the chance to meet the national 400 metres running champion Paul King, who’s coming along to open the shop, and
he will be staying around until about midday (Q17)
to chat to any fans who want to meet him and sign autographs.
Then there will be a whole range of special attractions all weekend. There will be free tickets for local sporting events for the first 50 customers, and also a special competition open to all. Just answer fifteen out of twenty sports questions correctly to win a signed copy of Paul King’s DVD ‘Spring Tips’, while
the first person to get all the questions correct gets a year’s
free membership of the Bradcaster Gym (Q18)
. All entrants will receive a special Sports calendar with details of all Bradcaster fixtures in the coming year.
One of the special opening offers is a fitness test – a complete review of your cardiac fitness and muscle tone, actually done in the shop by qualified staff.
This would normally cost £30.00 but is available at half price for this month only (Q19). There are only a limited number of places available for this, so to make a booking (Q20)
phone 560341. In addition, if you open an account you get lots more special offers including the chance to try out equipment at special open evenings …

Good morning and welcome, everybody. I’m Jenny Stewart and I’m the Staff Manager here at the exhibition centre. We’re expecting this year’s International Travel Exhibition to attract over 10,000 visitors a day, ladies and gentlemen, and you are among the two hundred extra staff recruited to help look after them. Now, to help things run smoothly, we have divided you into four teams – the blue team, the green team, the red team, and the yellow team. So first I’ll explain how the teams are divided up, and then we’ll be giving you colour-coded T-shirts so we can identify you more easily. First of all, those who will be looking after the phones and handling all calls regarding the exhibition, you will be on the red team.  Now,
we’ve also put the entrance staff on the red team and you’ll be stamping the entrance tickets
and giving out publicity leaflets, OK?
Q11
Those of you involved in distributing entrance tickets will be on the yellow team and we’ve also put those of you who’ll be staffing the information booths around the conference centre on the yellow team, so you’ll be getting a yellow T-shirt. Now, most of the hospitality staff have been put in the blue team, so
the chefs among you and the kitchen hands will all need a blue T-shirt
, but, because of the sheer numbers, all waiting staff will be on the yellow team, and this includes the bar staff among you.
Those who will be monitoring and directing the traffic in the car parks are on the green team
, so you’ll need to get a green T-shirt. This year we’ve also employed a considerable number of attendants to direct the human traffic around the conference centre. Now, you’ll be working in the exhibition hall at all times, giving directions and generally helping people whenever you can, and you will be in the red team, so please collect a red T-shirt.
Q12    Q13
Right, now that everyone knows what team they’re in, we’ll get on with the orientation and training programme and first I’ll run through the rest of today’s programme, which you should have in front of you, so that you can get a general idea of what else is in store today. This introduction finishes at 9.30 and then you’ll be hearing from Anne Smith. Anne works in the accounts department on level two and she looks after all temporary staff, and so she is the person to see if you have any problems regarding pay. Anne will be explaining when and how you get this. She will also be handing out your tax forms. And I will just stress that all
tax
forms must be completed and returned to Anne before your pay can be processed. Following Anne’s talk you’ll hear from Peter Chen, our Conference Manager, and he will be going over a plan of the conference centre with you, which will help you to orient yourselves. He will also go through the
security
arrangements with you and show you the fire exits. Then at 10.30, there will be a coffee break in the staff canteen, which is located down on the
ground floor
. Now, after the break we’ll be moving to a different location for a video presentation, so instead of coming back here, we’d like you all to go to
Lecture Room three-one-one
. You’ll find it on this same level, just down the hall, and there you will be shown a video about important safety issues in the workplace, called
Safety at Work
. We’ll finish off the morning with lunch, which should give everyone a chance to meet and get to know each other, and we’ll be serving you a buffet lunch in the
Main Hall
, which is on the first floor, from 12.00 o’clock. After lunch you’ll be divided up into your teams to meet your
team leaders
and we’re hoping to be all finished by 3.00 so I won’t delay you any longer, and I’ll hand over to…

剑桥雅思12 test8 section4
雅思听力
原文
This lecture will be about the science of acoustics, the study of sound, in relation to urban environments such as cities.
As an
acoustic
engineer myself, I think this is an area where we’re likely to see great changes.
In the past, researching urban soundscapes was simple.
We measured levels of sound in decibels, so I used to take my sound meter and I measured the noise somewhere, and then I might ask a sample of people to say at what level the sound became
annoying
.
With data like this,
acoustic
engineers have been able to build up what we call noise maps, maps of the sound environment.
But actually these aren’t a lot of use.
What they do show is that the highest noise levels are generally on roads — well, that’s not really very surprising.
But there’s quite a lot going on that these maps don’t show, because they can’t capture the complex way that sound varies over time.
So they ignore important issues such as the noise someone might hear from the open windows or
gardens (Q31)
of their neighbours, and this sort of noise can be quite significant in summer.
We don’t have any databases on this sort of information.
As well as that, these records of sound levels take no account of the fact that people vary in their perceptions of noise — so someone like me with years of working in acoustics might be very different from you in that regard.
But anyway, even though these noise maps are fairly
crude
, they’ve been useful in providing information and raising awareness that noise matters, we need to deal with it and so it’s a
political (Q32)
matter.
And that’s important – we need rules and regulations because noise can cause all sorts of problems.
Those of you who are city-dwellers know that things go on 24 hours a day, so city-dwellers often suffer from
interrupted
sleep.
It’s also known that noise can lead to a rise in levels of stress, due to physical changes in the body affecting the
composition
of the blood.
And there are other problems as well, for
instance
if schoolchildren don’t have a quiet place to
study
, their
work (Q33)
will suffer.
Now, one problem with decibel measurement is that it doesn’t
differentiate
between different types of noise.
Some types of sounds that most people would probably think of as nice and relaxing might well score quite highly in decibel levels – think of the sound made by a
fountain (Q34)
in a town square, for example.
That’s not necessarily something that we’d want to control or reduce.
So maybe researchers should consider these sorts of sounds in urban design.
This is going to be tricky because just measuring decibel levels isn’t going to help us here.
Instead, many researchers are using
social (Q35)
science techniques, studying people’s emotional response to sound by using questionnaires and so on.
So what exactly do people want to hear in an urban environment?
Some recent interdisciplinary research has come out with results that at first sight seem
contradictory
– a city needs to have a sense of activity so it needs to be
lively (Q36)
with sounds like the
clack
of high heels on a pavement or the hiss of a coffee machine, but these mustn’t be too
intrusive
, because at the same time we need to be able to relax.
One of the major problems in achieving this will be getting architects and town planners to use the research.
Apart from studying the basics of acoustics, these people receive very little
training (Q37)
in this area.
But in fact they should be regarding sound as an opportunity to add to the experience of urban living,
whereas
at present they tend to see it as something to be avoided or reduced as far as possible, or something that’s just a job for engineers like the street
drainage
system.
What’s needed is for noise in cities to be regarded as an
aesthetic
quality, as something that has the qualities of an art form.
If we acknowledge this, then we urgently need to know what governs it and how designers can work with it.
We need to develop a complex understanding of many factors.
What is the relationship between sound and
culture (Q38)
?
What can we learn from disciplines such as
psychology
about the way that sound interacts with human development and social relationships, and the way that sound affects our thought and feelings?
Can we learn anything from physics about the
nature (Q39)
of sound itself?
Today’s powerful technologies can also help us.
To show us their ideas and help us to imagine the effect their buildings will have, architects and town planners already use virtual reality – but these programs are
silent (Q40)
.
In the future such programs could use realistic sounds, meaning that soundscapes could be explored before being built.
So hopefully, using the best technology we can lay our hands on, the city of the future will be a pleasure to the ears as well as the eyes.

剑7 test 3 Section 3
雅思听力
原文
SIMON: Thanks to all of you for coming along today to hear about how the robotic float project is helping with ocean research. Well, first of all, we’ll look at what a robotic float does and its use. So let’s start with the device itself. It looks a bit like a
cigar
and it’s about one and a half meters long. More importantly, it’s full of equipment that’s designed to collect data. So, it can help us in building up a profile of different factors which work together within the world’s oceans.
Q21
STUDENT I: Sounds like a big project – isn’t it too big for one country to undertake?
SIMON: That’s quite true but this project is a really good example of international co-operation. Over the last five years scientists from
thirteen countries
have been taking part in the project and launching floats in their area of ocean control. And next year this number will rise to fourteen when Indonesia joins the project.
Q22
STUDENT 2: That’s impressive.
SIMON: But let’s move onto how floats work.
SIMON: The operational cycle goes like this. Each of the floats is dropped in the ocean from a boat at a set point and
activated
from a satellite. Then the float immediately sinks about 2,000 meters… that’s two whole kilometers down in the water. It stays at this depth for about 10days and is carried around by the currents which operate in the ocean at this level. During this time it’s possible for it to cover quite large distances but the average is
fifty kilometers
.
Q23 Q24
STUDENT 2: So what is it actually recording?
SIMON: Well at this stage nothing, but as it rises to the surface it collects all sorts of data, most importantly variations in salinity, that’s salt levels, and the changes in
temperature
, a bit like underwater weather balloons. Then when it gets back to the surface all the data it’s collected is beamed up to the satellite. After about five hours on the surface, the float automatically sinks, beginning the whole process again.
Q25
STUDENT I: What happens to the data?
SIMON: Well the information is transferred direct to onshore meteorological stations… like our one in Hobart… and within four hours the findings can be on computers and they can be mapped and analysed.
STUDENT 2: You say you’re building models of the world’s ocean systems but how’re they going to be used, and more importantly, when?
SIMON:
Some of the data has already helped in completing projects. For example, our understanding of the underlying causes of El Niño
events is being confirmed by float data. Another way we’re using float data is to help us to
understand the mechanics of climate change, like global warming and ozone depletion. That’s part of an ongoing variability study but the results are still a long way off
.
Q26 Q27
However, this is not the case with our ocean weather forecasting. Because we know from the floats what the prevailing weather conditions will be in certain parts of the ocean, we can advise the navy
on search and rescue missions. That’s happening right now
and many yachtsmen owe their lives to the success of this project. In addition, the float data can help us to look at the biological implications of ocean processes.
Q28
STUDENT 1 : Would that help
with preserving fish stocks
?
Q29
SIMON: Yes, and advising governments on fisheries legislation. We’re well on the way to completing a project on this. We hope it will help to bring about more
sustainable fishing practices. We’ll be seeing the results of that quite soon
.
STUDENT 2: It sounds like the data from floats has lots of applications.
SIMON: Yes it does. It’s also a powerful agricultural tool. If we were aware of what the weather would be like, say, next year, we could make sure that the farmers planted appropriate grain varieties to produce the best yield from the available rainfall. STUDENT I: That sounds a bit like science fiction, especially when now we can’t even tell them when a drought will break.
SIMON: I agree that this concept
is still a long way in the future
, but it will come eventually and the float data will have made a contribution.

剑桥雅思18Test1Part2听力答案解析 Becoming a volunteer for ACE
剑桥雅思18 Test1 Part2
雅思听力
原文
Good evening, everyone. Let me start by welcoming you all to this talk and thanking you for taking the time to consider joining ACE voluntary organization. ACE offers support to people and services in the local area and we’re now looking for more volunteers to help us do this.
By the way, I hope you’re all comfortable –
we have brought in extra seats so that no one has to stand, but it does mean that the people at the back of the room may be a bit squashed (Q11)
. We’ll only be here for about half an hour so, hopefully, that’s OK.
One of the first questions we’re often asked is how old you need to be to volunteer. Well, you can be as young as 16 or you can be 60 or over; it all depends on what type of voluntary work you want to do.
Other considerations, such as reliability, are crucial in voluntary work and age isn’t related to these, in our experience (Q12)
.
Another question we get asked relates to training. Well, there’s plenty of that and it’s all face-to-face. What’s more,
training doesn’t end when you start working for us -it takes place before, during and after periods of work (Q13)
. Often, it’s run by other experienced volunteers as managers tend to prefer to get on with other things.
Now, I would ask you to consider a couple of important issues before you decide to apply for voluntary work. We don’t worry about why you want to be a volunteer – people have many different reasons that range from getting work experience to just doing something they’ve always wanted to do.
But it is critical that you have enough hours in the day (Q14)
for whatever role we agree is suitable for you – if being a volunteer becomes stressful then it’s best not to do it at all. You may think that your income is important, but we don’t ask about that. It’s up to you to decide if you can work without earning money.
What we value is dedication (Q15)
. Some of our most loyal volunteers earn very little themselves but still give their full energy to the work they do with us.
OK, so let’s take a look at some of the work areas that we need volunteers for and the sort of things that would help you in those.
You may wish simply to help us raise money.
If you have the creativity to come up with an imaginative or novel way of fundraising, we’d be delighted (Q16)
, as standing in the local streets or shops with a collection box can be rather boring!
One outdoor activity that we need volunteers for is litter collection and for this
it’s useful if you can walk for long periods, sometimes uphill (Q17)
. Some of our regular collectors are quite elderly, but very active and keen to protect the environment.
If you enjoy working with children, we have three vacancies for what are called ‘playmates’These volunteers help children learn about staying healthy through a range of out-of-school activities. You don’t need to have children yourself, but
it’s good if you know something about nutrition (Q18)
and can give clear instructions.
If that doesn’t appeal to you, maybe you would be interested in
helping out at our story club for disabled children. especially if you have done some acting (Q19)
. We put on three performances a year based on books they have read and we’re always looking for support with the theatrical side of this.
The last area I’ll mention today is first aid. Volunteers who join this group can end up teaching others in vulnerable groups who may be at risk of injury. Initially, though,
your priority will be to take in a lot of information and not forget any important steps or details (Q20)
.
Right, so does anyone have any questions …

SALLY:
Good morning.Thanks for coming in to see us here at the agency, Joe. I’m one of the agency representatives, and my name’s Sally Baker.
JOE:
Hi Sally. I think we spoke on the phone, didn’t we?
SALLY:
That’s right, we did. So thank you for sending in your CV. We’ve had quite a careful look at it and | think we have two jobs that might be suitable for you.
JOE:
OK.
SALLY:
The first one is in a company based in North London. They’re looking for an administrative assistant.
JOE:
OK. What sort of company is it?
SALLY:
They’re called Home Solutions and they design and make
furniture (Q1)
.
JOE:
Oh, I don’t know much about that, but it sounds interesting.
SALLY:
Yes, well as | said, they want someone in their office, and looking at your past experience it does look as if you fit quite a few of the requirements. So on your CV, it appears you’ve done some data entry?
JOE:
Yes.
SALLY:
So that’s one skill they want. Then they expect the person they appoint to attend
meetings (Q2)
and take notes there…
JOE:
OK. I’ve done that before, yes.
SALLY:
And you’d need to be able to cope with general admin.
JOE:
Filing, and keeping records and so on? That should be OK. And in my last job I also had to manage the
diary (Q3)
.
SALLY:
Excellent. That’s something they want here too. I’d suggest you add it to your CV – I don’t think you mentioned that, did you?
JOE:
No.
SALLY:
So as far as the requirements go, they want good computer skills, of course, and they particularly mention spreadsheets.
JOE:
That should be fine.
SALLY:
And interpersonal skills – which would be something they’d check with your references.
JOE:
I think that should be OK, yes.
SALLY:
Then they mention that they want someone who is careful and takes care with
details (Q4)
– just looking at your CV, I’d say you’re probably alright there.
JOE:
I think so, yes. Do they want any special experience?
SALLY:
I think they wanted some experience of teleconferencing.
JOE:
I’ve got three years’ experience of that.
SALLY:
Let’s see, yes, good. In fact, they’re only asking for
at least one year (Q5)
, so that’s great. So is that something that might interest you?
JOE:
It is, yes. The only thing is, you said they were in North London so it would be quite a long commute for me.
SALLY:
OK.
SALLY:
So the second position might suit you better as far as the location goes; that’s for a warehouse assistant and that’s in South London.
JOE:
Yes, that would be a lot closer.
SALLY:
And you’ve worked in a warehouse before, haven’t you?
JOE:
Yes.
SALLY:
So as far as the responsibilities for this position go, they want someone who can manage the stock, obviously, and also
deliveries (Q6)
.
JOE:
That should be OK. You’ve got to keep track of stuff, but I’ve always been quite good with numbers.
SALLY:
Good. That’s their first requirement. And they want someone who’s computer literate, which we know you are.
JOE:
Sure.
SALLY:
Then they mention organisational skills. They want someone who’s well organised.
JOE:
Yes, I think l am.
SALLY:
And
tidy (Q7)
?
JOE:
Yes, they go together really, don’t they?
SALLY:
Sure. Then the usual stuff; they want someone who can communicate well both orally and in writing.
JOE:
OK. And for the last warehouse job I had, one of the things | enjoyed most was being part of a
team (Q8)
. I found that was really essential for the job.
SALLY:
Excellent. Yes, they do mention that they want someone who’s used to that, yes. Now when you were working in a warehouse last time, what sorts of items were you dealing with?
JOE:
It was mostly bathroom and kitchen equipment, sinks and stoves and fridges.
SALLY:
So you’re OK moving
heavy (Q9)
things?
JOE:
Sure. I’m quite strong, and I’ve had the training.
SALLY:
Good. Now as far as experience goes, they mention they want someone with a licence, and that you have experience of driving in London so you can cope with the traffic and so on.
JOE:
Yes, no problem.
SALLY:
And you’ve got experience of warehouse work … and the final thing they mention is
customer (Q10)
service. I think looking at your CV you’re OK there.
JOE:
Right. So what about pay? Can you tell me a bit more about that, please …

JOHN: Erm… hello Professor, I’m John Wishart.
I’m working on my entry for the Global Design Competition.
My tutor said you might be able to help me with it.
PROFESSOR: Ah, yes. I got a copy of your drawings.
Come in and tell me about it.
What sort of competition is it?
JOHN: Well, It’s an international design competition and we have to come up with a new design for a typical domestic kitchen appliance.
PROFESSOR: I see, and are there any special conditions?
Does it have to save energy for example?
JOHN: Actually that was the focus in last year’s competition.
This year’s different.
We have to adopt an
innovative
approach to existing technology (Q21)
, using it in a way that hasn’t been thought of before.
PROFESSOR: I see, that sounds tricky.
And what kitchen appliance have you chosen?
JOHN: Well, I decided to choose the dishwasher.
PROFESSOR: Interesting, what made you choose that?
JOHN: Well, they’re an everyday kitchen appliance in most Australian houses but they’re all pretty boring and almost
identical
to each other.
I think some people will be prepared to pay a little extra for something that looks different (Q22)
.
PROFESSOR: That’s a nice idea.
I see you’ve called your design ‘the Rockpool’; why is that?
JOHN: Basically because it looks like the rock pools you find on a beach.
The top is made of glass so that you can look down into it.
PROFESSOR: And there’s a stone at the bottom.
Is that just for decoration?
JOHN: Actually it does have a function.
Instead of pushing a button, you turn the stone (Q23)
.
PROFESSOR: So it’s really just a novel way of starting the dishwasher.
JOHN: That’s right.
PROFESSOR: It’s a really nice design, but what makes it
innovative
?
JOHN: Well, I decided to make a dishwasher that uses
carbon
dioxide
.
PROFESSOR: In place of water and
detergent
?
How will you manage that?
JOHN: The idea is to pressurise the
carbon
dioxide
so that it becomes a liquid.
The
fluid
is then released into the dishwasher where it cleans the dishes all by itself.
PROFESSOR: Sounds like a brilliant idea!
Your system will totally do away with the need for strong detergents.
So what happens once the dishes are clean?
JOHN: Well, to allow them to dry, the liquid
carbon
dioxide
and the waste materials all go to an area called the holding
chamber
.
That’s where the liquid is depressurised and so it reverts to a gas (Q24)
.
Then the oil and
grease
are separated out and sent to the waste system.
PROFESSOR: It sounds like you’ve thought it all out very thoroughly.
So, what happens to the
carbon
dioxide
once the process is complete?
Not wasted I hope.
JOHN: Actually, that’s where the real savings are made.
The
carbon
dioxide
is sent back to the cylinder and can be used again and again (Q25)
.
PROFESSOR: What a terrific idea.
Do you think it will ever be built?
JOHN: Probably not, but that’s OK.
PROFESSOR: Well, I’m sure a lot of positive things will come out of your design.
PROFESSOR: Now, you seem to have thought about everything so what exactly did you need me to help you with?
JOHN: Well, my design has made it to the final stage of the competition and, in a few months’ time, I have to give a
presentation
(Q26)
, and that’s the part I was hoping you could help me with.
PROFESSOR: Right, well that should be easy enough.
What have you managed to do so far?
JOHN: Well, I’ve got detailed drawings to show how it will work and I’ve also written a 500-word paper on it.
PROFESSOR: I see. Well, if you want to stand a good chance of winning you really need a
model (Q27)
of the machine.
JOHN: Yes, I thought I might but I’m having a few problems.
PROFESSOR: What is the main difficulty so far?
Let me guess—is it the
materials (Q28)
?
JOHN: Yes, I want it to look professional but everything that’s top quality is also very expensive.
PROFESSOR: Look, projects like this are very important to us.
They really help lift our profile.
So why don’t you talk to the university about a
grant (Q29)
?
I can help you fill out the application forms if you like.
JOHN: That would be great.
PROFESSOR: You’d better show me this paper you’ve written as well.
For a global competition such as this you need to make sure the
technical
(Q30)
details you’ve given are accurate and thorough.
JOHN: That would be a great help.
PROFESSOR: Is there anything else I can do?
JOHN: Well, I’m really…

剑桥雅思8Test2听力Section3答案解析 Honey Bees in Australia
剑8 test 2 Section 3
雅思听力
原文
PROFESSOR:    Good morning everyone. In today’s seminar, Grant Freeman, a biologist who specialises in identifying insects, and who works for the Australian Quarantine Service, has come to talk to us about his current research work. Right, well, over to you, Grant.
GRANT:        Good morning, everyone. I’m sure that you know that the quarantine service regulates all food brought into Australia. Well, obviously they want to protect Australia from diseases that might come in with imported goods, but they also want to prevent insect pests from being introduced into the country, and that’s where I have a part to play. Anyway, my current research involves trying to find a particular type of bee, the Asian Honey Bee, and finding out whether there are any of them around in various states of Australia. We discovered a few of them in
Queensland
(
Q21
) once and eradicated them. Now, we’re pretty keen to make sure that there aren’t any more getting in, particularly to New South Wales and other states.
STUDENT 1:     What’s wrong with Asian Honey Bees? Are they so different from Australian bees?
GRANT:        Well, in fact, they look almost the same, but
they are infested with mites
(
Q22
) – microscopic creatures which live on them, and which can seriously damage our own home-grown bees, or could even wipe them out.
PROFESSOR:    Well, what would happen if Australian bees died out?
GRANT:        Well, the honey from Australian bees is of excellent quality, much better than the stuff the Asian bees produce. In fact,
Australia exports native Queen bees to a large number of countries because of this
(
Q23
). When the European Honey Bee was first discovered out in the bush, we found they made really unpleasant honey and they were also too big to pollinate many of our native flowers here in Australia.
STUDENT 2:     That must have had a devastating effect on the natural flora. Did you lose any species?
GRANT:        NO, we managed to get them under control before that happened but if Asian bees got in there could be other consequences.
We could lose a lot of money
(
Q24
) because you might not be aware, but it’s estimated that native bees’ pollination of flower and vegetable crops is worth 1. 2 billion dollars a year. So in a way they’re the farmers’ friend. Oh, and another thing is, if you’re stung by an Asian Honey Bee, it can produce an allergic reaction in some people; so they’re much more dangerous than native bees.
PROFESSOR:    HOW will you know if Asian bees have entered Australia?
GRANT:        We’re looking at the diet of the bird called the Rainbow Bee Eater. The Bee Eater doesn’t care what it eats, as long as they’re
insects
(
Q25
). But the interesting thing about this bird is that we are able to analyse—exactly what it eats and that’s really helpful if we’re looking for introduced insects.
PROFESSOR:    How come?
GRANT:        Because insects have their skeletons outside their bodies, so the Bee Eaters digest the meat from the inside. Then they bring up all the indigestible bits of skeleton and, of course, the wings in a pellet – a small ball of waste material which they cough up.
PROFESSOR:    That sounds a bit unpleasant. So, how do you go about it?
GRANT:        In the field We track down the Bee Eaters and find their favourite
feeding
(
Q26
) spots, you know, the places where the birds usually feed. It’s here that we can find the pellets. We collect them up and take them back to the
laboratory
(
Q27
) to examine the contents.
PROFESSOR:    HOW do you do that?
GRANT:        The pellets are really hard, especially if they have been out in the sun for a few days so, first of all, we treat them by adding
water
(
Q28
) to moisten them and make them softer. Then we pull them apart under the microscope. Everything’s all scrunched up but we’re looking for wings so we just pull them all out and straighten them. Then we identify them to see if we can find any Asian bee
wings
(
Q29
).
PROFESSOR:    And how many have you found?
GRANT:        So far our research shows that Asian bees have not entered Australia in any number- it’s a good result and much more
reliable
(
Q30
) than trying to find live ones as evidence of introduced insects.
PROFESSOR:    Well, that’s fascinating! Thank you, Grant, for those insights. I hope that you might inspire some of our students here to conduct some similar experiments.

原文
CAROL:            Good morning and welcome again to Your City Today. With me today is Graham Campbell, a councillor from the city council. He will be telling us about the plan to improve the fast-growing suburb of Red Hill. Good morning Graham and welcome to the show.
GRAHAM:       Good morning, Carol.
CAROL:            NOW, Graham, I understand that there has been a lot of community consultation for the new plan?
GRAHAM:       Yes, we’ve tried to address some of the concerns that local groups told us about. People we’ve heard from are mainly worried about traffic in the area, and, in particular, the increasing speed of cars near schools.
They feel that it is only a matter of time before there is an accident as a lot of the children walk to the school. So we’re trying to do something about that
(Q11)
.
Another area of concern is the overhead power lines. These are very old and a lot of people we spoke to asked if something could be done about them. Well, I’m happy to report that the power company have agreed
to move the power lines underground (Q12)
at a cost of $800, 000. I think that will really improve the look of the area, as well as being safer.
CAROL:            That’s good to know, but will that mean an increase in rates for the local businesses in that area?
GRAHAM:       Well,
the power company have agreed to bear the cost of this (Q13)
themselves after a lot of discussion with the council. This is wonderful news as the council now has some extra funds for us to put into other things like tree planting and art work.
GRAHAM:       NOW, we’ve also put together a map which we’ve sent out to all the residents in the area. And on the map we’ve marked the proposed changes. Firstly, we’ll plant mature pine trees to provide shelter and shade just
to the right of the supermarket in Days Road (Q14
)
. In order to address the traffic problems, the pavements
on the corner of Carberry and Thomas Street will be widened (Q15)
. This will help to reduce the speed of vehicles entering Thomas Street. We think it’s very important to separate the local residential streets from the main road.
So the roadway at the entry to Thomas Street from Days Road will be painted red (Q16)
. This should mark it more clearly and act as a signal for traffic to slow down. One way of making sure that the pedestrians are safe is to increase signage at the intersections. A ‘keep clear’ sign will be erected
at the junction of Evelyn Street and Hill Street (Q17)
, to enable traffic to exit at all times. Something we’re planning to do to help control the flow of traffic in the area is
to install traffic lights half way down Hill Street where it crosses Days Road (Q18)
. Now, we haven’t only thought about the cars and traffic, of course, there’s also something for the children. We’re going to get school children in the area to research a local story, the life of a local sports hero perhaps, and an artist will incorporate that story into paintings
on the wall of a building on the other side of Hill Street from the supermarket (Q19)
. And finally, we’ve agreed to build a new children’s playground which will be
at the other end of Hill Street close to the intersection with Carberry Street (Q20)
.
CAROL:            Wonderful, now, what’s the next stage?
GRAHAM:       Well, the final plan. . .

剑桥雅思15Test4Part4听力答案解析 How the industrial revolution affected life in Britain
剑桥雅思15 Test4 Part4
雅思听力
原文
Hi everyone, in this session I’ll be presenting my research about the social history of Britain during the Industrial Revolution. I particularly looked at how ordinary lives were affected by changes that happened at that time. This was a time that saw the beginning of a new phenomenon: consumerism -where buying and selling goods became a major part of ordinary people’s lives.
In fact, it was in the 19th century that the quantity and quality of people’s possessions was used as an indication of the
wealth (Q31)
of the country. Before this, the vast majority of people had very few possessions, but all that was changed by the Industrial Revolution. This was the era from the mid-18th to the late 19th century, when improvements in how goods were made as well as in
technology (Q32)
triggered massive social changes that transformed life for just about everybody in several key areas.
First let’s look at manufacturing. When it comes to manufacturing, we tend to think of the Industrial Revolution in images of steam engines and coal. And it’s true that the Industrial Revolution couldn’t have taken place at all if it weren’t for these new sources of
power (Q33)
. They marked an important shift away from the traditional watermills and windmills that had dominated before this. The most advanced industry for much of the 19th century was
textiles (Q34)
. This meant that fashionable fabrics, and lace and ribbons were made available to everyone
Before the Industrial Revolution, most people made goods to sell in small workshops, often in their own homes. But enormous new
machines (Q35)
were now being created that could produce the goods faster and on a larger scale, and these required a lot more space. So large factories were built, replacing the workshops, and forcing workers to travel to work. In fact. large numbers of people migrated from villages into towns as a result.
As well as manufacturing, there were new technologies in transport, contributing to the growth of consumerism. The horse-drawn stagecoaches and carts of the 18th century, which carried very few people and goods, and travelled slowly along poorly surfaced roads, were gradually replaced by the numerous canals that were constructed. These were particularly important for the transportation of goods. The canals gradually fell out of use, though, as railways were developed, becoming the main way of moving goods and people from one end of the country to the other. And the goods they moved weren’t just coal, iron, clothes, and so on – significantly, they included
newspapers (Q36)
, which meant that thousands of people were not only more knowledgeable about what was going on in the country, but could also read about what was available in the shops. And that encouraged them to buy more. So faster forms of transport resulted in distribution becoming far more efficient -goods could now be sold all over the country, instead of just in the
local (Q37)
market.
The third main area that saw changes that contributed to consumerism was retailing, The number and quality of shops grew rapidly, and in particular, small shops suffered as customers flocked to the growing number of department stores – a form of retailing that was new in the 19th century. The entrepreneurs who opened these found new ways to stock them with goods, and to attract customers: for instance, improved
lighting (Q38)
inside greatly increased the visibility of the goods for sale. Another development that made goods more visible from outside resulted from the use of plate glass, which made it possible for
windows (Q39)
to be much larger than previously. New ways of promoting goods were introduced, too. Previously, the focus had been on informing potential customers about the availability of goods; now there was an explosion in
advertising (Q40)
trying to persuade people to go shopping.
Flanders claims that one of the great effects of the Industrial Revolution was that it created choice. All sorts of things that had previously been luxuries – from sugar to cutlery-became conveniences, and before long they’d turned into necessities: life without sugar or cutlery was unimaginable.Rather like mobile phones these days!

雅思听力
原文
LIBRARIAN:           Good afternoon. Can I help you?
STUDENT:               Good afternoon. Yes, I’ve just transferred to the School of Education, and I’d like information about joining the library.
LIBRARIAN:           Well, the School of Education has libraries on two sites, as I’m sure you know. This one here is the Fordham Site, and the other is on Castle Road.
STUDENT:               And is there any difference between the two libraries?
LIBRARIAN:           Not in terms of their facilities. Access to online databases and the Internet is available at both sites and each site has a range of
reference
materials on education.
Q21
STUDENT:               Oh yes. I see.
LIBRARIAN:           But the Castle Road site has books on the sociology of education and a collection of
textbooks
and teaching resources covering most of the subjects taught in
secondary
schools.
Q22    Q23
STUDENT:               Ah, right, but I’m training to be a primary teacher so I need to look at materials for the five to eleven age group.
LIBRARIAN:           Then you’ve come to the right place. At Fordham we hold material relating to
primary
education, as well as special needs, but of course you’ll need to familiarise yourself with both sites to make the most of our resources.
Q24
STUDENT:               You haven’t mentioned periodicals. Are they held at both sites?
LIBRARIAN:           Current issues, yes but if you want to look at
back
issues you’ll need to use the CD-ROM databases which are held here at Fordham.
Q25
STUDENT:               I see. Now, about borrowing books. I’m living out of town, so I’m hoping I can borrow quite a few items, and cut down on the number of trips I have to make.
LIBRARIAN:           Right, well, members can borrow two books at a time from each site.
STUDENT:               Only two books?
LIBRARIAN:           Only two from each site, but that’s four altogether.
STUDENT:               Oh I see, and how long can I hang on to them for?
LIBRARIAN:          The borrowing period is one month, but of course books can be renewed. You can renew any item a maximum of three times.
STUDENT:               Do I have to come to the library to do that?
LIBRARIAN:           No, you can do it by telephone or email, but you can’t renew
overdue
books this way, only before or on the due date stamped in the book. We’ll need your full name, your borrower number and the name of the site library you borrowed the items from.   Q26
STUDENT:               So theoretically I can borrow books for up to three months – is that what you’re saying?
LIBRARIAN:           Yes, provided they’re not recalled.
STUDENT:               So, what happens then?
LIBRARIAN:           Well, sometimes an item is requested by another borrower, in which case we’d send you a letter, and you’d have to return the book within
seven working days
. Don’t forget we’re closed on Sundays.
Q27
STUDENT:               OK.
STUDENT:               I expect it’ll take me a while to find what I need. There’s such a lot here.
LIBRARIAN:           Yes there is, but if you need help getting started, this term we’re running three study skills workshops.
STUDENT:               Oh? What are they on?
LIBRARIAN:           Er, let me see. The first one’s on resources – yes, here it is.
How to use the library’s resources. That includes everything, not just the print and technical resources
.
Q28/29/30
STUDENT:               That sounds useful. Is there anything on using the Internet?
LIBRARIAN:           Er, let’s see. The one on the Internet for beginners was last term.
This term it’s finding research materials online
.
Q28/29/30
STUDENT:               That sounds interesting too, hm, what’s the last one?
LIBRARIAN:           It’s a
workshop on dissertations
.
Q28/29/30
STUDENT:
What do you mean – how to write one
?
LIBRARIAN:           Er, no
it’s more to do with academic writing conventions
, you know -writing a bibliography and how to refer to sources in your text. That sort of thing. Anyway, here’s a leaflet with information about all three.

And one more question in this section.
What is the reason for you coming into town today?
LUISA
: Actually it’s not for shopping today, which would be my normal reason, but to see the
dentist (Q5)
.
INTERVIEWER
: Right.
Thanks.
INTERVIEWER
: Now in this last section I’d like you to give us some ideas about the facilities and arrangements in the city for getting to and from work, er, any suggestions you have for improvements.
LUISA
: Well, something I’ve thought about for some time is that when I do walk and I’m doing a later shift, I think the
lighting (Q6)
should be better.
INTERVIEWER
: Yes, good point.
LUISA
: And of course.
I think it’s a real shame they’ve been cutting down on the number of footpaths.
They should have more of those.
Then people would walk more.
INTERVIEWER
: Yes, right.
LUISA
: And, I don’t think there are enough
trains (Q7)
.
That’s why I don’t use them—you have to wait so long.
INTERVIEWER
: Thanks.
And finally I’d like to ask your opinion on cycling.
As you may know, there’s a drive in the city to get more people to cycle to work.
LUISA
: Right.
INTERVIEWER
: But we realise that there are things which the council, but also employers, might do to help encourage workers to cycle to work.
LUISA
: Yep.
Well, I have thought about it and where I work there are no
safe (Q8)
places to leave your bikes.
INTERVIEWER
:OK.
LUISA
: And also.
I’d have to cycle uphill and on a hot day, I’d arrive at work pretty sweaty so I think I’d need a
shower (Q9)
somewhere at work.
INTERVIEWER
: Right.
LUISA
: And I suppose the last thing is that I wouldn’t be all that confident about cycling on such busy roads.
I think I’d like to see you offering
training (Q10)
for that, you know, I’d feel a lot better about starting if that was the case.
INTERVIEWER
: Well, that’s very helpful.
Thank you very much for your time.
LUISA
:No problem.
Bye.

原文
In the last few weeks, we’ve been looking at various aspects of the social history of London, and this morning we’re continuing with a look at life in the area called the East End. I’ll start with a brief history of the district, and then focus on life in the first half of the twentieth century.
Back in the first to the fourth centuries AD, when the Romans controlled England, London grew into a town of 45,000 people, and what’s now the East End – the area by the river Thames, and along the road heading north-east from London to the coast – consisted of farmland with crops and livestock which helped to
feed
that population.
Q31
The Romans left in 410, at the beginning of the fifth century, and from then onwards the country suffered a series of invasions by tribes from present-day Germany and Denmark, the Angles, Saxons and Jutes, many of whom settled in the East End. The technology they introduced meant that
metal
and
leather
goods were produced there for the first time. And as the East End was by the river, ships could transport goods between there and foreign markets.
Q32
In the eleventh century, in 1066 to be precise, the Normans conquered England, and during the next few centuries London became one of the most powerful and prosperous cities in Europe. The East End benefited from this, and because there were fewer
restrictions
there than in the city itself, plenty of newcomers settled there from abroad, bringing their skills as workers, merchants or money-lenders during the next few hundred years.
Q33
In the sixteenth century the first dock was dug where
ships
were constructed, eventually making the East End the focus of massive international trade. And in the late sixteenth century, when much of the rest of
England
was suffering economically, a lot of agricultural workers came to the East End to look for alternative work.
Q34    Q35
In the seventeenth century, the East End was still a series of separate, semi-rural settlements. There was a shortage of accommodation, so marshland was drained and
built
on to house the large numbers of people now living there.
Q36
By the nineteenth century London was the busiest port in the world, and this became the main source of employment in the East End. Those who could afford to live in more pleasant surroundings moved out, and the area became one where the vast majority of people lived in extreme
poverty
and suffered from appalling sanitary conditions.
Q37
That brief outline takes us to the beginning of the twentieth century, and now we’ll turn to housing.
At the beginning of the century, living conditions for the majority of working people in East London were very basic indeed.
Houses were crowded closely together and usually very badly built
, because there was no regulation. But the poor and needy were attracted by the possibility of work, and they had to be housed. It was the availability, rather than the condition, of the housing that was the major concern for tenants and landlords alike.
Q38
Few houses had electricity at this time, so other sources of power were used, like coal for the fires which heated perhaps just one room.
Of course, the smoke from these contributed a great deal to the air pollution for which London used to be famous.
Q39
A tiny, damp, unhealthy house like this might well be occupied by two full families, possibly including several children, grandparents, aunts and uncles.
Q40
Now, before I go on to health implications of this way of life, I’ll say something about food and nutrition.

原文
Today we’re going to look at one of my favourite fish – the shark. As you know, sharks have a reputation for being very dangerous creatures capable of injuring or killing humans, and I’d like to talk about sharks in Australia.
Sharks are rather large fish, often growing to over ten metres and the longest sharks caught in Australia have reached sixteen metres. Sharks vary in weight with size and breed, of course, but the heaviest shark caught in Australia was a White Pointer – that,  weighed
seven hundred and ninety-five
kilograms – quite a size! Sharks have a different structure to most fish: instead of a skeleton made of bone, they have a tough elastic skeleton of cartilage. Unlike bone, this firm, pliable material is rather like your nose, and allows the shark to bend easily as it swims. The shark’s skin isn’t covered with scales, like other fish: instead the skin’s covered with barbs, giving it a rough texture like sandpaper. As you know, sharks are very quick swimmers. This is made possible by their fins, one set at the side and another set underneath the body, and the
tail
also helps the shark move forward quickly.
Q31 Q32
Unlike other fish, sharks have to keep swimming if they want to stay at a particular depth, and they rarely swim at the surface. Mostly, they swim at the bottom of the ocean, scavenging and picking up food that’s lying on the ocean
floor
While most other animals, including fish, hunt their prey by means of their eyesight, sharks hunt essentially by smell. They have a very acute
sense of smell
– and can sense the presence of food long before they can see it.
Q33 Q34
In Australia, where people spend a lot of time at the beach, the government has realised that it must prevent sharks from swimming near its beaches. As a result, they’ve introduced a beach-netting program. Beach-netting, or meshing, involves
setting large nets parallel to the shore
; this means that the nets on New South Wales beaches are set on one day, and then lifted and taken out to sea on the next day. When shark-netting first began in 1939, only the Sydney metropolitan beaches were meshed – these beaches were chosen because beaches near the city are usually the most crowded with swimmers. Ten years later, in 1949, systematic meshing was extended to include the beaches to the south of Sydney. As a result of the general success of the program in Sydney, shark-meshing was introduced to the state of Queensland around 1970. The New Zealand authorities also looked at it, but considered meshing uneconomical – as did Tahiti in the Pacific. At around the same time,
South Africa
introduced meshing to some of its most popular swimming beaches.
Q35 Q36
When meshing began, approximately fifteen hundred sharks were caught in the first year. However, this declined in the years that followed, and since that time, the average annual catch has been only about
a hundred and fifty
a year. The majority of sharks are caught
during the warmest months, from November to February
, when sharks are most active and when both the air and the ocean are at their maximum temperature.
Q37 Q38
Despite quite large catches, some people believe that shark meshing is not the best way to catch sharks. It’s not that they think sharks are afraid of nets, or because they eat holes in them, because neither of these is true. But meshing does appear to be less effective than some other methods, especially when there are big seas with
high rolling waves and strong currents
and anything that lets
the sand move
– the sand that’s holding the nets down. When this moves the nets will also become less effective.

剑桥雅思11
test2 Section4
雅思听力
原文
We’ve been discussing the factors the architect has to consider when designing domestic buildings. I’m going to move on now to consider the design of public buildings, and I’ll illustrate this by referring to the new Taylor Concert Hall that’s recently been completed here in the city.
So, as with a domestic building, when designing a public building, an architect needs to consider the function of the building – for example, is it to be used primarily for entertainment, or for education, or for administration? The second thing the architect needs to think about is the context of the building, this includes its physical location, obviously, but it also includes the
social (Q31)
meaning of the building, how it relates to the people it’s built for. And finally, for important public buildings, the architect may also be looking for a central symbolic idea on which to base the design, a sort of metaphor for the building and the way in which it is used.
Let’s look at the new Taylor Concert Hall in relation to these ideas. The location chosen was a site in a run-down district that has been ignored in previous redevelopment plans. It was occupied by a
factory (Q32)
that had been empty for some years. The whole area was some distance from the high-rise office blocks of the central business district and shopping centre, but it was only one kilometre from the ring road. The site itself was bordered to the north by a
canal (Q33)
which had once been used by boats bringing in raw materials when the area was used for manufacturing.
The architect chosen for the project was Tom Harrison. He found the main design challenge was the location of the site in an area that had no neighbouring buildings of any importance. To reflect the fact that the significance of the building in this quite run-down location was as yet unknown, he decided to create a building centred around the idea of a mystery – something whose meaning still has to be discovered.
So how was this reflected in the design of the building? Well, Harrison decided to create pedestrian access to the building and to make use of the presence of water on the site. As people approach the entrance, they therefore have to cross over a
bridge (Q34)
. He wanted to give people a feeling of suspense as they see the building first from a distance, and then close-up, and the initial impression he wanted to create from the shape of the building as a whole was that of a
box
(Q35)
. The first side that people see, the southern wall, is just a high, flat wall uninterrupted by any windows. This might sound off-putting, but it supports Harrison’s concept of the building – that the person approaching is intrigued and wonders what will be inside. And this flat wall also has another purpose. At night-time, projectors are switched on and it functions as a huge
screen (Q36)
, onto which images are projected.
The auditorium itself seats 1500 people. The floor’s supported by ten massive pads. These are constructed from
rubber
(Q37)
, and so are able to absorb any vibrations from outside and prevent them from affecting the auditorium. The walls are made of several layers of honey-coloured wood, all sourced from local beech trees. In order to improve the acoustic properties of the auditorium and to amplify the sound, they are not straight, they are
curved (Q38)
. The acoustics are also adjustable according to the size of orchestra and the type of music being played. In order to achieve this, there are nine movable panels in the ceiling above the orchestra which are all individually motorized, and the walls also have
curtains (Q39)
which can be opened or closed to change the acoustics.
The reaction of the public to the new building has generally been positive. However, the evaluation of some critics has been less enthusiastic. In spite of Harrison’s efforts to use local materials, they criticise the style of the design as being
international (Q40)
rather than local, and say it doesn’t reflect features of the landscape or society for which it is built.

OG剑桥雅思官方指南Test7Section3听力原文与答案 Marketing Report
剑桥雅思官方指南听力第七套题目第三部分的主题为市场营销报告。具体内容包括Leo选择速溶咖啡的原因，技术进步的影响，报告中需要改进的地方，学校作业与这次报告的区别等。下面是其对应的录音原文与答案。
OG
Test7 Section3听力原文
Leo:
Anna, I wanted to ask you about my marketing report. I’m not sure about it …
Anna:
That’s OK, Leo. So what do you have to do?
Leo:
Choose a product or service then compare two organisations that produce it. I’m doing instant coffee.
Anna:
But haven’t you got a weekend job in a clothing store? Why didn’t you choose clothing?
Leo:
That was my first thought, because I thought it’d give me some practical examples, but when I searched for men’s clothing on the Internet there were hardly any articles.
So then I looked for coffee and I found there were tons (Q21)
.
Anna:
Yeah, there are so many brands on the market now. OK, so how much have you actually written?
Leo:
I’ve done part one, on economic and technological factors. I found some good data on technological changes, how in Australia
fewer people are buying instant coffee because of cheap coffee percolators that they can use to make real coffee (Q22)
at home.
Anna:
But there’s also a movement away from drinking Coffee …
Leo:
… switching to things like herbal teas instead because they think it’s healthier? But that’s not really to do with technology, it’s more cultural. Anyway, for part two I’m comparing two instant coffee companies, CoffeeNow and Shaffers, and I’ve made this table of products.
Anna:
Right. Let’s see … so you’ve got the brand names, and prices and selling size, and descriptions. OK, the table looks good, you’ll get marks for research there. Where will it go?
Leo:
In the section on the marketing mix, under ‘Product’.
Anna:
Not in the appendix?
Leo:
No.
Anna:
OK, but it’s too factual on its own,
you need to add some comment in that section about the implications of the figures (Q23)
.
Leo:
Right, I’ll do that. Now I want to say that I think that Shaffers is more of a follower than a leader in the coffee industry. Now, I’m putting that in the section on market share. Does that seem OK?
Anna:
Let’s see … so you’ve begun by explaining what market share is, that’s important, but you’ve got to be careful how you give that opinion.
Leo:
Do you think it should go in another section?
Anna:
Well, it’s fine where it is but
you’ve got to back it up with some data (Q24)
or they’ll say your report lacks weight.
Leo:
OK. One thing I’m worried about is finding anything original to say.
Anna:
Well, since this is your first marketing report, you’re not expected to go out and do interviews and things to collect your own data, you’re just using published data. So the analysis you do might not throw up anything that people didn’t know before. But the focus is more on how you handle the data – I mean, t his article is you might take something like a graph of sales directly from a website, but
what makes your work original is the perspective you provide by your interpretation of it (Q25)
.
Leo:
Oh. You know, it’s all so different from business studies assignments at school. It’s really surprised me.
Anna:
What, how much research you have to do?
Leo:
I expected that. It’s more… I knew exactly what I had to do to get a good grade at school – and I knew I’d be expected to go more deeply into things here, but
I haven’t got information on how the lecturer is going to grade my work (Q26)
– what he’s looking for.
Anna:
Well, one thing you have to remember is that in a marketing report you’ve got to have what they call an executive summary at the beginning. I forgot that and I got marked down.
Leo:
Yeah, I’ve drafted it. I’ve got an overview.
Anna:
Have you got something about the
background (Q27)
there?
Leo:
Yeah.
Anna:
Good.
Leo:
So I’ve just made a summary of the main points. I wasn’t sure whether or not I should have my aims there.
Anna:
No, that’s too personal. The executive summary is just, like, what a manager would read to get a general idea of your report if he was in a hurry.
Leo:
Right. Then I’m OK for the first main part, all of the macroenvironment stuff, but it’s when I get onto the problems section… I’ve listed all the problems that CoffeeNow and Shaffers are facing, but then what?
Anna:
Well you have to prioritise, so indicate the main problems, and then you analyse each one by connecting it with a
theory (Q28)
… that’s where your reading comes in.
Leo:
OK.
Anna:
Have you done your implementation section yet?
Leo:
I’ve thought about it – so that’s where I write about what could be done about the problems.
Anna:
Yes, and it’s got to be practical so don’t forget to specify things like who would be involved, and the
cost (Q29)
, and the order that things would be done in.
Leo:
Right. Well, that shouldn’t take long.
Anna:
You’d be surprised. Actually that’s the bit that tends to get badly done because people run out of
time (Q30)
. That and the conclusion …
Leo:
Any hints for that?
Anna:
Well, it’s got to draw out the main points from your report, so it’s got to be quite general. You need to avoid introducing new stuff here, it’s got to sum up what you’ve said earlier.
Leo:
OK. Thanks Anna. That’s been a big help.

原文
Beth: Oh good morning. You must be James.
I’m Beth Cartwright – please call me Beth.
James: Thank you.
Beth: Now as this is your first
tutorial
since you started on the Scandinavian Studies course, I’d like to find out something about you.
Why did you decide to take this course?
James: Well, my mother is Danish, and although we always lived in England, she used to talk about her home a lot, and that made me want to visit
Denmark
.
We hardly ever did, though – my mother usually went on her own.
But whenever her relations or friends were in England they always came to see us (Q21).
Beth: I see. So I assume you already speak Danish, one of the languages you’ll be studying.
James: I can get by when I talk to people, though I’m not terribly accurate.
Beth: Now you probably know that you’ll spend the third year of the course abroad.
Have you had any thoughts about that?
James: I’m really looking forward to it.
And although
Denmark
seems the obvious place to go, because of my family connections, I’d love to spend the time in Iceland.
Beth: Oh, I’m sure it can be arranged.
Do you have any plans for when you graduate?
A lot of students go on to take a master’s degree.
James: I think the four years of the undergraduate course will be enough for me.
I’m interested in
journalism
, and I
quite like the idea of moving to
Scandinavia
and writing for magazines (Q22)
.
I’d find that more creative than translating, which I suppose most graduates do.
Beth: OK. Now how are you finding the courses you’re taking this term, James?
James: Well, I’m really enjoying the one on Swedish cinema.
Beth: That’ll continue next term,
but the one on Scandinavian literature that’s running at the moment will be replaced by more specialised courses (Q23)
.
Oh, and by the way, if you’re interested in watching Danish television programmes – there’s going to be a course on that the term after next.
James: That sounds good.
Beth: Have you started thinking about the literature paper that you have to write in the next few weeks?
James: Yes, my first choice would be to do something on the Icelandic sagas.
Beth: Hmm. The trouble with that is that a lot of people choose that topic, and it can be difficult to get hold of the books you’ll need.
Why not leave that for another time?
James: Right.
Beth: You might find modern novels or 19th century playwrights interestin
g
.
James:
I’ve read or seen several plays in translation, so that would be a good idea
(Q24)
.
Beth: Fine. I’ll put you down for that topic.
James: Right. So what would you advise me to aim at in the paper?
Beth: First I suggest you avoid taking one writer and going into a great deal of detail.
That approach certainly has its place,
but I think you first need to get an understanding of the literature in the context of the society in which it was produced – who it was written for, how it was
published, and so on (Q25)
.
I also think that’s more fruitful than placing it within the history of the
genre
.
James: OK, that sounds reasonable.
James: Could I ask for some advice about writing the paper I’m working on about the Vikings?
I have to do that this week, and I’m a bit stuck.
Beth: Of course. Have you decided yet what to write about?
James: No, I haven’t. There’s so much that seems interesting – Viking settlement in other countries, trade,
mythology
…
Beth: Well,
what I suggest is that you read an
assignment
a student wrote last year (Q26)
, which is kept in the library.
It’s short and well focused, and I’m sure you’ll find it helpful.
I’ll give you the details in a moment.
Textbooks usually cover so many topics, it can be very difficult to choose just
one.
James: OK. I’ve got a DVD of the film about the Vikings that came out earlier this year.
Should I watch that again?
Beth: If it’s the one I am thinking of, hmm, I’d ignore it – it’s more fantasy than reality.
But I’ve got a recording of a
documentary
that you should watch (Q27)
.
It makes some interesting and
provocative
points, which I think will help you to focus your topic.
James: Right.
James:
So then should I work out an
outline (Q28)
?
Beth:
Yes. Just headings for different sections, at this stage.
And then you should start looking for suitable articles and books to draw on, and take notes which you organise according to those headings (Q29)
.
James: I see.
Beth:
Then put short phrases and sentences as bullet points under each heading (Q30)
.
Make sure that this
skeleton
makes sense and flows properly, before writing up the paper in full.
James: OK. Thanks, that’s very helpful.

PIETER:                   I haven’t really thought. Um, what’s the usual thing?

原文
WOMAN:       Good morning. How can I help you?
MAN:          Hello. I’m interested in renting a house somewhere in the town.
WOMAN:       Right. Could I have your name please?
MAN:          Yes, it’s Steven Godfrey.
WOMAN:       And tell me how many bedrooms you’re looking for.
MAN:          Well, we’d need
four (Example)
, because I’m going to share the house with three friends.
WOMAN:       Okay, there are several of that size on our books. They mostly belong to families who are working abroad at the moment. What about the location?
MAN:          It’d be nice to be
central (Q1)
.
WOMAN:       That might be difficult, as most houses of that size are in the suburbs. Still, there are a few. What’s your upper limit for the rent?
MAN:          We’d like something around ￡500 a month, but we could go up to
￡600 (Q2)
if  we have to. But we can’t go beyond that.
WOMAN:       Do you know how long you want to rent the house for? The minimum let is six months, as you probably realise.
MAN:          We’re at college here for
two years
(Q3)
, and we don’t want to have to move during that time if we can avoid it.
WOMAN:       Right. And how soon do you want to move in? All our lets start on the first of the month.
MAN:          Well, as soon as possible, really, so that means September 1st
WOMAN:       Okay, let me have a look at what we’ve got…. We have photographs of all the houses on our books, so you can get an idea of what they’re like. There’s this one in Oakington Avenue, at ￡550 a month. Combined living room and dining room, with a separate kitchen. It doesn’t have a
garage (Q4)
, though you can park in the road.
MAN:          Ah, we’d prefer to have one, if possible.
WOMAN:       Right. Then have a look at this house, in Mead Street. It’s got a very large living room and kitchen, bathroom, cloakroom. . .
MAN:          How much is it?
WOMAN:       That one’s 580. It’s very well furnished and equipped. It also has plenty of space for parking, and it’s available for a minimum of a year. Oh, and there’s a big
garden (Q5)
.
MAN:          I don’t think we could cope with that, to be honest. We’ll be too busy to look after it.
WOMAN:       Okay. Then there’s this older house in Hamilton Road: living room, kitchen-diner, and it has a
study (Q6)
. 550 a month.
MAN:          That looks rather nice. But whereabouts in Hamilton Road?
WOMAN:       Towards the western end.
MAN:          Oh, that’ll be very
noisy (Q7)
. I know the area.
WOMAN:       Yes, it’s pretty lively. Some people like it, though. Well, what about this house in Devon Close?
MAN:          That looks lovely.
WOMAN:       There’s a big demand for houses in that area, so prices tend to be quite high. But this one hasn’t been decorated for a few years, which has kept the rent down a bit. It’s got a living room, dining room and small kitchen, and it’s
595
(Q8)
a month. I think it would suit you, from what you’ve said.
MAN:          It sounds fine.
MAN:          Why’s that part of town so popular?
WOMAN:       Well, there’s a big scheme to improve the district, and it’ll soon have the best facilities for miles around.
MAN:          What sort of thing?
WOMAN:       There’s a big sports centre under construction, which will be very impressive when it’s finished. In fact,
the swimming pool’s already opened (Q9)
, ahead of schedule, and it’s attracting a lot of people.
MAN:          What about cinemas: are there any in the area?
WOMAN:       The only one closed down last year, and it’s now in the process of being converted into a film museum. The local people are trying to get a new cinema added to the scheme.
MAN:          I think I heard something about a plan to replace
the existing concert hall (Q10)
with a larger one.
WOMAN:       Ah, that’s due to start next year.
MAN:          Well it sounds an interesting area to live in. Could I go and see the house, please?
WOMAN:        Yes, of course.

剑桥雅思13 test2 section4
雅思听力
原文
Today, we’ll be continuing the series of lectures on memory by focusing on what is called episodic memory and what can happen if this is not working properly.
Episodic memory refers to the memory of an event or ‘episode’. Episodic memories allow us to mentally travel back in time to an event from the past. Episodic memories include various details about these events, for example, when an event happened and other information such as the
location (Q31)
. To help understand this concept, try to remember the last time you ate dinner at a restaurant. The ability to remember where you ate, who you were with and the items you ordered are all features of an episodic memory.
Episodic memory is distinct from another type of memory called semantic memory. This is the type of factual memory that we have in common with everyone else – that is your general knowledge of the
world (Q32)
. To build upon a previous example, remembering where you parked your car is an example of episodic memory, but your understanding of what a car is and how an engine works are examples of semantic memory. Unlike episodic memory, semantic memory isn’t dependent on recalling
personal (Q33)
experiences.
Episodic memory can be thought of as a process with several different steps of memory processing: encoding, consolidation and retrieval.
The initial step is called encoding. This involves the process of receiving and registering information, which is necessary for creating memories of information or events that you experience. The degree to which you can successfully encode information depends on the level of
attention (Q34)
you give to an event while it’s actually happening. Being distracted can make effective encoding very difficult. Encoding of episodic memories is also influenced by how you process the event. For example, if you were introduced to someone called Charlie. you might make the connection that your uncle has the same
name (Q35)
. Future recollection of Charlie’s name is much easier if you have a strategy to help you encode it.
Memory consolidation, the next step in forming an episodic memory, is the process by which memories of encoded information are strengthened, stabilised and stored to facilitate later retrieval. Consolidation is most effective when the information being stored can be linked to an existing
network (Q36)
of information. Consolidation makes it possible for you to store memories for later retrieval indefinitely. Forming strong memories depends on the
frequency (Q37)
with which you try to retrieve them. Memories can fade or become harder to retrieve if they aren’t used very often.
The last step in forming episodic memories is called retrieval, which is the conscious recollection of encoded information. Retrieving information from episodic memory depends upon semantic, olfactory, auditory and visual factors. These help episodic memory retrieval by acting as a prompt. For example, when recalling where you parked your car you may use the
colour (Q38)
of a sign close to where you parked. You actually have to mentally travel back to the moment you parked.
There are a wide range of neurological diseases and conditions that can affect episodic memory. These range from Alzheimer’s to schizophrenia to autism. An impairment of episodic memory can have a profound effect on individuals’ lives. For example, the symptoms of schizophrenia can be reasonably well controlled by medication; however, patients’ episodic memory may still be impaired and so they are often unable to return to university or work. Recent studies have shown that computer-assisted games designed to keep the
brain (Q39)
active can help improve their episodic memory.
Episodic memories can help people connect with others, for instance by sharing intimate details about their past: something individuals with autism often have problems with. This may be caused by an absence of a sense of
self (Q40)
. This is essential for the storage of episodic memory, and has been found to be impaired in children with autism. Research has shown that treatments that improve memory may also have a positive impact on children’s social development.

剑桥雅思18 Test4 Part2
雅思听力
原文
Good morning everyone, and welcome to the Museum of Farming Life. I understand it’s your first visit here, so I’d like to give you some background information about the museum and then explain a little about what you can see during your visit.
So, where we’re standing at the moment is the entrance to
a large building that was constructed in 1880 as the home of a local businessman (Q11)
, Alfred Palmer, of the Palmer biscuit factory. It was later sold and became a hall of residence for students in 1911, and a museum in 1951. In 2005, a modern extension was built to accommodate the museum’s collections.
The museum’s owned by the university, and apart from two rooms that are our offices,
the university uses the main part of the building. You may see students going into the building for lessons (Q12)
, but it’s not open to museum visitors, I’m afraid. It’s a shame because the interior architectural features are outstanding, especially the room that used to be the library.
Luckily, we’ve managed to keep entry to the museum free. This includes access to all the galleries, outdoor areas and the rooms for special exhibitions. We run activities for children and students, such as the museum club, for which there’s no charge.
We do have a donation box just over there so feel free to give whatever amount you consider appropriate (Q13)
.
We do have a cloakroom, if you’d like to leave your coats and bags somewhere (Q14)
. Unlike other museums, photography is allowed here, so you might like to keep your cameras with you. You might be more comfortable not carrying around heavy rucksacks, though
keep your coats and jackets on as it’s quite cold in the museum garden today (Q14)
.
I’d like to tell you about the different areas of the museum.
Just inside, and outside the main gallery, we have an area called Four Seasons. Here you can watch a four-minute animation of a woodland scene.
It was designed especially for the museum by a group of young people on a film studies course (Q15)
, and it’s beautiful. Children absolutely love it, but then, so do adults.
The main gallery’s called Town and Country. It includes a photographic collection of prize-winning sheep and shepherds. Leaving Town and Country,  you enter Farmhouse Kitchen, which is …well, self-explanatory. Here we have the oldest collection of equipment for making butter and cheese in the country.
And this morning, a specialist cheesemaker will be giving demonstrations of how it’s produced (Q16)
. You may even get to try some.
After that, you can go in two directions. To the right is a staircase that takes you up to a landing from where you can look down on the galleries. To the left is a room called A Year on the Farm. There’s lots of seating here as sometimes we use the room for school visits, so it’s a good place to stop for a rest.
If you’re feeling competitive, you can take our memory test in which you answer questions about things you’ve seen in the museum (Q17)
.
The next area’s called Wagon Walk. This contains farm carts from nearly every part of the country. It’s surprising how much regional variation there was. Beside the carts are display boards with information about each one.
The carts are old and fragile, so we ask you to keep your children close to you and ensure they don’t climb on the carts (Q18)
.
From Wagon Walk, you can either make your way back to reception or go out into the garden- or even go back to take another look in the galleries. In the far corner of the garden is Beesare Magic,
but we’re redeveloping this area so you can’t visit that at the moment (Q19)
. You can still buy our honey in the shop, though.
Finally, there’s The Pond, which contains all kinds of interesting wildlife.
There are baby ducks that are only a few days old, as well as tiny frogs (Q20)
. The Pond isn’t deep and there’s a fence around it, so it’s perfectly safe for children.

剑桥雅思16 Test1 Part4
雅思听力
原文
Ancient philosophy is not just about talking or lecturing, or even reading long, dense books In fact, it is something people have used throughout history – to solve their problems and to achieve their greatest triumphs.
Specifically, I am referring to Stoicism, which, in my opinion, is the most
practical (Q31)
of all philosophies and therefore the most appealing. Stoicism was founded in Ancient Greece by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC, but was practised by the likes of Epictetus, Cato, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius. Amazingly, we still have access to these ideas, despite the fact that the most famous Stoics never wrote anything down for
publication (Q32)
. Cato definitely didn’t. Marcus Aurelius never intended his
Meditations
to be anything but personal. Seneca’s letters were, well, letters and Epictetus’ thoughts come to us by way of a note-taking student.
Stoic principles were based on the idea that its followers could have an unshakable happiness in this life and the key to achieving this was virtue. The road to virtue, in turn, lay in understanding that destructive emotions, like anger and jealousy, are under our conscious control – they don’t have to control us, because we can learn to control them. In the words of Epictetus: “external events I cannot control, but the
choices (Q33)
I make with regard to them. I do control”.
The modern day philosopher and writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb defines a Stoic as someone who has a different perspective on experiences which most of us would see as wholly
negative (Q34)
; a Stoic “transforms fear into caution, pain into transformation, mistakes into initiation and desire into undertaking”. Using this definition as a model, we can see that throughout the centuries Stoicism has been practised in more recent history by kings, presidents, artists, writers and entrepreneurs.
The founding fathers of the United States were inspired by the philosophy. George Washington was introduced to Stoicism by his neighbours at age seventeen, and later. put on a
play (Q35)
based on the life of Cato to inspire his men. Thomas Jefferson kept a copy of Seneca beside his bed.
Writers and artists have also been inspired by the stoics. Eugène Delacroix, the renowned French Romantic artist (known best for his painting
Liberty Leading the People
) was an ardent Stoic, referring to it as his “consoling religion”.
The economist Adam Smith’s theories on
capitalism (Q36)
were significantly influenced by the Stoicism that he studied as a schoolboy, under a teacher who had translated Marcus Aurelius works.
Today’s political leaders are no different, with many finding their inspiration from the ancient texts. Former US president Bill Clinton rereads Marcus Aurelius every single year, and many have compared former President Obama’s calm leadership style to that of Cato. Wen Jiabao the former prime minister of China, claims that
Meditations
is one of two books he travels with and that he has read it more than one hundred times over the course of his life.
Stoicism had a profound influence on Albert Ellis. who invented Cognitive Behaviour Therapy which is used to help people manage their problems by changing the way that they think and behave. It’s most commonly used to treat
depression (Q37)
. The idea is that we can take control of our lives by challenging the irrational beliefs that create our faulty thinking, symptoms and behaviours by using
logic (Q38)
instead
Stoicism has also become popular in the world of business. Stoic principles can build the resilience and state of mind required to overcome setbacks because Stoics teach turning obstacles into
opportunity (Q39)
. A lesson every business entrepreneur needs to learn.
I would argue that studying Stoicism is as relevant today as it was 2,000 years ago, thanks to its brilliant insights into how to lead a good life. At the very root of the thinking, there is a very simple way of living -control what you can and accept what you can’t. This is not as easy as it sounds and will require considerable
practice (Q40)
– it can take a lifetime to master. The Stoics also believed the most important foundation for a good and happy life is not money, fame power or pleasure, but having a disciplined and principled character – something which seems to resonate with many people today.

TUTOR:                   Hello, can I help you?
BRIAN:                    I was told to come here, because I’d like to talk to someone about taking a management course.
TUTOR:                   Right. I’m one of the tutors, so I should be able to help you.
BRIAN:                    Oh, good. My name’s Brian Ardley. I’ve decided to enrol on a part-time management course. A friend of mine took one last year, and recommended it to me.
TUTOR:                   Right.
BRIAN:                    Is there anything I should do before the course, like reading or anything?
TUTOR:                   We prefer to integrate reading with the course, so we don’t give out a reading list in advance. But we like people to write a case study, describing an organisation they know.
BRIAN:                    I’ve already done that, as my friends told me you wanted one. But would it be possible to
sit in on a teaching session
, to see what it’s like? I haven’t been a student for quite a while.
Q21
TUTOR:                   Fine. Just let me know which date, and I’ll arrange it with the tutor.
BRIAN:                    Now, could I ask you about the college facilities, please?
TUTOR:                   Anything in particular?
BRIAN:                    Well, the course is one day a week, all day, isn’t it? So presumably it’s possible to buy food?
TUTOR:                   Yes, the refectory’s open all day.
BRIAN:                    Does it cater for special diets? I have some food allergies.
TUTOR:                   Provided you warn the refectory
in advance
, it won’t be a problem.
Q22
BRIAN:                    Good. What about facilities for young children? I’d like to bring my daughter here while I’m studying.
TUTOR:                   How old is she?
BRIAN:                    Three.
TUTOR:                   Then she’s eligible to join the
nursery
, which is supervised by a qualified Nursery Nurse. The waiting list for a place is quite long though, so you ought to apply now.
Q23
BRIAN:                    OK.
TUTOR:                   I don’t know if our careers advice service would be of any interest to you?
BRIAN:                    Yes, it might help me decide how to develop my career after the course.
TUTOR:                   The centre has a lot of reference materials, and staff qualified to give guidance on a one-to-one basis.
BRIAN:                    I noticed a fitness centre next to the college. Is that for students?
TUTOR:                   It’s open to everyone, but students pay an
annual fee
that’s much less than the general public pay.
Q24
BRIAN:                    And presumably the college library stocks newspapers and journals, as well as books?
TUTOR:                   Yes, and there’s also an audio-visual room, for viewing and listening to videos, cassettes, and so on.
BRIAN:                    Is there also access to computers?
TUTOR:                   Yes, your
tutor
will need to arrange with the technical support team for you to get a password, so ask him or her about it when you start the course.
Q25
BRIAN:                    OK.
TUTOR:                   By the way, do you know about our Business Centre?
BRIAN:                    No. What’s that?
TUTOR:                   It’s a training resource a collection of materials for people to study on their own, or use in their own organisations.
BRIAN:                    Uhuh. You mean books and videos?
TUTOR:                   Yes, and manuals for self-study. Plus a lot of computer-based materials, so people can work through them at their own speed, and repeat anything they aren’t sure about. And you can hire
laptops
to use in your own home or workplace as well as
printers
that you can take away.
Q26/27
BRIAN:                    Does it have anything that I could use to improve my study skills? I don’t have much idea about
report writing
, and I’m sure I’ll need it on the course.
Q28
TUTOR:                   Oh yes, there’s plenty of useful material. Just ask one of the staff.
BRIAN:                    Does the centre cover all the main areas of business?
TUTOR:                   Yes, topics like finance, and of course
marketing
– that’s a popular one. Local managers seem to queue up to borrow the videos!
Q29
BRIAN:                    So it isn’t just for students, then?
TUTOR:                   No, it’s for members only, but anyone can join.
BRIAN:                    How much does it cost?
TUTOR:                   ￡100 a year for a company, and ￡50 for an
individual
, with no discount for students, I’m afraid.
Q30
BRIAN:                    That’s very helpful. Well, I think that’s all. I’d better go home and fill in the enrolment form. Thanks for all your help.
TUTOR:                   You’re welcome. Goodbye.
BRIAN:                    Goodbye.

剑桥雅思18 Test3 Part4
雅思听力
原文
In today’s astronomy lecture, I’m going to talk about the need for a system to manage the movement of satellites and other objects in orbit around the Earth. In other words, a SpaceTrafic Management system. We already have effective Air Traffic Control systems that are used internationally to ensure that planes navigate our skies safely. Well, Space TrafficManagement is a similar concept, but focusing on the control of satellites.
The aim of such a system would be to prevent the danger of collisions in space between the objects in orbit around the Earth. In order to do this, we’d need to have a set of legal measures, and we’d also have to develop the
technical (Q31)
systems to enable us to prevent such accidents.
But unfortunately, at present we don’t actually have a Space Traffic Management system that works. So why not? What are the problems in developing such a system?
Well, for one thing, satellites are relatively
cheap (Q32)
these days, compared with how they were in the past, meaning that more people can afford to put them into space. So there’s a lot more of them out there, and people aren’t just launching single satellites but whole constellations, consisting of
thousands (Q33)
of them designed to work together. So space is getting more crowded every day.
But in spite of this, one thing you may be surprised to leam is that you can launch a satellite into space and, once it’s out there, it doesn’t have to send back any information to Earth to allow its
identification (Q34)
. So while we have international systems for ensuring we know where the planes in our skies are, and to prevent them from colliding with one another, when it comes to the safety of satellites, at present we don’t have anything like enough proper ways of
tracking (Q35)
them.
And it isn’t just entire satellites that we need to consider. A greater threat is the huge amount of space debris in orbit around the Earth – broken bits of satellite and junk from space stations and so on. And some of these are so small that they can be very hard to identify, but they can still be very dangerous.
In addition, some operators,  may be unwilling to share information about the satellites they’ve launched. For example, a satellite may be designed for
military (Q36)
purposes, or it may have been launched for commercial reasons, and the operators don’t want competitors to have information about it.
And even if the operators are willing to provide it, the information isn’t easy to collect. Details are needed about the object itself as well as about its
location (Q37)
at a particular time – and remember that a satellite isn’t very big, and it’s likely to be moving at thousands of kilometers an hour. We don’t have any sensors that can constantly follow something moving so fast, so all that the scientists can do is to put forward a
prediction (Q38)
concerning where the satellite is heading next.
So those are some of the problems that we’re facing. Let’s consider now some of the solutions that have been suggested. One key issue is the way in which information is dealt with. We need more information, but it also needs to be accessible at a global level, so we need to establish shared standards that we can all agree on for the way in which this information is presented. We already do this in other areas of science, so although this is a challenge, it’s not an impossible task. Then, as all this information’s collected, it needs to be put together so it can be used, and that will involve creating a single
database (Q39)
on which it can be entered.
As we continue to push forward new developments, congestion of the space environment is only going to increase. To cope with this, we need to develop a system like the one I’ve described to coordinate the work of the numerous spacecraft operators, but it’s also essential that this system is one that establishes
trust (Q40)
in the people that use it, both nationally and at a global level.
One interesting development …

剑桥雅思10
test4 Section2
雅思听力
原文
Welcome to Manham Port, where a thousand years of history are brought to life.
All the family can enjoy a day out at Manham: visit our
copper
mine, see models of the machinery it used, have your photo taken in nineteenth-century costume, experience at first hand how people lived at different stages throughout history, and especially how children studied, worked and played.
The port of Manham is located in beautiful and peaceful countryside, on a bend in the great River Avon, and developed here because
it’s the highest navigable point of the Avon—boats can go no higher up this river—and proved a handy place to load and unload
cargo
to and from the sea (Q11)
, which is over 23 miles away.
A small port was already established here when, about 900 years ago,
tin
was discovered nearby, though
it wasn’t until the Industrial Revolution, when a
tremendous
need for metals of all kinds developed (Q12)
, that Manham expanded to become one of the busiest ports in the country.
And because it was already so busy, prospectors began to look for other minerals, and by the end of the nineteenth century, lead,
copper
, manganese and
arsenic
were added to the cargos leaving Manham.
In the early days, the ores had been smelted—or processed—in the same area they were mined.
But, as demand grew, the smelting process required huge factory furnaces or fires to melt the metal from the rock and
there was not enough coal in the local area, so the rocks containing minerals had to be shipped long distances (Q13)
.
Sadly,
in the twentieth century, the great port of Manham declined, and thousands of workers were forced to
emigrate
out of the area (Q14)
.
The building at the port fell into
disrepair
, and the place became almost forgotten.
But then, the Manham Trust was formed to conserve the historical resources of the area.
It organised scores of local volunteers to remove
undergrowth
to find the original outlines of the installations.
It then brought in paid professionals to match installations with maps of the original port complex
and to set about reconstructing it (Q15)
.
Today you can see the results of this
ambitious
programme of
restoration
.
The intention, and we believe this will be realised before the end of the year, is to return Manham Port to the condition it reached at its peak as ‘the greatest
copper
port in the country’.
But what can you do and see on your visit today?
Here are just a few highlights.
We suggest you start with the visit to the
copper
mine.
Travel on
converted
mining
trains (Q16)
and journey into the depths of the mountain along seams once worked by hundreds of miners.
Watch out especially for the great pumping machines which rid the mine of water.
But please be warned that, like all mines, ours is very
dark (Q17)
and dosed in and we do say that children under five and also dogs should NOT be taken into the mine.
The next recommended visit is to the village school.
While looking round the classrooms, take a special look at our display of
games (Q18)
, which is one of the largest in the world.
And it’s recommended that you time your visit to
coincide
with a
guided tour (Q19)
.
This will give you the opportunity to ask lots of questions.
Near the school is the beautiful old sailing
ketch
called ‘The George’.
You are welcome to board the boat and look round the cabins.
Look out for the ship’s wheel which was missing until only five years ago when it was dredged out of the
silt
by a local fisherman.
We have no idea how it got there but it’s been polished and proudly restored to its original place on the boat.
Please take care going down the
ladders (Q20)
if you wish to visit the lower deck—we don’t recommend you allow young children to use them.
So we hope you have a
memorable
visit to Manham Port and will tell your friends all about us.

剑桥雅思10Test4听力Section3答案解析 Laura‘s work placement
剑桥雅思10 test4 section3
雅思听力
原文
TIM
: Hi, Laura—could you spare a few minutes to talk about the work placement you did last summer?
I’m thinking of doing one myself…
LAURA
: Hi, Tim.
Sure.
TIM
: Didn’t you do yours at an environmental services company?
LAURA
: That’s right…
It’s only a very small company and they needed someone to produce a company brochure, and I wanted to get some business experience because I’m interested in a career in occupational
psychology
in a business environment.
It was good because I had overall responsibility for the project.
TIM
: What kind of skills do you think you developed on the placement?
I mean, apart from the ones you already had..
Did you have to do all the artwork for the brochure, the layout and everything?
LAURA
: We hired the services of a professional photographer for that.
I did have to use my IT skills to a certain extent because I cut and pasted text from marketing leaflets, but that didn’t involve anything I hadn’t done before.
TIM
:
Do you think you got any better at managing your time and prioritising things (Q21)
?
You always used to say you had trouble with that…
LAURA
: Oh, definitely.
There was so much pressure to meet the project deadline.
And I also got better at explaining things and asserting my opinions (Q22)
, because I had to have weekly consultations with the marketing manager and give him a progress report.
TIM
: It sounds as if you got a lot out of it then.
LAURA
: Absolutely.
It was really worthwhile …
But you know, the company benefited too…
TIM
: Yes, they must have done.
After all, if they’d used a professional advertising agency to produce their brochure instead of doing it in-house,
presumably
they’d have paid a lot more?
LAURA
: Oh, yes.
I worked it out—-
it would have been 250 per cent more (Q23)
.
And I thought the end result was good, even though we did everything on site.
The company has quite a powerful computer and I managed to borrow some scanning software from the university.
The new brochure looks really professional;
–
it enhances the image of the company straight away (Q24)
.
TIM
: So in the long run it should help them to attract clients, and improve their sales figures?
LAURA
: That’s the idea.
Yeah.
TIM
: Well, all in all it sounds very positive — I think I will go ahead and apply for a placement myself.
How do I go about it?
LAURA
: It’s easy enough to do, because there’s a government agency called STEP- S-T-E-P – that organises placements for students.
You should start by getting their
booklet
with all the details—I expect you can download one from their website.
TIM
: Actually,
they’ve got copies in the
psychology
department (Q25)
—I’ve seen them there, I’ll just go to the office and pick one up.
LAURA
: Right.
And then if I were you, after I’d looked at it I’d go over all the options with someone…
TIM
: I suppose I should ask my tutor’s advice.
He knows more about me than anyone.
LAURA
:
One of the career officers would be better (Q26)
, they’ve got more knowledge about the jobs market than your personal tutor would have.
TIM
: OK…
LAURA
: And then when you know what you want you can register with STEP—you’ll find their address in the
booklet
.
And once you’ve
registered
they assign you to a
mentor
who looks after your application.
TIM
: And then I suppose you just sit back and wait till you hear something?
LAURA
: They told me at the careers office that it’s best to be
proactive
, and
get updates yourself by checking the website for new placement alerts (Q27)
.
Your
mentor
is supposed to keep you informed, but you can’t rely on that.
TIM
: I don’t suppose it’s a good idea to get in touch with companies directly, is it?
LAURA
: Not really…
But it is the company who notifies you if they want you to go for an interview.
You get a letter of invitation or an email from personnel departments (Q28)
.
TIM
: And do I reply directly to them?
LAURA
: Yes, you do.
STEP only gets involved again once you’ve been made a job offer.
TIM
: Right…
So, once you’ve had an interview you should let your
mentor
know what the outcome is (Q29)
?
I mean whether you’re offered a job, and whether you’ve decided to accept it?
LAURA
: That’s right.
They’ll inform the careers office once a placement has been agreed, so you don’t have to do that.
TIM
: Is that all then?
LAURA
: More or less.
Only once you’ve accepted an offer you’ll probably have to supply a reference, because the placement will be conditional on that.
And
that’s something you should ask your own tutor to provide (Q30)
.
He knows about your academic ability and also about your qualities, like reliability.
TIM
: Well, thanks very much for the information—I’m starting to look forward…

剑桥雅思9 Test4 Section3
雅思听力
原文
MAN: Hello?
WOMAN: Hi. It’s Laura Carlton here. We’ve just arrived at the holiday flat, but I can’t get the hot water and heating to work.
MAN: Oh right! That’s easy. Don’t worry. In the upstairs cupboard, you’ll find the water heater. You’ll see three main controls on the left at the bottom of the heater.
The first one – the round one on the far left – is the most important one for the heating and hot water. It’s the main control switch (Q11)
. Make sure it’s in the ‘on’ position. The switch itself doesn’t light up, but the little square below will be black if the switch is ‘off’. That’s probably what’s happened – it’s got switched off by mistake. The middle one of these three controls – you’ll see it’s slightly larger than the first one – controls the radiators. If you feel cold while you’re there and need the radiators on, this needs to be turned to maximum. The last of the three controls – the one on the right – is usually on about a number four setting which for the water in the taps is usually quite hot enough.
Below the heating controls in the middle is a small round plastic button (Q12)
. If there isn’t enough water in the pipes, sometimes the heater goes out.
If this happens you’ll need to press this button to reset the heater (Q12)
. Hold it in for about five seconds and the heater should come on again. Then there’s
a little square indicator under the third knob that’s a kind of alarm light (Q13)
. It’llflash if you need to reset the heater.
WOMAN: It sounds complicated …
MAN: I’m sure you won’t have any problems with it. There should be some more instructions on the side of the heater. Call me back if you can’t make it work.
WOMAN: Okay.
WOMAN: While you’re on the phone, we haven’t managed to find a few things we need, like extra pillows for the beds and some washing powder. Is there any here?
MAN: Pillows … yes.
If you look in the cupboard, the large white one upstairs – to the left of the bathroom door (Q14)
– there should be four or five on the top shelf. And if you want to do some washing,
there’s some powder for that… probably by the back door. There’s a kind of shelf there above the sink (Q15)
. In fact, I’m sure there’s some there, in a large blue box. You need about half a cup full for each wash.
And that reminds me,
the spare key to the back door is hanging on a hook
on the wall by the sitting room window (Q16)
. Please make sure to put it back when you’ve used it. The previous guests lost it in the garden and I had to get another one made!  And if you have any trouble with the lamps, you’ll find
some spare bulbs in a large cardboard box. It’s on top of the washing machine (Q17)
with all kinds of useful things in it.
Oh, and another thing I forgot to mention when we last spoke …
WOMAN: Yes?
MAN:
I’ve left you a local map (Q18)
, so you’ll be able to find your way around easily. It shows the whole area. I put it
in the top drawer of the chest (Q18)
under the TV in your bedroom. There’s a whole file of local information in there too.
WOMAN: Thanks. What about visiting the town? Can you give us any advice?
MAN: Yes. You’ll need to take the car. It’s too far to walk from the flat really. You have to pay to leave your car in all the car parks now I’m afraid … I like the one that’s by the station best and you can walk to the town centre from there in five minutes. That’s where all the best restaurants are. But if you want a takeaway, the Italian one does really good pasta and pizzas. Call
7-3 double 2-8-1 (Q19)
for that one, or 7 double 6, double 1, 9 for the Chinese. They’re both good and they’ll both deliver to the flat.
As for places to visit, yes, do go and see the railway museum. The exhibition is small but really good. It gets very crowded on Sundays, so I suggest you visit it on a quieter day, later in the week, but not on
Thursdays (Q20)
which is market day – you won’t find anywhere to park and it’s also the only day of the week when they’re not open! Anything else?
WOMAN: Not for the moment. Thanks!

On behalf of LP Clubs, I’d like to welcome you all here today.
My name’s Sandy Fisher and I’m one of the fitness managers here.
Before we start our tour of the club I’ll just run through some basic information about the facilities we
have here, including recent improvements, and explain the types of membership available.
Our greatest asset is probably
our swimming pool which at 25 metres isn’t Olympic-sized, but
now we’ve expanded it to eight lanes, it’s much wider (Q11)
.
This means there are rarely more than a couple of people at a time in each lane.
Unfortunately, there isn’t space for an outdoor pool here but the glass roof on the swimming pool is
partly
retractable
, which means you can enjoy something of the open-air experience on warmer days.
Our recently refurbished fitness
suite (Q12)
has all the latest exercise equipment including ten new
running machines and a wide range of weight-training machines. 
Each member is given full training in how to operate the equipment and there is always a trainer on duty
to offer help and advice.
Although we do have adult-only times after 6 and at certain times at weekends, children are well catered
for.
Older children continue to benefit from a wide range of tuition; anything from trampolining to yoga.
One thing all our members appreciate about us is that we take very good care of them.
This starts on day one with your personal
assessment
.
You are asked to fill in a
questionnaire
giving details of any
health
problems
(Q13)
.
One of our personal trainers will then go through this with you.
The trainer will then take you through the
safety rules (Q14)
for using the equipment in the fitness
suite
.
During your next exercise session a personal trainer will work with you to make sure you understand
these.
It’s very important to do this because we really do want to avoid having any sports injuries.
There’s a lot more to looking after yourself than simply lifting weights!
At the end of the personal
assessment
, the trainer will draw up a
plan (Q15)
, outlining what you should try to
achieve within a six-week period.
This will then be reviewed at the end of the six weeks.
Now, I’ll just quickly run through the types of membership we have available.
All members must pay a
joining (Q16)
fee of £90 in addition to the rates for the monthly membership fees.
Gold membership entitles you to
free entry
(Q17)
at all LP Clubs.
There are now LP clubs in all major cities and towns so if you travel a lot this will be a great advantage.
Individual gold membership costs £50 a month and joint membership for you and your partner will cost
£75.
Premier membership is for professional people whose work commitments make it difficult for them to
use the club during the day and so LP gives booking preferences to Premier members at
peak
(Q18)
times.
This means you will find it easier to book the sessions at times that suit you.
Reciprocal
arrangements with other LP Clubs are available to Premier members.
Premier membership is for individuals only, but you will be sent passes for
guests
(Q19)
every month.
The monthly fee is £65.
You don’t have to have any special clothes or equipment when you visit the club.
We provide robes and hairdryers in the changing rooms, but it’s very important to remember your
photo
card
(Q20)
because you won’t be able to get in without it.
For people who aren’t working during the day then…

剑桥雅思10Test4Section4听力答案解析 Nanotechnology: technology on a small scale
剑桥雅思10 test4 section4
雅思听力
原文
Today we’re going to look at an important area of science, namely
nanotechnology
.
So what is it?
Nano means tiny, so it’s science and engineering on the scale of atoms and molecules.
The idea is that by controlling and rearranging atoms, you can literally create anything.
However, as we’ll see, the science of the small has some big implications affecting us in many ways.
There’s no doubt that
nanotechnology
promises so much for civilisation.
However, all new technologies have their teething problems.
And with
nanotechnology
, society often gets the wrong idea about its capabilities (Q31)
.
Numerous science-fiction books and movies have raised people’s fears about
nanotechnology
– with scenarios such as inserting little nano-robots into your body that monitor everything you do without you realising it, or self-replicating nano-robots that
eventually
take over the world.
So how do we
safeguard
such a potentially powerful technology?
Some scientists recommend that nano-particles be treated as new chemicals with separate safety tests and dear labelling (Q32)
.
They believe that greater care should also be taken with nano-particles in laboratories and factories.
Others have called for a
withdrawal
of new nano products such as cosmetics and a temporary
halt
to many kinds of nanotech research.
But as far as I’m concerned there’s a need to
plough
ahead with the discoveries and applications of
nanotechnology (Q33)
.
I really believe that most scientists would welcome a way to guard against
unethical
uses of such technology.
We can’t go around thinking that all
innovation
is bad, all advancement is bad.
As with the debate about any new technology, it is how you use it that’s important.
So let’s look at some of its possible uses.
Thanks to
nanotechnology
, there could be a major
breakthrough
in the field of transportation with the production of more
durable
metals (Q34)
.
These could be
virtually
unbreakable, lighter and much more
pliable
leading to planes that are 50 times lighter than at present.
Those same improved capabilities will
dramatically
reduce the cost of travelling into
space (Q35)
making it more
accessible
to ordinary people and opening up a totally new holiday destination.
In terms of technology, the computer industry will be able to
shrink
computer parts down to minute sizes.
We need
nanotechnology
in order to create a new generation of computers that will work even faster and will have a million times more
memory (Q36)
but will be about the size of a sugar cube.
Nanotechnology
could also
revolutionise
the way that we
generate
power.
The cost of
solar (Q37)
cells will be
drastically
reduced so harnessing this energy will be far more economical than at present.
But
nanotechnology
has much wider applications than this and could have an enormous impact on our environment.
For
instance
, tiny
airborne
nano-robots could be programmed to actually rebuild the
ozone
layer, which could lessen the impact of global warming on our planet.
That’s a pretty amazing thought, isn’t it?
On a more local scale, this new technology could help with the clean-up of environmental disasters as
nanotechnology
will allow us to remove
oil (Q38)
and other contaminants from the water far more effectively.
And, if
nanotechnology
progresses as expected —as a sort of building block set of about 90 atoms—then you could build anything you wanted from the bottom up.
In terms of production, this means that you only use what you need and so there wouldn’t be any
waste (Q39)
.
The
notion
that you could create anything at all has major implications for our health.
It means that we’ll
eventually
be able to replicate anything.
This would have a
phenomenal
effect on our society.
In time it could even lead to the
eradication
of
famine
through the introduction of machines that produce food to feed the hungry.
But it’s in the area of medicine that
nanotechnology
may have its biggest impact.
How we
detect
disease will change as  tiny
biosensors
are developed to analyse
tests (Q40)
in minutes rather than days.
There’s even
speculation
nano-robots could be used to slow the ageing process, lengthening life expectancy.
As you can see, I’m very excited by the implications that could be available to us in the next few decades.
Just how long it’ll take, I honestly don’t know.

原文
In today’s class I’m going to talk about marine archaeology, the branch of archaeology focusing on human interaction with the sea, lakes and rivers. It’s the study of ships, cargoes, shipping facilities, and other physical remains. I’ll give you an example, then go on to show how this type of research is being transformed by the use of the latest technology.
Atlit-Yam was a village on the coast of the eastern Mediterranean, which seems to have been thriving until around 7,000 BC. The residents kept cattle, caught fish and stored grain. They had wells for fresh water, many of their houses were built around a courtyard and were constructed of stone. The village contained an impressive monument: seven half-tonne stones standing in a semicircle around a
spring (Q31)
, that might have been used for ceremonial purposes.
Atlit-Yam may have been destroyed swiftly by a tsunami, or climate change may have caused glaciers to melt and sea levels to rise, flooding the village gradually. Whatever the cause, it now lies ten metres below the surface of the Mediterranean, buried under sand at the bottom of the sea. It’s been described as the largest and best preserved prehistoric settlement ever found on the seabed.
For marine archaeologists, Atlit-Yam is a treasure trove. Research on the buildings,
tools (Q32)
and the human remains has revealed how the bustling village once functioned, and even what diseases some of its residents suffered from. But of course this is only one small village, one window into a lost world. For a fuller picture, researchers need more sunken settlements, but the hard part is finding them.
Underwater research used to require divers to find shipwrecks or artefacts, but in the second half of the twentieth century, various types of underwater vehicles were developed, some controlled from a ship on the surface, and some of them autonomous, which means they don’t need to be operated by a person.
Autonomous underwater vehicles, or AUVs, are used in the oil industry, for instance, to create
maps (Q33)
of the seabed before rigs and pipelines are installed. To navigate they use sensors, such as compasses and sonar. Until relatively recently they were very expensive, and so
heavy (Q34)
that they had to be launched from a large vessel with a winch.
But the latest AUVs are much easier to manoeuvre – they can be launched from the shore or a small ship. And they’re much cheaper, which makes them more accessible to research teams. They’re also very sophisticated. They can communicate with each other and, for example, work out the most efficient way to survey a site, or to find particular objects on the seabed.
Field tests show the approach can work. For example, in a trial in 2015, three AUVs searched for wrecks at Marzamemi, off the coast of Sicily. The site is the final resting place of an ancient Roman ship, which sank in the sixth century AD while ferrying prefabricated
marble (Q35)
elements for the construction of an early church. The AUVs mapped the area in detail, finding other ships carrying columns of the same material.
Creating an internet in the sea for AUVs to communicate is no easy matter. Wifi networks on land use electromagnetic waves, but in water these will only travel a few centimetres. Instead, a more complex mix of technologies is required. For short distances, AUVs can share data using
light (Q36)
, while acoustic waves are used to communicate over long distances. But more creative solutions are also being developed, where an AUV working on the seabed offloads data to a second AUV, which then surfaces and beams the data home to the research team using a satellite.
There’s also a system that enables AUVs to share information from seabed scans, and other data. So if an AUV surveying the seabed finds an intriguing object, it can share the coordinates of the object – that is, its position – with a nearby AUV that carries superior
cameras (Q37)
, and arrange for that AUV to make a closer inspection of the object.
Marine archaeologists are excited about the huge potential of these AUVs for their discipline. One site where they’re going to be deployed is the Gulf of Baratti, off the Italian coast. In 1974, a 2,000-year-old Roman vessel was discovered here, in 18 metres of water. When it sank, it was carrying
medical (Q38)
goods, in wooden or tin receptacles. Its cargo gives us insight into the treatments available all those years ago, including tablets that are thought to have been dissolved to form a cleansing liquid for the
eyes (Q39)
.
Other Roman ships went down nearby, taking their cargoes with them. Some held huge pots made of terracotta. Some were used for transporting cargoes of olive oil, and others held
wine (Q40)
. In many cases it’s only these containers that remain, while the wooden ships have been buried under silt on the seabed.
Another project that’s about to …

雅思听力
原文
WOMAN:       I’ve been reading your personal statement, Paul. First, let’s talk about your work experience in South America. What took you there? Was it to gain more fluency in Spanish?
PAUL:         Well, as I’m combining Spanish with Latin American studies, my main idea was
to find out more about the way people lived there (Q21)
. My spoken Spanish was already pretty good in fact.
WOMAN:       So you weren’t too worried about language barriers?
PAUL:         No. In fact, I ended up teaching English there, although that wasn’t my original choice of work.
WOMAN:       I see. How did you find out about all this?
PAUL:         I found an agency that runs all kinds of voluntary projects in South America.
WOMAN:       What kind of work?
PAUL:         Well, there were several possibilities.
WOMAN:       YOU mean construction? Engineering work?
PAUL:         Yes, getting involved in building projects was an option. Then there was
tourism – taking tourists for walks around the volcanoes – which I actually chose to do (Q22)
, and then there was work with local farmers.
WOMAN:       But you didn’t continue with that project. Why not?
PAUL:         Because I never really knew whether I’d be needed or not. I’d thought it might be difficult physically, but I was certainly fit enough. . . no,
I wanted to do something that had more of a proper structure to it (Q23)
, I suppose. I get de-motivated otherwise.
WOMAN:       What do you think you learned from your experience? It must have been a great opportunity to examine community life.
PAUL:         Yes, but it was difficult at first to be accepted by the locals. It was a very remote village and some of them were reluctant to speak to me – although they were always interested in my clothes and how much I’d had to pay for them.
WOMAN:       Well, that’s understandable.
PAUL:         Yes, but things soon improved.
What struck me was that when people became more comfortable with me and less suspicious (Q24)
, we really connected with each other in a meaningful way.
WOMAN:       YOU made good friends?
PAUL:         Yes, with two of the families in particular.
WOMAN:       Good. What about management. Did you have a project manager?
PAUL:         Yes and
he gave me lots of advice and guidance (Q25)
.
WOMAN:       And was he good at managing too?
PAUL:         That wasn’t his strong point! I think he was often more interested in the academic side of things than filing reports. He was a bit of a dreamer.
WOMAN:       And did you have a contract?
PAUL:         I had to stay for a minimum of three months. My parents were surprised when I asked to stay longer – six months in the end. I was so happy there.
WOMAN:       And did anything on the administration side of things surprise you? What was the food and lodging like?
PAUL:         Simple. . . but there was plenty to eat and I only paid seven dollars a day for that which was amazing really. And they gave me all the equipment I needed. . .
even a laptop
.
WOMAN:
You didn’t expect that then?
PAUL:
NO  (Q26)
.
WOMAN:       Well, I’ll look forward to hearing more.
WOMAN:       But now let’s look at these modules. You’ll need to start thinking about which ones you’ll definitely want to study. The first one here is Gender Studies in Latin America.
PAUL:         Mmm. . .
WOMAN:       It looks at how gender analysis is reconfiguring civil society in Latin America. Women are increasingly occupying positions in government and in other elected leadership positions in Latin America. I think you’d find it interesting.
PAUL:
If it was to do with people in the villages rather than those in the public sphere, I would (Q27)
.
WOMAN:       Okay. What about Second Language Acquisition?
PAUL:         Do you think rd find that useful?
WOMAN:       Well, you’ve had some practical experience in the field, I think it would be.
PAUL:         I hadn’t thought about that.
I’ll put that down as a definite, then (Q28)
.
WOMAN:       Okay. What about Indigenous Women’s Lives. That sounds appropriate.
PAUL:         I thought so too, but I looked at last year’s exam questions and that changed my mind.
WOMAN:       Don’t judge the value of the course on that. Maybe, talk to some other students first
and we can talk about it again later (Q29)
.
PAUL:
Okay.
WOMAN:       Yes. And lastly, will you sign up for Portuguese lessons?
PAUL:         My Spanish is good, so would I find that module easy?
WOMAN:       Not necessarily. Some people find that Spanish interferes with learning Portuguese. . . getting the accent right too. It’s quite different in a lot of ways.
PAUL:
Well, I’d much sooner do something else, then. (Q30)
WOMAN:       Alright. Now, what we need to do is. . .

原文
Yong Man:
That seminar yesterday on automation and the future of work was really good, wasn’t it? Looking at the first industrial revolution in Britain in the 19th century and seeing how people reacted to massive change was a real eye-opener.
Yong Woman:
Yes. It was interesting to hear how people felt about automation then and what challenges they faced. I didn’t know that first started with workers in the textile industry.
Yong Man:
With those protesting workers called the Luddites destroying their knitting machines because they were so worried about losing their jobs.
Yong Woman:
Yes, and
ultimately, they didn’t achieve anything (Q21)
. And anyway, industrialization created more jobs than it destroyed.
Yong Man:
Yes, that’s true – but it probably didn’t seem a positive thing at the time.
I can see why the Luddites felt so threatened (Q22).
Yong Woman:
I know. I’m sure I would have felt the same. The discussion about the future of work was really optimistic for a change. I like the idea that work won’t involve doing boring, repetitive tasks, as robots will do all that. Normally, you only hear negative stuff about the future.
Yong Man:
Bit too optimistic, don’t you think? For example, I can’t see how people are about to have more leisure time, when
all the evidence shows people are spending longer than ever at work (Q23)
.
Yong Woman:
No – that’s true. And
what about lower unemployment? I’m not so sure about that (Q24)
.
Yong Man:
Perhaps in the long term – but not in the foreseeable future.
Yong Woman:
Mmm. And I expect most people will be expected to work until they’re much older – as everyone’s living much longer.
Yong Man:
That’s already happening.
Yong Woman:
I enjoyed all that stuff on how technology has changed some jobs and how they’re likely to change in the near future.
Yong Man:
Yeah, incredible. Like accountants. You might think all the technological innovations would have put them out of a job,
but in fact there are more of them than ever. They’re still really in demand and have become far more efficient (Q25)
.
Yong Woman:
Right. That was amazing. Twenty times more accountants in this country compared to the 19th century.
Yong Man:
I know. I’d never have thought that demand for hairdressing would have gone up so much in the last hundred years. One hairdresser for every 287 people now, compared to one for over 1,500.
Yong Woman:
Yeah
because people’s earning power has gone up so they can afford to spend more on personal services like that (Q26)
.
Yong Man:
But technology hasn’t changed the actual job that much.
Yong Woman:
No, they’ve got hairdryers, etc. but it’s one job where you don’t depend on a computer … The kind of work that administrative staff do has changed enormously, thanks to technology. Even 20 years ago there were secretaries doing dictation and typing.
Yong Man:
Yes.
Really boring compared to these days when they’re given much more responsibility and higher status (Q27)
.
Yong Woman:
Mmm. A lot of graduates go in for this kind of work now … I’d expected there to be a much bigger change in the number of agricultural workers in the 19th century. But the 1871 census showed that roughly 25% of the population worked on the land.
Yong Man:
Yeah,
I’d have assumed it would be more than 50%. Now it’s less than 0.2% (Q28)
.
Yong Woman:
What about care workers?
Yong Man:
They barely existed in the 19th century as people’s lifespan was so much shorter.
But now of course this sector will see huge growth (Q29)
.
Yong Woman:
Yeah – and it’s hard enough to meet current demand. The future looks quite bleak for bank clerks. They’ve been in decline since ATMs were introduced in the eighties.
Yong Man:
And
technology will certainly make most of the jobs they do now redundant, I think (Q30)
.
Yong Woman:
I agree, although the situation may change. It’s very hard to predict what will happen.

剑桥雅思7Test4听力Section4答案解析 Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)
剑7 test 4 Section 4
雅思听力
原文
In today’s lecture, I’m going to talk about Monosodium Glutamate, or MSG, as it’s more commonly known. Now, MSG as you probably know, is a flavour enhancer which is used particularly in Chinese and Japanese cooking. Today I am going to explore why it is so popular in these cuisines and, more importantly,
how does it enhance the flavour of food
?
Q31
The main reason why MSG is more commonly used in Japanese meals is tradition. For many thousands of years the Japanese have incorporated a type of seaweed known as kombu in their cooking, as they discovered it had the ability to make food taste better. But it wasn’t until 1908 that the ingredient in kombu which was responsible for the improvement in flavour was
actually discovered to be glutamate
by scientists working there.
Q32
From 1908 until 1956, glutamate was produced commercially in Japan by a very slow and expensive means of extraction. It was in 1956 that the speed of the process was improved, and
industrial production increased dramatically
and still continues to increase to this day.
Q33
In fact, hundreds of thousands of tonnes of MSG are produced all over the world today.
So what exactly is MSG? Well, Monosodium Glutamate contains seventy-eight point two per cent glutamate, twelve point two per cent sodium and
nine point six per cent water
.
Q34
Glutamate is an amino acid that can be found naturally in all protein-containing foods, erm, so this includes food such as
meat and cheese
.
Q35 Q36
It is widely known that Chinese and Japanese food contains MSG but many people don’t seem to be aware that it is also used in foods in other parts of the world. For example it is found in commercially made Italian pizzas, in American fast food and in Britain MSG is used in things like potato crisps.
So, how exactly does MSG work? Well, in the Western world, we commonly talk of four ‘tastes’, and I’m sure you’re all familiar with the concepts of sweet, sour, bitter and salt. Well, in 1908, Kikunae Ikeda
identified a fifth ‘taste’
. And it is thought that MSG intensifies this naturally occurring ‘taste’ in some food. It does make perfect evolutionary sense that we should have the ability to detect or taste glutamate because
it is the amino acid which is most common in natural foods
.
Q37 Q38
John Prescott, an associate professor at the University of Chicago, suggests that this fifth taste serves a purpose just as the other tastes do. He suggests that it signals to us the presence of protein in food, in the same way that sweetness indicates that a food contains energy-giving carbohydrates.
Bitterness
, he says, alerts us of toxins in the food, while sourness warns us of spoilage and
saltiness signals the presence of minerals
.
Q39 Q40
So, what else do we know about this fifth taste…

剑桥雅思15Test2Part4听力答案解析 Agricultural programme in Mozambique
剑桥雅思15 test2 part4
雅思听力
原文
I’m going to report on a case study of a programme which has been set up to help rural populations in Mozambique, a largely agricultural country in South-East Africa.
The programme worked with three communities in Chicualacuala district, near the Limpopo River. This is a dry and arid region, with unpredictable rainfall. Because of this, people in the area were unable to support themselves through agriculture and instead they used the forest as a means of providing themselves with an income, mainly by selling charcoal. However, this was not a sustainable way of living in the long term, as they were rapidly using up this resource.
To support agriculture in this dry region, the programme focused primarily on making use of existing water resources from the Limpopo River by setting up systems of
irrigation (Q31)
, which would provide a dependable water supply for crops and animals. The programme worked closely with the district government in order to find the best way of implementing this. The region already had one farmers’ association, and it was decided to set up two more of these. These associations planned and carried out activities including water management, livestock breeding and agriculture, and it was notable that in general,
women (Q32)
formed the majority of the workforce.
It was decided that in order to keep the crops safe from animals, both wild and domestic, special areas should be fenced off where the crops could be grown. The community was responsible for creating these fences, but the programme provided the necessary
wire (Q33)
for making them.
Once the area had been fenced off, it could be cultivated. The land was dug, so that vegetables and cereals appropriate to the climate could be grown, and the programme provided the necessary
seeds (Q34)
for this. The programme also provided pumps so that water could be brought from the river in pipes to the fields. However, the labour was all provided by local people, and they also provided and put up the
posts (Q35)
that supported the fences around the fields.
Once the programme had been set up, its development was monitored carefully. The farmers were able to grow enough produce not just for their own needs, but also to sell. However, getting the produce to places where it could be marketed was sometimes a problem, as the farmers did not have access to
transport (Q36)
, and this resulted in large amounts of produce, especially vegetables, being spoiled. This problem was discussed with the farmers’ associations and it was decided that in order to prevent food from being spoiled, the farmers needed to learn techniques for its
preservation (Q37)
.
There was also an additional initiative that had not been originally planned,but which became a central feature of the programme. This was when farmers started to dig holes for tanks in the fenced-off areas and to fill these with water and use them for breeding
fish (Q38)
– an important source of protein. After a time, another suggestion was made by local people which hadn’t been part of the programme’s original proposal, but which was also adopted later on. They decided to try setting up colonies of
bees
(Q39)
, which would provide honey both for their own consumption and to sell.
So what lessons can be learned from this programme? First of all, it tells us that in dry, arid regions, if there is access to a reliable source of water, there is great potential for the development of agriculture. In Chicualacuala, there was a marked improvement in agricultural production, which improved food security and benefited local people by providing them with both food and income. However, it’s important to set realistic timelines for each phase of the programme, especially for its
design (Q40)
, as mistakes made at this stage may be hard to correct later on.
The programme demonstrates that sustainable development is possible in areas where …

剑桥雅思15 test3 Part3
雅思听力
原文
HAZEL:
Tom, could I ask you for some advice, please?
TOM:
Yes of course, if you think I can help. What’s it about?
HAZEL:
It’s my first media studies assignment, and I’m not sure how to go about it. You must have done it last year.
TOM:
Is that the one comparing the coverage of a particular story in a range of newspapers?
HAZEL:
That’s right.
TOM:
Oh yes, I really enjoyed writing it.
HAZEL:
So what sort of things do I need to compare?
TOM:
Well, there are several things. For example, there’s the question of which
page (Q21)
of the newspaper the item appears on.
HAZEL:
You mean, because there’s a big difference between having it on the front page and the bottom of page ten, for instance?
TOM:
Exactly. And that shows how important the editor thinks the story is. Then there’s the
size (Q22
)
– how many column inches the story is given, how many columns it spreads over.
HAZEL:
And I suppose that includes the headline
TOM:
It certainly does. It’s all part of attracting the reader’s attention.
HAZEL:
What about
graphics (Q23)
– whether there’s anything visual in addition to the text?
TOM:
Yes, you need to consider those, too, because they can have a big effect on the reader’s understanding of the story – sometimes a bigger effect than the text itself. Then you’ll need to look at how the item is put together: what
structure (Q24)
is it given? Bear in mind that not many people read beyond the first paragraph so what has the journalist put at the beginning? And if, say, there are conflicting opinions about something, does one appear near the end, where people probably won’t read it?
HAZEL:
And newspapers sometimes give wrong or misleading information, don’t they? Either deliberately or by accident. Should I be looking at that, too?
TOM:
Yes, if you can. Compare what’s in different versions, and as far as possible, try and work out what’s true and what isn’t. And that relates to a very important point: what’s the writer’s
purpose (Q25)
, or at least the most important one, if they have several. It may seem to be to inform the public, but often it’s that they want to create fear, or controversy, or to make somebody look ridiculous
HAZEL:
Gosh, I see what you mean. And I suppose the writer may make
assumptions (Q26)
about the reader.
TOM:
That’s right – about their knowledge of the subject, their attitudes, and their level of education, which means writing so that the readers understand without feeling patronised. All of that will make a difference to how the story is presented.
HAZEL:
Does it matter what type of story I write about?
TOM:
No – national or international politics, the arts … Anything, as long as it’s covered in two or three newspapers. Though of course it’ll be easier and more fun if it’s something you’re interested in and know something about.
HAZEL:
And on that basis a national news item would be worth analysing-I’m quite keen on politics,
so I’ll try and find a suitable topic (Q27)
. What did you choose for your analysis, Tom?
TOM:
I was interested in how newspapers express their opinions explicitly, so
I wanted to compare editorials in different papers, but when I started looking, I couldn’t find two on the same topic (Q28)
that I felt like analysing.
HAZEL:
In that case, I won’t even bother to look.
TOM:
So in the end I chose a human interest story – a terribly emotional story about a young girl who was very ill, and lots of other people – mostly strangers – raised money so she could go abroad for treatment. Actually, I was surprised – some papers just wrote about how wonderful everyone was, but others considered the broader picture, like why treatment wasn’t available here.
HAZEL:
Hmm,
I usually find stories like that raise quite strong feelings in me! I’ll avoid that (Q29)
.
Perhaps I’ll choose an arts topic (Q30)
, like different reviews of a film, or something about funding for the arts – I’ll think about that.
TOM:
Yes, that might be interesting.
HAZEL:
OK, well thanks a lot for your help, Tom. It’s been really useful.
TOM:
You’re welcome. Good luck with the assignment, Hazel.

剑桥雅思16 Test1 Part2
雅思听力
原文
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Stevenson’s, one of the country’s major manufacturers of metal goods. Thank you for choosing us for your two weeks of work experience. My name is Julia Simmons, and since the beginning of this year I’ve been the managing director.
Stevenson’s is quite an old company. Like me, the founder, Ronald Stevenson, went into the steel industry when he left school – that was in 1923.
He set up this company when he finished his apprenticeship, in 1926 (Q11)
, although he actually started making plans two years earlier, in 1924. He was a very determined young man!
Stevenson’s long-term plan was to manufacture components for the machine tools industry although in fact that never came about – and for the automotive industry, that is, cars and lorries. However, there was a delay of five years before that happened, because shortly before the company went into production,
Stevenson was given the opportunity to make goods for hospitals and other players in the healthcare industry so that’s what we did for the first five years (Q12)
.
Over the years, we’ve expanded the premises considerably – we were lucky that the site is big enough, so
moving to a new location has never been necessary
. However, the layout is far from ideal for modern machinery and production methods, so we
intend to carry out major refurbishment of this site (Q13)
over the next five years.
I’d better give you some idea of what you’ll be doing during your two weeks with us, so you know what to expect.
Most mornings you’ll have a presentation from one of the managers (Q14)
, to learn about their department, starting this morning with research and development. And you’ll all spend some time in each department, observing what’s going on and talking to people – as long as you don’t stop them from doing their work altogether! In the past, a teacher from your school has come in at the end of each week to find out how the group were getting on, but your school isn’t able to arrange that this year.
OK, now I’ll briefly help you to orientate yourselves around the site. As you can see, we’re in the reception area, which we try to make attractive and welcoming to visitors. There’s a corridor running left from here, and
if you go along that. the door facing you at the end is the entrance to the coffee room. This looks out onto the main road on one side, and some trees on the other (Q15)
, and that’ll be where you meet each morning.
The factory is the very big room on the far side of the site. Next to it is
the warehouse, which can be accessed by lorries going up the road to the turning area at the end. You can get to the warehouse by crossing to the far side of the courtyard, and then the door is on your right (Q16)
.
Somewhere you’ll be keen to find is the
staff canteen. This is right next to reception
. I can confidently say that the food’s very good, but the view isn’t.
The windows on one side look onto a corridor and courtyard
, which aren’t very attractive at all, and
on the other onto the access road (Q17)
, which isn’t much better.
You’ll be using the meeting room quite often, and
you’ll find it by walking along the corridor to the left of the courtyard and continuing along it to the end. The meeting room is the last one on the right (Q18)
, and I’m afraid there’s no natural daylight in the room.
Then you’ll need to know where some of the offices are.
The human resources department is at the front of this building, so you head to the left along the corridor from reception, and it’s the second room you come to. It looks out onto the main road (Q19)
.
And finally, the boardroom, where you’ll be meeting sometimes. That has quite a pleasant view, as
it looks out on to the trees. Go along the corridor past the courtyard, right to the end. The boardroom is on the left, next to the factory (Q20)
.
OK, now are there any questions before we…

原文
Hi. Great to see you! I’m Jody, and I’ll be looking after both of you for the first month you’re working here at the Amersham Theatre. I’ll tell you something about the theatre now, then take you to meet two of the other staff.
It’s an old building, and it’s been modernised several times. In fact, as you can see, we’re carrying out a major refurbishment at the moment. The interior has just been repainted, and we’re about to start on the exterior of the building – that’ll be a big job. The work’s running over budget, so we’ve had to postpone installing an elevator. I hope you’re happy running up and down stairs! When the theatre was built, people were generally slimmer and shorter than now, and the seats were very close together.
We’ve replaced them with larger seats, with more legroom (Q11)
. This means fewer seats in total, but we’ve taken the opportunity to install seats that can easily be moved, to create different acting spaces.
We’ve also turned a few storerooms over to other purposes, like using them for meetings (Q12)
.
We try hard to involve members of the public in the theatre.
One way is by organising backstage tours (Q13)
, so people can be shown round the building and learn how a theatre operates. These are proving very popular. What we’re finding is that people want to have lunch or a cup of coffee while they’re here, so we’re looking into the possibility of opening a café in due course.
We have a bookshop (Q14)
, which specialises in books about drama, and that attracts plenty of customers. Then there are two large rooms that will be decorated next month, and they’ll be available for hire, for conferences and private functions, such as parties. We’re also considering hiring out costumes to amateur drama clubs.
Now I want to tell you about our workshops. We recently started a programme of workshops that anyone can join. Eventually we intend to run courses in acting, but we’re waiting until we’ve got the right people in place as trainers. That’s proving more difficult than we’d expected! There’s a big demand to learn about the technical side of putting on a production, and
our lighting workshop has already started, with great success (Q15)
. We’re going to start one on sound next month. A number of people have enquired about workshops on make-up, and that’s something we’re considering for the future.
A surprise success is the workshop on making puppets (Q16)
– we happen to have someone working here who does it as a hobby, and she offered to run a workshop. It was so popular we’re now running them every month!
Now, a word about the layout of the building. The auditorium, stage and dressing rooms for the actors are all below ground level. Here on the ground floor we have most of the rooms that the public doesn’t see. The majority are internal, so they have windows in the roof to light them.
Standing here in the foyer, you’re probably wondering why the box office isn’t here, where the public would expect to find it. Well, you might have noticed it on your way in –
although it’s part of this building, it’s next door, with a separate entrance from the road (Q17)
.
For the
theatre manager’s office, you go across the foyer and through the double doors, turn right, and it’s the room at the end of the corridor, with the door on the left (Q18)
.
The lighting box is where the computerised stage lighting is operated, and it’s at the back of the building.
When you’re through the double doors, turn left, turn right at the water cooler, and right again at the end (Q19)
. It’s the second room along that corridor. The lighting box has a window into the auditorium, which of course is below us.
The artistic director’s office is through the double doors, turn right, and it’s the first room you come to on the right-hand side (Q20)
. And finally, for the moment, the room where I’ll take you next – the relaxation room. So if you’d like to come with me …

剑6 test 1 Section 2
雅思听力
原文
MAN: And here on Radio Rivenden we have Lynne Rawley, the Public Relations Officer of our own Rivenden City Theatre. Hello, Lynne.
LYNNE: Hello.
MAN: Now, the theatre is reopening soon after its three-year redevelopment programme, isn’t it?
LYNNE: That’s right, and there are a lot of improvements. The first thing people will see when they go in is that the foyer has been repainted in the original green and gold. Then
the box office has been reoriented, with its own access from the side of the building
instead of through the foyer, which means it can be open longer hours, and has more space, too. The shop that used to be in the foyer, which sold books and CDs, is the one part of the redevelopment which isn’t yet complete. The plan is to find new premises for it near the theatre, and we’ve had difficulty finding somewhere suitable.
We hope to reopen the shop in the next few months
.
Q11  Q12
MAN: Will audiences find any difference in the auditorium?
LYNNE: Yes, we’ve increased the leg-room between the rows. This means that
there are now fewer seats
but we’re sure audiences will be much happier. And we’ve installed air conditioning, so it won’t get so hot and stuffy. We already had a few seats which were suitable for wheelchair users, and
now there are twice as many
, which we hope will meet demand. Something else that will benefit audiences is the
new lifts. The two we used to have were very small and slow. They’ve now gone, and we’ve got much more efficient ones
.
Q13  Q14  Q15
MAN: Anything for the performers?
LYNNE: Yes, we’ve made a number of improvements backstage.
The small, dark dressing rooms we used to have have been converted into two large airy rooms
, so they’re much more comfortable now. And the state-of-the-art electronic sound and lighting systems have been installed.
Q16
MAN: OK, so what’s the first play that audiences can see when the theatre reopens?
LYNNE: We’ve got a very exciting production of Peter Shaffer’s Royal Hunt of the Sun, which is currently touring the country. That starts on October the 13th and runs till
the 19th
. We’re experimenting a bit with the time the curtain goes up. We used to start all our performances at 7.30, but that made it difficult for people to go home by public transport, so instead we’re beginning at
7
, because at 9.45, when it finishes, there are still buses running. Tickets are already selling fast. The Friday and Saturday performances sold out almost immediately and, in fact, now there are only tickets for
Monday
and
Thursday
.
Q17  Q18  Q19
MAN: How much are they?
LYNNE: We’ve introduced a simpler price structure. Ticket prices used to range from ￡6 to ￡30 but now they’re all
￡18
. They’re available from the box office, in person, by phone, fax or post, or online.
Q20
MAN: OK, Lynne, now if you’d like to give the contact details for the theatre…

剑桥雅思12
test7 Section2
雅思听力
原文
In this session in your training day we’re going to look at some of the more specialised holidays we offer at BC Travel.
Now, the travel business is very
competitive
and it’s important to be aware of how the market’s changing and developing.
In terms of age groups, the over-65s are an important market,
and one that’s increasing steadily year on year (Q11)
.
The fewest holidays are taken by the 31 to 42-year-olds, and that figure shows no sign of rising.
The biggest market at present is still the youngest group, the 16 to 30s, but this group’s also seen the biggest drop over the last few years,
whereas
there’s a noticeable growth in the number of holidays taken by the 55 to 64-year-olds (Q12)
.
As far as the 43 to 54-year-olds are concerned, bookings there are steady, but I have to say we haven’t seen the increase we expected.
One trend we’re noticing with nearly all age groups is the growing popularity of holidays in which clients do some kind of specialised activity.
I’m not talking here about adventure holidays, where clients take part in high-risk activities like white water rafting just for the thrill of it.
Activity holidays usually involve rather less high-risk sports, or things like art and music.
They’re not necessarily cheaper than ordinary holidays, often the opposite, in fact.
But they do often take place outside the main tourist centres,
which gives an opportunity for clients to find out more about the local people and customs (Q13)
, and many say this is one of the most positive features of these holidays.
Of course, they offer the chance to develop a new skill or talent,
but clients often say that more than this.
It’s the chance to create lasting relationships with other like-minded people that’s the main draw (Q14)
.
Let me give you some examples of BC Travel activity holidays.
Our painting holidays take place in four different centres in France and Italy and they’re very popular with clients of all abilities from beginners
onwards
.
We’ve got an excellent team of artists to lead the classes – some of them have been with us from the start.
And five additional ones will be joining us this year (Q15)
so that we can offer a greater number of classes in each centre.
As far as cooking holidays are concerned, I know a lot of agents offer holidays where clients cook recipes related to one
particular
country, usually the one they’re staying in.
But we focus on dishes from a great many different ones (Q16)
.
Apart from that you’ll find the usual emphasis on good quality, organic ingredients – that’s more or less a given nowadays – and there are generally some meat-free recipes included.
Our photography holidays take place in a wide range of countries from Iceland to Vietnam, and clients have the opportunity to see some stunning scenery.
Groups are small, no more than eight, so clients can have one-on-one tuition during the holiday (Q17)
, and excursions are arranged with fully-trained guides.
At the end of each holiday an exhibition is held of the photographs taken so that clients can see one another’s work and receive valuable feedback from the tutor.
Finally, let me tell you about our fitness holidays.
In Ireland and Italy we run one-week general fitness classes for all ages and levels of fitness.
Clients start the course with a consultation with a trainer, and together they draw up an individual programme.
As well as improving general fitness, clients find that they end up losing much of the
stress (Q18)
they’ve built up in their daily lives.
In Greece, we have a two-week holiday for clients who want to do something about their
weight (Q19)
.
This has all the features you’d expect, like a personalised diet programme, but one of its most popular features is that the exercise classes are all held on the beach.
People say it’s far preferable to being in a gym.
Finally, we offer several holidays in Morocco.
One very popular one is the mountain biking holiday.
Bikes are provided and there are different routes according to people’s ability.
We offer one which is tailored to the needs of
families (Q20)
, which is particularly popular.
OK, so that’s about all the time I have today, so thank you very much

剑桥雅思14 test2 section3
雅思听力
原文
TUTOR:
So, ROSIE and Martin, let’s look at what you’ve got for your presentation on woolly mammoths.
ROSIE:
OK, we’ve got a short outline here.
TUTOR:
Thanks. So it’s about a research project in North America?
MARTIN:
Yes. But we thought we needed something general about woolly mammoths in our introduction, to establish that they were related to our modern elephant, and they lived thousands of years ago in the last ice age.
ROSIE:
Maybe we could show a video clip of a cartoon about mammoths. But that’d be a bit childish. Or we could have a diagram,
it could be a timeline to show when they lived, with illustrations (Q21)
?
MARTIN:
Or we could just show a drawing of them walking in the ice? No, let’s go with your last suggestion.
TUTOR:
Good. Then you’re describing the discovery of the mammoth tooth on St Paul’s Island in Alaska, and why it was significant.
MARTIN:
Yes. The tooth was found by a man called Russell Graham. He picked it up from under a rock in a cave. He knew it was special – for a start it was in really good condition, as if it had been just extracted from the animal’s jawbone. Anyway, they found it was 6,500 years old.
TUTOR:
So why was that significant?
ROSE:
Well
the mammoth bones previously found on the North American mainland were much less recent than that (Q22)
. So this was really amazing.
MARTIN:
Then we’re making an animated diagram to show the geography of the area in prehistoric times. So originally, St Paul’s Island wasn’t an island, it was connected to the mainland, and mammoths and other animals like bears were able to roam around the whole area.
ROSE:
Then the climate warmed up and the sea level began to rise, and the island got cut off from the mainland.
So those mammoths on the island couldn’t escape; they had to stay on the island (Q23)
.
MARTIN:
And in fact the species survived there for thousands of years after they’d become extinct on the mainland.
TUTOR:
So why do you think they died out on the mainland?
ROSIE:
No one’s sure.
MARTIN:
Anyway, next we’ll explain how Graham and his team identified the date when the mammoths became extinct on the island.
They concluded that the extinction happened 5.600 years ago, which is a very precise time for a prehistoric extinction (Q24)
. It’s based on samples they took from mud at the bottom of a lake on the island. They analysed it to find out what had fallen in over time – bits of plants, volcanic ash and even DNA from the mammoths themselves. It’s standard procedure, but it took nearly two years to do.
TUTOR:
So why don’t you quickly go through the main sections of your presentation and discuss what action’s needed for each part?
MARTIN:
OK. So for the introduction, we’re using a visual, so once we’ve prepared that we’re done.
ROSIE:
I’m not sure.
I think we need to write down all the ideas we want to include here (Q25)
, not just rely on memory. How we begin the presentation is so important…
MARTIN:
You’re right.
ROSIE:
The discovery of the mammoth tooth is probably the most dramatic part, but we don’t have that much information, only what we got from the online article. I thought maybe
we could get in touch with the researcher who led the team and ask him to tell us a bit more (Q26)
.
MARTIN:
Great idea. What about the section with the initial questions asked by the researchers? We’ve got a lot on that but we need to make it interesting.
ROSIE:
We could
ask the audience to suggest some questions about it and then see how many of them we can answer (Q27)
. I don’t think it would take too long.
TUTOR:
Yes that would add a bit of variety.
MARTIN:
Then the section on further research carried out on the island – analysing the mud in the lake. I wonder if we’ve actually got too much information here, should we cut some?
ROSIE:
I don’t think so, but it’s all a bit muddled at present.
MARTIN:
Yes,
maybe it would be better if it followed a chronological pattern (Q28)
.
ROSIE:
I think so. The findings and possible explanations section is just about ready, but we need to practise it
so we’re sure it won’t overrun (Q29)
.
MARTIN:
I think it should be OK, but yes, let’s make sure.
TUTOR:
In the last section, relevance to the present day, you’ve got some good ideas but this is where you need to move away from the ideas of others and
give your own viewpoint (Q30)
.
MARTIN:
OK, we’ll think about that. Now shall we …

剑桥雅思12Test7Section4听力答案解析 The effects of environmental change on birds
剑桥雅思12 test7 section4
雅思听力
原文
OK, so we’ve been looking at how man-made changes in our environment can affect wildlife.
Now I’ll discuss a
particular
example.
Let’s take a look at mercury.
Mercury’s one of the 120 or so elements that make up all matter, and it has the symbol Hg.
It’s a shiny, silvery
substance
.
You may have seen it in old-fashioned thermometers, but it’s not used much for domestic purposes now because it’s highly
toxic
.
But the problem is that the amount of mercury in the environment’s increasing.
The main reason for this is the power plants used to produce electricity.
The main source of energy that most of them use is still coal, and when it’s burned it releases mercury into the atmosphere.
Some of this gets deposited into lakes and rivers, and if it’s ingested by a fish it’s not excreted, it stays in the fish’s body and it enters the food chain.
So it’s been known for some time that birds which eat fish may be affected, but what wasn’t known until quite recently is that those that eat
insects (Q31)
can also be affected.
So a woman called Claire Varian-Ramos is doing some research on how this is affecting birds.
And rather than looking at how many birds are actually killed by mercury poisoning, she’s looking for more subtle sub-effects.
And these may be to do with the
behavior (Q32)
of the birds，or with the effect of mercury on the way their brain works, so whether it leads to problem with memory for example.
And she’s particularly focusing on the effects of mercury on bird song.
Now，the process of song learning happens at a
particular
stage in the birds’ development, and what you may not know is that a young bird seems to acquire this skill by listening to the songs produced by its
father (Q33)
, rather than by any other bird.
And Varian-Ramos has already found in her research that if young male birds are
exposed
to mercury, if they eat food contaminated with mercury , then the songs they produce aren’t as
complex (Q34)
as those produced by other birds.
So quite low-level
exposure
to mercury is likely to have an impact on male birds in a natural situation, because it can mean that they’re less attractive to female birds, and so it can affect their chances of
reproduction (Q35)
.
Now the way she’s carrying out this research is worth thinking about.
She’s using a mixture of studies using birds kept in laboratories, and studies carried out outdoors in the wild.
The lab-based studies have the advantage that you don’t get all the variables you would in a natural setting.
so the
experimenter
has a much higher level of
control (Q36)
, and that means they can be more confident about their results in some ways.
And of course they don’t have to worry about going out and finding the birds in order to observe them.
So what are the implications here for humans?
Well, because many birds are
migratory
they may be transporting mercury far from contaminated sites.
For example, it’s been found that
ducks (Q37)
who’d been feeding at a contaminated site were later
shot
by hunters over a thousand kilometres away and
presumably
eaten.
But these birds likely had mercury levels high enough to warrant concern for human
consumption
.
In addition, going back to song learning by birds, we saw that this may be affected by mercury
contamination
.
Well, we also know that in humans, mercury causes developmental delays in the
acquisition
of
language (Q38)
, and in fact this process is very similar in the brain regions it involves and even the genes that are involved.
But mercury
contamination
has other important implications for humans as well.
It’s now known that an unborn child can be affected if the
food (Q39)
eaten by its mother contains high level of mercury , and these effects can be quite substantial.
In the end, it comes down to whether more value is placed on human economic wellbeing or environmental wellbeing.
It’s true there are new regulations for mercury emissions from power plants, but these will need billions of dollars to
implement
, and increase
costs (Q40)
for everyone.
Some argue that’s too much to pay to protect wildlife.
But as we’ve seen, the issues go beyond that, and I think it’s an issue we need to consider very carefully.

原文
LISA: Hi Tony, thanks ever so much for coming. You know we’ve been asked to organize something for John’s farewell?
TONY: Yeah, sure, it’s about time we started working out details.
LISA: Exactly. We don’t want to leave it so late that it’s double the work.
TONY: Mmm, mm, right, do you want me to take notes?
LISA: That’d be great, thanks.
TONY: Right, first thing is, when is the best time to hold it?
LISA: Well, he leaves on the twenty-fourth of December.
TONY: So what about the
twenty-second
?
Example
LISA: Yeah, I think that’s about right. We want it quite near the time, don’t we?
TONY: Sure, and what about a venue? In college? A hotel?
LISA: I think a hotel will probably work out rather expensive, and I’ve been looking at the
College Dining Room
; that seems pretty reasonable.
Q1
TONY: Fine, yeah, why not?
LISA: And then we ought to be thinking about invitations… Who mustn’t we forget to invite?
TONY: Well, obviously John and his wife.
LISA: Right.
TONY: And the Director.
LISA: Ah ha.
TONY: The
office staff
.
Q2
LISA: Yep, and all the teachers and all the
students
.
Q3
TONY: Anyone else?
LISA: Faculty Heads?
TONY: No, better draw the line, I don’t think it’s necessary.
LISA: Yeah, you’re right.
TONY: I don’t mind writing the invitations. When shall we get them out for?
LISA: Enough time but not too early. What about the fifteenth of
December
?
TONY: Well, there are exams on the sixteenth – better avoid them.
LISA:
Tenth
?
Q4
TONY: Yeah, that should do it.
LISA: So what does that leave? Oh yes, a present.
TONY: Would you mind doing that?
LISA: No, not at all; we usually go round with an envelope during
the coffee break
, don’t we?
Q5
TONY: Yeah, coffee break’s always the best time, ‘cos people have got their money handy.
LISA: Yeah, exactly. Do we suggest an amount? Or does it seem a bit unfair?
TONY: No, I think people welcome it. We suggested
six
dollars last time, is that OK?
Q6
LISA: Yeah, plenty I would have thought, which should leave us with about ninety dollars.
TONY: Have you any ideas for presents?
LISA: Well, I’ve been having a little think. I thought, you know, he loves music.
TONY: Yeah, and books.
LISA: So, I thought I’d check on prices for, well, perhaps CD players.
TONY: Yeah, that’s a, that’s a good idea, and also I thought maybe, you know, a
set of dictionaries
. I heard him say he needed a good one.
Q7
LISA: The other thing he was saying last week was that his computer printer had broken.
TONY: Umm. No, I’d be really frightened about getting the wrong type.
LISA: OK, yeah.
TONY: The other thing is something for the home – Jill suggested a coffee maker.
LISA: Oh yeah. I’ll certainly find out what they cost. OK, have you got all that down?
TONY: Yes.
LISA: Now we need to think a little more about the money. I know we’ve got a set amount from the Social Fund.
TONY: Right, what does that cover?
LISA: It’s meant to cover the cost of the room.
TONY: Yeah.
LISA: And a certain amount for food.
TONY: And also drinks?
LISA: Oh yeah, certainly.
TONY: But will it be enough?
LISA: What we’ve done in the past is to ask guests to bring some snacks.
TONY: Right.
LISA: We don’t ask them to bring more drinks because we figure that’s.., that should come from the Social Fund.
TONY: OK. Anything else for the guests to bring?
LISA: Well,
some music
, because there’ll be a tape deck there in the room, and we can have some dancing later on.
Q8
TONY: Anything else?
LISA: Well, it’s just a thought, but a couple of years ago we had a really good party
where we set up2 you know, some simple games.
TONY: Yeah, great. Wasn’t it based on photos from the students and teachers?
LISA: That’s right.
TONY: So we should ask the guests to bring
photos
. OK. I’ll put it on the invitations.
Q9
LISA: Now the last thing is, who shall we ask to do the
speech
?
Q10
TONY: Don’t you think it might be nice to have one of the students?
LISA: Well then, the Student Leader?
TONY: Yeah, much better than the Director giving speeches again.
LISA: OK then, I’ll ask her. Lovely! So, is that all?
TONY: Looks like it.
LISA: Great. Thanks ever so much… (fade out)

剑7 test 2 Section 3
雅思听力
原文
INTERVIEWER: We’re pleased to welcome Dr Martin Merrywhether of the Antarctic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand who has come along to talk to us today about the role of the Centre and the Antarctic Treaty.
INTERVIEWER: Now my first question is about the choice of location for the centre. Why Christchurch? Was it because of the climate?
DOCTOR: Well actually New Zealand
is the second closest country to Antarctica
and Christchurch is often used on Antarctic expeditions.
Q21
INTERVIEWER:
Right, so it’s because of where we are
… coupled with our historical role. So tell us – what is the main purpose of the centre?
DOCTOR: Well… we have two complementary roles. One is as a scientific base for expeditions and research and the other is as an information centre.
INTERVIEWER: Tell us something about the role as a scientific base.
DOCTOR: We’re able to provide information
about what scientists should take
with them to the South Pole – for example, the centre contains a clothing warehouse where expeditions are supplied with suitable clothing for the extreme conditions.
Q22
INTERVIEWER: I suppose you need a bit more than your normal winter coat!
DOCTOR: Yes, exactly and then there’s also the specialist library and mapping services.
INTERVIEWER: Right. And which countries are actually located at the centre?
DOCTOR: Well… the centre houses research programmes for New Zealand, for The United States as well as for Italy… there’s even a US post office at the American airforce base here.
INTERVIEWER: Really? And what does the visitor’s centre offer?
DOCTOR: Well, since very few people will ever experience the Antarctic first hand,
the visitors’ centre aims to recreate the atmosphere of Antarctica
. There’s a mock camp site where you can see inside an Antarctic tent and imagine yourself sleeping there. And the centre also acts as a showcase for the unique international co-operation which exists in Antarctica today.
Q23
INTERVIEWER: What is it actually like at the South Pole? I know you’ve been there on a number of occasions.
DOCTOR: Yes, I have and each time
I’m struck by the awesome beauty
of the place. It’s magnificent but you can really only visit it in the summer months.
Q24
INTERVIEWER: October to March.
DOCTOR: Yes, because it’s completely dark for four months of the year (pause)… and in addition it has to be the coldest place on earth.
INTERVIEWER: Colder than the North Pole? Why’s that?
DOCTOR: Well, unlike the North Pole, which is actually a frozen sea,
Antarctica is a land mass shaped like a dome
, with the result that the winds blow down the slopes at speeds of up to 150 km an hour and that’s what makes it so cold. And one other interesting thing is that Antarctica is the driest continent on earth, surprisingly, and so you have to drink large amounts of water when you’re there.
Q25
INTERVIEWER: How old is Antarctica?
DOCTOR: We’re pretty sure it was part of a larger land mass but it broke away from the rest of the continent 170 million years ago.
INTERVIEWER: How can you be certain of this?
DOCTOR:
… because fossils and rocks have been discovered in Antarctica
which are the same as those found in places such as Africa and Australia.
Q26
INTERVIEWER: Amazing… To think that it was once attached to Africa…
INTERVIEWER: Now let’s just have a look at the Antarctic Treaty. How far back does the idea of an international treaty go?
DOCTOR: Well, as far back as the 19th century, when eleven nations organised an international event.
INTERVIEWER: When was that exactly?
DOCTOR: In 1870. And it was called the Polar Research Meeting. And then, not long after that, they organised something called the First International Polar Year.
INTERVIEWER: And that took place when exactly?
DOCTOR:
Over two years from 1882 to 1883
. But it wasn’t until the 1950s that the idea of an international treaty was proposed. And in
1959 the Treaty was actually signed
.
Q27 Q28
INTERVIEWER: What do you see as the main achievements of the treaty?
DOCTOR: Well, firstly it means that the continent
is reserved for peaceful use
.
Q29
INTERVIEWER: That’s Article 1, isn’t it?
DOCTOR: Yes…
INTERVIEWER: That’s important since the territory belongs to everyone.
DOCTOR: Yes but not as important as Article 5,
which prohibits any nuclear explosions or waste disposal
.
Q30
INTERVIEWER: Which is marvellous. Well, I’m afraid we’re going to have to stop there because I’m afraid we’ve run out of time. Thanks for coming along today and telling us all about the centre and its work.

剑桥雅思6 test 2 Section 2听力原文与答案 train information
这篇Section 2无论是从听力录音的推进，还是讨论的话题方面其实都更像是Section 1的内容。首先，按照雅思官方的说法，Section 2应该是独白，但这道题前半部分明显是对话。其次，Section 2的场景通常为组织机构、活动、以及景点的介绍，而非这篇的交通咨询。
易错点主要是第11题和第14题。11题采用了语序颠倒的出题方式，而且king street作为车站名超出了不少同学的认知，导致反应不过来。第14题则主要是单词，如果不知道refreshment有食物的意思就难很多。至于后面的多选虽然也有一定难度，但无论是干扰项的设置还是同义替换都是常见的套路，因此不能算作易错点。

原文
CUSTOMER:           Hello. Um my family and I are staying here in Trebirch for a week or two and we wanted to know about the train services. We’re hoping to do a few local trips.
RAILPERSON:         OK. Well, I can give you lots of details about all the trains going from Trebirch in the South West. This leaflet will be very helpful but I can tell you some of the main things. We’ve got two main train stations in the town.
King Street
is for local commuter lines and regional services.
Q11
CUSTOMER:           What about trains to London? I’ll need to go there on business for one day.
RAILPERSON:         Then you need to go to
Central
Station – that’s for all the national services. There are regular trains to London. They leave Trebirch
every half hour
on weekdays and every hour at weekends. It takes about two hours, a bit longer on Sundays. You’ve got a choice of first and second class and there’s a buffet car – though
refreshments
are included in the cost of a first class ticket.
Q12  Q13  Q14
CUSTOMER:           Ah right. Um, and have you got any information on different ticket types?
RAILPERSON:         Yes. There’s a range of ticket prices depending on when you travel and when you buy your ticket. There’s a standard open ticket which doesn’t have any restrictions. This can be bought in advance or on the day. You can also get various discounted tickets. A popular one is called the Supersave and, er, this is OK for travel after 8.45. Then there is the Special ticket, which is valid for travel after
10.15
. The Special tickets are also valid for travel at weekends. The cheapest tickets are called
Advance
and you have to buy them at least six days ahead. Only a certain number are available and you have to make seat
reservations
for these.
Q15  Q16  Q17
CUSTOMER:           Thanks. And are there lots of places to go to around here?
RAILPERSON:      Oh yes. You can enjoy many days out. Um there’s the Merthyr
Mining Museum
, which is only half an hour from Trebirch by train. Your children will find it just as fascinating as any theme park and they can ride in the original miners’ lifts and on the coal trains. There are special excursion tickets which include entrance fees. Mainline trains also offer direct services to Bristol, where you can visit the docks or spend a great day out with the children in the
zoo
, which is set in the parkland that used to surround the old castle. Er, special family awayday fares are available for this service now during the school holidays. Er, alternatively, you can be in Birmingham in only an hour and a half, where there’s lots to see and do including the new and internationally-acclaimed
climbing wall
built on the site of the old aquarium. We will also be running a special service to Newport when the new science museum opens next year, as we anticipate a lot of visitors in the opening weeks. I’d advise you to call early to book your tickets. Is that OK?
Q18  Q19  Q20
CUSTOMER:           Yes, thanks.

TEACHER:
Before we start, Spiros and Hiroko, thanks for coming in today to talk about your recent study experiences and congratulations to you both in doing so well in your first semester exams! I’d like to discuss with you the value of the English for Academic Purposes course you did here last year before starting your university course. Spiros, if I could start with you, what parts of the programme have now proved to be particularly valuable to you?
SPIROS:
I think that having to do a seminar presentation really helped me. For example, a couple of weeks ago in our marketing subject, when it was my turn to give a presentation I felt quite confident. Of course, I was still nervous but because I had done one before, I knew what to expect. Also, I know I was well-prepared and I had practised my timing. In fact, I think that in relation to some of the other people in my group, I did quite a good job because
my overall style was quite professional (Q21)
. What about you, Hiroko?
HIROKO:
Mmm, that’s interesting. In my group, I was really surprised by the way the students did their presentations – they just read their notes aloud! Can you believe that?
They didn’t worry about their presentation style or keeping eye contact with their audience (Q22)
– and I remember that these things were really stressed to us in the course here.
TEACHER:
So, how did you approach your presentation, Hiroko?
HIROKO:
Well, to speak frankly, I read my notes too! At the time, it was a relief to do it this way, but actually, when I had finished,
I didn’t feel any real sense of satisfaction (Q23)
. I didn’t feel positive about the experience at all.
SPIROS:
That’s a pity. You know, although I was pleased with my presentation,
I am not so pleased with my actual performance right now in the tutorials (Q24)
– during the whole semester I’ve not said anything in our tutorial discussions. Not a word.
HIROKO:
Really, Spiros? Why’s that? Do the other students talk too much?
SPIROS:
It’s partly that, but it’s mostly because I have had no confidence to speak out. Their style of speaking is so different – it’s not the style we were used to during the course. They use so many colloquialisms, they’re not very polite and sometimes there seems to be no order in their discussion. Also,
they are very familiar with each other, so because they know each other’s habits, they can let each other into the discussion (Q25)
.
HIROKO:
You’re right, Spiros, I’ve experienced that too.
HIROKO:
For most of this semester, I’ve said absolutely nothing in tutorials. But recently,
I’ve been trying to speak up more and I just jump in (Q26)
, and I’ve noticed an interesting thing, I’ve noticed that if they thought my point was interesting or new, then the next time they actually asked for my opinion, and then it was much easier for me to be part of the discussion.
SPIROS:
That’s great, Hiroko! I hope that happens for me next semester – I’ll have to work hard to find some interesting points. What helped you to find these ideas?
HIROKO:
I think that one thing that helped me with this was the reading. I’ve had to do so much reading this semester just to help me make sense of the lectures. At first, I couldn’t understand what the lecturers were talking about,
so I had to turn to the books and journals (Q27)
. Every night I read for hours, using the lists of references that were given, and I made pages of notes. At breakfast, I read and read my notes again. This habit has helped me to follow the ideas in the lectures, and it’s also given me some ideas to use in the tutorials.
SPIROS:
But I did so much reading anyway – I don’t think there’s any time left over for anything extra.
My reading speed is still quite slow (Q28)
, though I’m much better at dealing with vocabulary than I used to be.
TEACHER:
What else do you think we could add to the course program to help with this reading problem?
SPIROS:
There’s not really anything because it’s my problem. I remember we were given long articles to read. We didn’t like that but now I realise that reading those long articles was good preparation for the things I need to read now. Also, in class, we regularly had speed-reading tasks to do, and we kept a record of our reading speed, so the teachers were encouraging us to work on that.
HIROKO:
That’s true Spiros, but what we read could have been different. Sometimes in the English class, I felt frustrated when I had to read articles about the environment or health or education, because
I wanted to concentrate on my own field but we didn’t read anything about engineering (Q29)
. So, I think I wasted some time learning vocabulary I didn’t need.
TEACHER:
But surely the strategies you were taught for dealing with that vocabulary were helpful.
HIROKO:
Yes, but psychologically speaking,
I would have felt much better working on reading from my own field (Q30)
. What do you think Spiros?
SPIROS:
I agree; that would have helped my confidence too and I would have been more motivated. It was good though that we could work on our own topics when we wrote the research assignments.
TEACHER:
Okay, let’s move on to writing now …

剑9 test 2 Section 4
雅思听力
原文
Good morning everyone. Now whether you’re going to university to study business or some other subject, many of you will eventually end up working for a company of some kind.
Now, when you first start working somewhere you will realise that the organisation you’ve joined has certain characteristics. And we often refer to these social characteristics as the culture of the organisation – this includes its unwritten ideas, beliefs, values and things like that. One well-known writer has classified company cultures by identifying four major types.
The first type is called the Power Culture, and it’s usually found in small organisations.
It’s the type of culture that needs a
central
(Q31)
source of power to be effective, and because control is in the hands of just one or two people there aren’t many rules or procedures. Another characteristic is that communication usually takes the form of
conversations
(Q32)
rather than, say, formal meetings or written memos. Now one of the benefits of this culture is that the organisation has the ability to act quickly, so it responds well to threat, or danger on the one hand, and opportunity on the other.
But on the negative side, this type of organisation doesn’t always act
effectively (Q33)
, because it depends too much on one or two people at the top, and when these people make poor decisions there’s no-one else who can influence them.
And the kind of person who does well in this type of business culture is one who is happy to take
risks
(Q34)
, and for whom job security is a low priority.
The next type is known as Role Culture – that’s R-O-L-E, not R-O-double L, by the way, and this type is usually found in large companies, which have lots of different
levels (Q35)
in them. These organisations usually have separate departments that specialise in things like finance, or sales, or maintenance, or whatever. Each one is co-ordinated at the top by a small group of senior managers, and typically everyone’s job is controlled by sets of rules and procedures – for example, there are specific job
descriptions (Q36)
, rules for discipline, and so on.
What are the benefits of this kind of culture? Well firstly, because it’s found in large organisations, its fixed costs, or overheads as they’re known, are low in relation to its output, or what it produces. In other words it can achieve economies of scale. And secondly, it is particularly successful in business markets where
technical (Q37)
expertise is important. On the other hand, this culture is often very slow to recognise the need for
change (Q38)
, and even slower to react. What kind of person does this type of culture suit? Well it suits employees who value security, and who don’t particularly want to have
responsibility (Q39)
.
Moving on now to Task Cultures – this type is found in organisations that are project-oriented. You usually find it where the market for the company’s product is extremely competitive, or where the products themselves have a short life-span. Usually top management delegates the projects, the people and other resources. And once these have been allocated, little day-to-day control is exercised from the top, because this would seem like ‘breaking the rules’.
Now one of the major benefits of this culture is that it’s
flexible (Q40)
. But it does have some major disadvantages too. For instance, it can’t produce economies of scale or great depth of expertise. People who like working in groups or teams prefer this type of culture.
And finally, the fourth category is called the Person Culture …

原文
STEPHANIE:
Hello, Trevor.
TREVOR:
Hello, Stephanie. You said you wanted to talk about the course I’m taking on literature for children.
STEPHANIE:
That’s right. I’m thinking of doing it next year, but I’d like to find out more about it first.
TREVOR:
OK, well, as you probably know, it’s a one-year course. It’s divided into six modules, and you have to take all of them. One of the most interesting ones, for me, at least, was about the purpose of children’s literature.
STEPHANIE:
You mean, whether it should just entertain children or should be educational, as well.
TREVOR:
Right, and whether the teaching should be factual – giving them information about the world – or ethical, teaching them values. What’s fascinating is that
the writer isn’t necessarily conscious of the message they’re conveying (Q21)
. For instance, a story might show a child who has a problem as a result of not doing what an adult has told them to do, implying that children should always obey adults.
STEPHANIE:
I see what you mean.
TREVOR:
That module made me realise how important stories are – they can have a significant effect on children as they grow up. Actually,
it inspired me to have a go at it myself (Q22)
, just for my own interest. I know I can’t compete with the really popular stories, like the Harry Potter books – they’re very good, and even young kids like my seven-year-old niece love reading them.
STEPHANIE:
Mm. I’m very interested in illustrations in stories. Is that covered in the course?
TREVOR:
Yes, there’s a module on pictures, and how they’re sometimes central to the story.
STEPHANIE:
That’s good. I remember some frightening ones I saw as a child and I can still see them vividly in my mind, years later! Pictures can be so powerful, just as powerful as words. I’ve always enjoyed drawing, so
that’s the field I want to go into when I finish the course (Q23)
. I bet that module will be really helpful.
TREVOR:
I’m sure it will. We also studied comics in that module, but I’m not convinced of their value, not compared with books. One of the great things about words is that you use your imagination, but with a comic you don’t have to.
STEPHANIE:
But children are so used to visual input – on TV, video games, and so on. There are plenty of kids who wouldn’t even try to read a book, so I think
comics can serve a really useful purpose (Q24)
.
TREVOR:
You mean, it’s better to read a comic than not to read at all? Yes, I suppose you’re right. I just think it’s sad when children don’t read books.
STEPHANIE:
What about books for girls and books for boys? Does the course go into that?
TREVOR:
Yes, there’s a module on it. For years, lots of stories, in English, at least, assumed that boys went out and did adventurous things and girls stayed at home and played with dolls. I was amazed
how many books were targeted at just one sex or the other (Q25)
. Of course this reflects society as it is when the books are written.
STEPHANIE:
That’s true. So it sounds as though you think it’s a good course.
TREVOR:
Definitely.
TREVOR:
Have you been reading lots of children’s stories, to help you decide whether to take the course?
STEPHANIE:
Yeah. I’ve gone as far back as the late seventeenth century, though I know there were earlier children’s stories.
TREVOR:
So does that mean you’ve read Perrault’s fairy tales? Cinderella, The Sleeping Beauty, and so on.
STEPHANIE:
Yes. They must be important,
because no stories of that type had been written before, these were the first (Q26)
. Then there’s The Swiss Family Robinson.
TREVOR:
I haven’t read that.
STEPHANIE:
The English name makes it sound as though Robinson is the family’s surname, but a more accurate translation would be The Swiss Robinsons, because it’s about
a Swiss family who are shipwrecked, like Robinson Crusoe in the novel of a century earlier (Q27)
.
TREVOR:
Well I never knew that!
STEPHANIE:
Have you read Hoffmann’s The Nutcracker and the Mouse King?
TREVOR:
Wasn’t that
the basis for Tchaikovsky’s ballet The Nutcracker (Q28)
?
STEPHANIE:
That’s right. It has some quite bizarre elements.
TREVOR:
I hope you’ve read Oscar Wilde’s The Happy Prince. It’s probably my favourite children’s story of all time.
STEPHANIE:
Mine too! And it’s so surprising, because Wilde is best known for his plays, and most of them are very witty, but The Happy Prince is really moving.
I struggled with Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings – three long books, and I gave up after one (Q29)
.
TREVOR:
It’s extremely popular, though.
STEPHANIE:
Yeah, but whereas something like The Happy Prince just carried me along with it, The Lord of the Rings took more effort than I was prepared to give it.
TREVOR:
I didn’t find that – I love it.
STEPHANIE:
Another one I’ve read is War Horse.
TREVOR:
Oh yes. It’s about the First World War, isn’t it?
Hardly what you’d expect for a children’s story (Q30)
.
STEPHANIE:
Exactly, but it’s been very successful. Have you read any …

SUSIE:
Hello?
PAUL:
Hi, Susie, it’s Paul here.
How are you? Enjoying your new job?
You’re working at the library, aren’t you?
SUSIE:
Yes. I started when the library re-opened a month ago. It’s great.
PAUL:
Actually Carol and I have been meaning to join for a while.
SUSIE:
Oh, you should. It doesn’t cost anything, and the new library has all sorts of facilities.
It’s not just a place where you borrow books.
For
instance
, there’s an area with comfortable seats where you can sit and read the magazines they have there.
Some people spend the whole morning there.
PAUL:
Mmm. Wish I had that amount of time to spend!
SUSIE:
Yes, you must be pretty busy at present, with the children and everything?
PAUL:
We are, yes. But we’re hoping to get away this summer.
We’re thinking of going to Greece.
SUSIE:
Well, we’ve got a much larger section of the library devoted to
travel (Q1)
books now, so you should come and have a look.
I can’t remember if there’s anything specifically on Greece, but I should think so.
PAUL:
OK. Now Carol’s organising a project for the history class she teaches at school – it’s about life in the town a hundred years ago.
Do you have anything that might be useful?
SUSIE:
Yes, actually we’ve now got a new section with materials on the
history (Q2)
of the town and surrounding region.
PAUL:
Right. I’ll tell her.
You can’t always find that sort of thing on the internet.
Now in the old library there used to be a separate room with reference books.
It was a really nice quiet room.
SUSIE:
Yes. We’ve put those books in the main part of the library now, but we do have a room called the community room.
It can be hired out for meetings.
But at other times people can use it to
study (Q3)
.
PAUL:
I might use that.
It’s hard to find anywhere quiet at home sometimes.
SUSIE:
I can’t remember how old your son and daughter are.
We’ve introduced a special section of fiction written specially for
teenagers (Q4)
, but they might be a bit young for that?
PAUL:
Yes, they would be.
SUSIE:
Well, we do have lots of activities for younger children.
PAUL:
Yes?
SUSIE:
For example we have a Science Club.
At the next meeting, they’re going to be doing experiments with stuff that everyone has in the
kitchen (Q5)
– sugar and
flour
and so on.
PAUL:
They might be interested, yes.
SUSIE:
And we have a competition for children called Reading Challenge.
That doesn’t begin until after the end of term.
They have to read six books, and they get a certificate if they manage it.
PAUL:
So that gives them something to do while they’re on holiday, instead of getting bored.
SUSIE:
That’s the idea. And there’s special activities for adults too.
On Friday we have a local author called Tanya Streep who’s going to be talking about her new novel. .
It’s called “Catch the Mouse” and she based the story on a
crime (Q6)
that actually took place here years ago.
PAUL:
Right. We’re not free on Friday, but I’ll look out for the book.
SUSIE:
Now this probably isn’t for you, but we do have IT support available for members.
We get quite a few older people coming along who are wanting to get up to speed with computer technology.
It’s on Tuesday mornings – they don’t need to make an
appointment (Q7)
or anything, they just turn up.
PAUL:
Well, my mother might be interested, I’ll let her know.
SUSIE:
OK. And there’s another service which you wouldn’t expect from a library,
which is a free medical check-up.
The hospital arranges for someone to come along and measure the level of
sugar (Q8)
in your blood,
and they check
cholesterol
levels at the same time.
PAUL:
Really?
SUSIE:
Yes, but that’s only for the over-60s, so you wouldn’t qualify.
PAUL:
OK, Well, I’ll tell my mother, she might be interested.
SUSIE:
What other information…
Well, we do have a little shop with things like wall charts and greetings cards, and also
stamps (Q9)
,
so you can post the cards straightaway, which is really useful.
PAUL:
Yeah. Well, I’ll bring the children round at the weekend and we’ll join.
Oh, one more thing – I’ll be bringing the car, is there
parking (Q10)
available?
SUSIE:
Yes. and it’s free in the evening and at weekends.
PAUL:
Perfect. Well, thanks, Susie, see you soon.

剑桥雅思17 test2 Part2
雅思听力
原文
Good morning, and welcome to Oniton Hall, one of the largest estates in the area. My name’s Nick, and I’m one of the guides. I’ll give you a brief introduction to the estate while you’re sitting down, and then we’ll walk round.
The estate consists of the house, gardens, parkland and farm, and it dates back to the fourteenth century. The original house was replaced in the late seventeenth century, and of course it has had a large number of owners.
Almost all of them have left their mark, generally
by adding new rooms, like the ballroom and conservatory, or by demolishing others (Q11)
.
The farm looks much as it’s always done, although the current owner has done a great deal of work to the flower beds.
In the seventeenth century, the estate was owned by a very wealthy man called Sir Edward Downes. His intention was to escape from the world of politics, after years as an active politician, and to build a new house worthy of his big collection of books, paintings and sculptures. He broke off contact with his former political allies, and
hosted meetings of creative and literary people, like painters and poets (Q12)
. Unusually for his time, he didn’t care whether his guests were rich or poor, as long as they had talent.
Big houses like Oniton had dozens of servants until the 1920s or 30s, and we’ve tried to show what their working lives were like. Photographs of course don’t give much of an idea, so instead, as you go round the house, you’ll see
volunteers dressed up as nineteenth-century servants (Q13)
, going about their work. They’ll explain what they’re doing, and tell you their recipes, or what tools they’re using. We’ve just introduced this feature to replace the audio guide we used to have available.
I see there are a number of children here with you today. Well, we have several activities specially for children, like dressing up in the sorts of clothes that children wore in the past, and as it’s a fine day, some of you will probably want to play in the adventure playground.
Our latest addition is child-sized tractors (Q14)
, that you can drive around the grounds.
We’ll also be going into the farm that’s part of the estate, where there’s plenty to do. Most of the buildings date from the eighteenth century, so you can really step back into an agricultural past.
Until recently, the dairy was where milk from the cows was turned into cheese.
It’s now the place to go for lunch, or afternoon tea, or just a cup of coffee and a slice of homemade cake (Q15)
.
The big stone building that dominates the farm is the large barn, and
in here is our collection of agricultural tools (Q16)
. These were used in the past to plough the earth, sow seeds, make gates, and much more.
There’s a small barn, also made of stone,
where you can groom the donkeys and horses, to keep their coats clean (Q17)
. They really seem to enjoy having it done, and children love grooming them.
The horses no longer live in the stables, which instead is
the place to go to buy gifts, books, our own jams and pickles, and clothes and blankets (Q18)
made of wool from our sheep.
Outside the shed, which is the only brick building,
you can climb into a horse-drawn carriage for a lovely, relaxing tour (Q19)
of the park and farm. The carriages are well over a hundred years old.
And finally, the parkland, which was laid out in the eighteenth century, with a lake and trees that are now well established.
You’ll see types of cattle and sheep that are hardly ever found
on farms these days (Q20)
. We’re helping to preserve them, to stop their numbers falling further.
OK, well if you’d like to come with me …

剑桥雅思5 test 3 Section 1听力原文与答案 Mintons Car Mart
这篇雅思听力讲述了顾客买车咨询的过程。这一场景虽然不像求职、租房那么热门，但时不时也会出现一次，大家还是需要注意一下，尤其是那些跟汽车有关的词汇。此外还需要说明的是第1题的答案。很多同学可能都没有带后面litres的单位，导致出错。但是现在雅思考试题目一般都会自带单位，所以不用太过担心。
易错点主要是第2题，第5题和第6题。第2题是单纯的拼写，本身不难；第5题主要是double和r的连读，导致很多同学反应不过来，积累下读音就好；第6题则是离第5题太近，很容易漏掉。

原文
MAN: Good morning, please take a seat. How can I help you?
WOMAN: Well, I’m thinking of buying a new car and I’d like some advice.
MAN: Sure, yes. Had you got any particular make in mind?
WOMAN: I’m interested in a
Lida
– I’ve had one before and liked it. But I haven’t really made up my mind.
Example
MAN: Sure. We’ve got various models. Umm, right. What about the engine size? Any ideas?
WOMAN: The one I’ve got at the moment’s a 1.2 litre engine but I find it a bit slow on long journeys. I’d like a bit more power this time … a
1.4
should do, I don’t think I need a 1.6 or anything.
Q1
MAN: Right. Well I think the model you’re looking at is the Max. Here’s a picture.
WOMAN: Oh, yes … have you got one in?
MAN: Yes. I’ll take you to have a look at it in a minute. I’ll just get a few more details. Er … Is there anything else to do with the engine? What kind of gear change do you want? I presume you’d want a manual?
WOMAN: I’d want
automatic
– I’ve never driven a car with manual gears.
Q2
MAN: Right. Well now, here’s the colour chart for the Max. Have you given that any thought? This blue’s very popular at the moment.
WOMAN: Yes, it is nice, I like blue. What’s it called? ‘Royal’?
MAN: Yes.
WOMAN: But actually, I think I prefer this lighter shade here – ‘
Sky
’.
Q3
MAN: Yes, that’s popular too.
WOMAN: I think I’ll go for that.
MAN: You might have to wait a week or so for that colour, but I assume that’d be OK?
WOMAN: Oh yes, fine.
MAN: Well, we can go outside and you can have a good look at one, and perhaps take it out. But first, can I just ask you about finance? The cash price is going to be somewhere in the region of seven and a half thousand. How would you like to pay? Are you in a position to pay cash, or would you need credit?
WOMAN: I’d like
credit
provided the terms are reasonable.
Q4
MAN: Well you can discuss that with my colleague in a moment; we have various arrangements. And would you be interested in us taking your present car as part exchange?
WOMAN: Yes.
MAN: OK, fine. So I’ll just need some details from you and then we can do a valuation… Is that OK?
WOMAN: Fine, yes.
MAN: Could I have your full name?
WOMAN: Wendy Harries, that’s
H-A-double R-I-E-S
.
Q5
MAN: And is that Mrs … Miss … Ms …?
WOMAN: It’s
Doctor
, actually.
Q6
MAN: Oh, right. And your address?
WOMAN: 20 Green Banks.
MAN: Is that ‘Green’ spelled as in the colour?
WOMAN: Yes, that’s right.
MAN: OK.
WOMAN: Alton.
MAN: Is that
O-L-T-O-N
?
WOMAN: Not quite, it begins with an
A
, not an O.
Q7
MAN: Oh yes, that’s in Hampshire isn’t it?
WOMAN: That’s right.
MAN: And do you know your postcode?
WOMAN: Yes. It’s GU8 9EW.
MAN: Do you have a daytime phone number?
WOMAN: Well, I work at the hospital but it’s a bit difficult to get hold of me. I can give you a number just for
messages
, and then I’ll get back to you when I can. Is that OK?
Q8
MAN: That’s fine.
WOMAN: It’s 0-7-9-8-2-5-7-6-4-3.
MAN: Fine. And about the car you have now, what make is it?
WOMAN: It’s a Conti.
MAN: Do you know the year or the model name?
WOMAN: I think it’s 1996, and it’s called a
Lion
– like the animal.
Q9
MAN: Then it must be 1994, because they brought out the Fox after that.
WOMAN: Oh right, yes.
MAN: Mileage? Roughly?
WOMAN: I’m not sure. I know it’s less than seventy thousand.
MAN: OK. What colour is it?
WOMAN: It’s grey, metallic grey.
MAN: Right, and one last thing – what sort of condition would you say it’s in?
WOMAN: I’d probably describe it as
reasonable
. Do you need to see it? It’s parked outside.
Q10
MAN: Not at the moment, no. Perhaps you could call in one day next week…

ROSA: Oh, there you are, good. Sorry, I’m a bit late – there was a long queue. So, have you worked out how to deal with this assignment then?
MICK: Not yet, we’ve only been here a couple of minutes ourselves.
ROSA: Can you just remind me what the task is exactly?
PETE: Well, there are two, no, three, parts to it: first, we’ve got to write an essay about ways of collecting data. Then…
ROSA: What’s the title of the essay exactly?
MICK: I’ve got it here: Assess the two main methods of
collecting data
in social science research’.
Q21
ROSA: And how much do we need to write?
MICK:
Fifteen hundred words
. That’s for the essay. Then, for the second part of the assignment, we have to choose one method of data collection, and ‘carry out a small-scale study, making appropriate use of the method chosen to gather data from at least
five subjects
’.
Q22 Q23
ROSA: And then we have to write a report on the study?
PETE: That’s right, of
three to four thousand words
.
Q24
ROSA: Did you get as far as discussing which form of data collection we should go for -questionnaire or interview, isn’t it?
MICK: Yeah, I think we should use a questionnaire. It’ll be so much less time-consuming than organizing interviews, I reckon. Once we’ve agreed on the wording of it, we only have to send it out and wait for the responses.
ROSA: Yes, I think it probably would be quicker. But what did that article he gave us last week say about the quality of data from questionnaires?
MICK: I’m pretty sure it recommended questionnaires as a source of ‘highly reliable data’. As long as you design the questionnaire properly in the first place, the data will be fine.
ROSA: No, I’m sure it talked about drawbacks as well, didn’t it? Something about the
response rate and the problems you get if it’s too low.
Q25
MCK: Yeah, but we only need data from five subjects anyway.
ROSA: I suppose SO. Another drawback I remember it mentioned was that questionnaire data
tends not to reveal anything unexpected
, because it is limited to the questions fixed in advance by the researcher.
Q26
MICK: Come on, Rosa. This is only a practice. It’s not meant to be real research, is it?
ROSA: Well, I’m not sure about that.
ROSA: Maybe I’d better go through the article again, just to be sure. Can you remember what it was called?
MICK: ‘Sample Surveys in Social Science Research’, I think. By
Mehta
.
Q27
ROSA: M-E-H-T-A ?
MICK: Yeah. And he also recommended a more recent book, called ‘
Survey Research
’, by Bell, I think. It’s in that series published by
London University
.
Q28 Q29
PETE: And if we tried to use interviews instead, I saw a book in the departmental library that’ll be helpful: it’s called ‘Interviews That Work’, by Wilson, published in Oxford in
nineteen eighty-eight
.
Q30
ROSA: Right. I’ve got a tutorial now. Can we meet up again later this week? What about Friday morning?
PETE: Suits me. Eleven o’clock?
ROSA: Fine.
MICK: Before Friday, I think we should all look through the reading list.

原文
Thanks for coming everyone. OK, so this meeting is for new staff and staff who haven’t been involved with our volunteering projects yet. So basically, the idea is that we allow staff to give up some of their work time to help on various charity projects to benefit the local community. We’ve been doing this for the last five years and it’s been very successful.
Participating doesn’t necessarily involve a huge time commitment.
The company will pay for eight hours of your time (Q11)
. That can be used over one or two days all at once, or spread over several months throughout the year. There are some staff who enjoy volunteering so much they also give up their own free time for a couple of hours every week. It’s completely up to you. Obviously, many people will have family commitments and aren’t as available as other members of staff.
Feedback from staff has been overwhelmingly positive. Because they felt they were doing something really useful,
nearly everyone agreed that volunteering made them feel more motivated at work (Q12)
. They also liked building relationships with the people in the local community and felt valued by them. One or two people also said it was a good thing to have on their CVs.
One particularly successful project last year was the Get Working Project. This was aimed at helping unemployed people in the area get back to work.
Our staff were able to help them improve their telephone skills, such as writing down messages and speaking with confidence to potential customers, which they had found quite difficult (Q13)
. This is something many employers look for in job applicants – and something we all do without even thinking about, every day at work.
We’ve got an exciting new project starting this year. Up until now, we’ve mainly focused on projects to do with education and training. And we’ll continue with our reading project in schools and our work with local charities.
But we’ve also agreed to help out on a conservation project in Redfern Park (Q14)
. So if any of you fancy being outside and getting your hands dirty, this is the project for you.
I also want to mention the annual Digital Inclusion Day, which is coming up next month. The aim of this is to help older people keep up with technology.
And this year, instead of hosting the event in our own training facility, we’re using the ICT suite at Hill College (Q15)
, as it can hold far more people.
We’ve invited over 60 people from the Silver Age Community Centre to take part, so we’ll need a lot of volunteers to help with this event.
If you’re interested in taking part, please go to the volunteering section of our website and complete the relevant form (Q16)
. We won’t be providing any training for this but you’ll be paired with an experienced volunteer if you’ve never done it before. By the way, don’t forget to tell your manager about any volunteering activities you decide to do.
The participants on the Digital Inclusion Day really benefited. The majority were in their seventies, though some were younger and a few were even in their nineties! Quite a few owned both a computer and a
mobile phone, but these tended to be outdated models (Q17)
. They generally knew how to do simple things, like send texts, but weren’t aware of recent developments in mobile phone technology.
A few were keen to learn but most were quite dismissive at first – they couldn’t see the point of updating their skills (Q18)
. But that soon changed.
The feedback was very positive. The really encouraging thing was that p
articipants all said they felt much more confident about using social media to keep in touch with their grandchildren (Q19)
, who prefer this form of communication to phoning or sending emails.
A lot of them also said playing online games would help them make new friends and keep their brains active (Q20)
. They weren’t that impressed with being able to order their groceries online, as they liked going out to the shops, but some said it would come in handy if they were ill or the weather was really bad. One thing they asked about was using tablets for things like reading newspapers – some people had been given tablets as presents but had never used them, so that’s something we’ll make sure we include this time …

JACINTA:
Hello, Easy Life Cleaning Services, Jacinta speaking.
CLIENT:
Oh hello. I’m looking for a cleaning service for my apartment – do you do domestic cleaning?
JACINTA:
Sure.
CLIENT:
Well, it’s just a one-bedroom flat. Do you have a basic cleaning package?
JACINTA:
Yes. For a one-bedroom flat we’re probably looking at about two hours for a clean. So we’d do a thorough clean of all surfaces in each room,  and polish them where necessary. Does your apartment have carpets?
CLIENT:
No, I don’t have any, but the
floor (Q1)
would need cleaning.
JACINTA:
Of course – we’d do that in every room. And we’d do a thorough clean of the kitchen and bathroom.
CLIENT:
OK.
JACINTA:
Then we have some additional services which you can request if you want – so for example, we can clean your oven for you every week.
CLIENT:
Actually, I hardly ever use that, but can you do the
fridge(Q2)
?
JACINTA:
Sure. Would you like that done every week?
CLIENT:
Yes, definitely. And would ironing clothes be an additional service you can do?
JACINTA:
Yes, of course.
CLIENT:
It wouldn’t be much, just my
shirts (Q3)
for work that week.
JACINTA:
That’s fine. And we could also clean your microwave if you want.
CLIENT:
No, I wipe that out pretty regularly so there’s no need for that.
JACINTA:
We also offer additional services that you might want a bit less often, say every month. So for example, if the inside of your
windows (Q4)
need cleaning, we could do that.
CLIENT:
Yes, that’d be good. I’m on the fifteenth floor, so the outside gets done regularly by specialists, but the inside does get a bit grubby.
JACINTA:
And we could arrange for your curtains to get cleaned if necessary.
CLIENT:
No, they’re OK. But would you be able to do something about the
balcony (Q5)
? It’s quite small and I don’t use it much, but it could do with a wash every month or so.
JACINTA:
Yes, we can get the pressure washer onto that.
JACINTA:
Now if you’re interested, we do offer some other possibilities to do with general maintenance. For example, if you have a problem with water and you need a plumber in a hurry, we can put you in touch with a reliable one who can come out straightaway. And the same thing if you need an
electrician (Q6)
.
CLIENT:
Right. That’s good to know. I’ve only just moved here so I don’t have any of those sorts of contacts.
JACINTA:
And I don’t know if this is of interest to you, but we also offer a special vacuum cleaning system which can improve the indoor air quality of your home by capturing up to 99% of all the
dust (Q7)
in the air. So if you’re troubled by allergies, this can make a big difference.
CLIENT:
Right. In fact, I don’t have that sort of problem, but I’ll bear it in mind. Now can you tell me a bit about your cleaning staff?
JACINTA:
Of course. So all our cleaners are very carefully selected. When they apply to us, they have to undergo a security check with the
police (Q8)
to make sure they don’t have any sort of criminal background, and, of course, they have to provide references as well. Then if we think they might be suitable for the job, we give them
training (Q9)
for it. That lasts for two weeks so it’s very thorough, and at the end of it, they have a test. If they pass that, we take them on, but we monitor them very carefully – we ask all our clients to complete a
review (Q10)
of their performance after every visit and to email it to us. So we can pick up any problems straightaway and deal with them.
CLIENT:
OK, well that all sounds good. And will I always have the same cleaner?
JACINTA:
Yes, we do our best to organise it that way, and we usually manage it.
CLIENT:
Good. That’s fine. Right, so I’d like to go ahead and …

剑桥雅思18 Test2 Part4
雅思听力
原文
Good morning. Now, we’ve been asked to choose an aspect of European clothing or fashion and to talk about its development over time.
I decided to focus on a rather small area of clothing and that’s pockets. I chose pockets for two reasons, really. We all have them-in jeans, jackets, coats, for example – and even though we often carry bags or briefcases as well, nothing is quite as
convenient (Q31)
as being able to pop your phone or credit card into your pocket. Yet, I suspect that, other than that, people don’t really think about pockets too much and they’re rather overlooked as a fashion item.
It’s certainly very interesting to go back in time and see how pockets developed for men and women. In the 18th century, fashions were quite different from the way they are now, and pockets were too. If we think about male fashion first … that was the time when
suits (Q32)
became popular. Trousers were knee-length only and referred to as ‘breeches’, the waistcoats were short and the jackets were long, but all three garments were lined with material and pockets were sewn into this cloth by whichever
tailor (Q33)
the customer used. The wearer could then carry small objects such as pencils or coins on their person and reach them through a gap in the lining. Coat pockets became increasingly decorative on the outside for men who wanted to look stylish, but they were often larger but plainer if the wearer was someone with a
profession (Q34)
who needed to carry medical instruments – a doctor or physician, for example.
The development of women’s pockets was a little different. For one thing, they weren’t nearly as
visible (Q35)
or as easy to reach as men’s. In the 18th and 19th centuries, women carried numerous possessions on their person and some of these could be worth a lot of money. Women were more vulnerable to theft and wealthy women, in particular, worried constantly about pickpockets. So – what they did was to have a pair of pockets made that were tied together with
string (Q36)
. The pockets were made of fabric, which might be recycled cloth if the wearer had little money or something more expensive, such as linen, sometimes featuring very delicate embroidery. Women tied the pockets around their
waist (Q37)
so that they hung beneath their clothes. Remember, skirts were long then and there was plenty of room to hide a whole range of small possessions between the layers of petticoats that were commonly worn. They would have an opening in the folds of their skirts through which they could reach whatever they needed, like their
perfume (Q38)
. Working women, of course, also needed to carry around items that they might use for whatever job or trade they were involved in, but their pairs of pockets still remained on the inside of their clothing, they just got bigger or longer sometimes reaching down to their knees!
So the tie-on pockets went well into the 19th century and only changed when fashion altered towards the end of that period. That’s when dresses became tighter and less bulky, and the pairs of pockets became very noticeable – they stood out too much and detracted from the woman’s
image (Q39)
. Women who had been used to carrying around a range of personal possessions – and still wanted to-needed somewhere to carry these items about their person. That was when small bags, or pouches as they were known, came into fashion and, of course, they inevitably led on to the
handbag (Q40)
of more modern times, particularly when fashion removed pockets altogether.

剑桥雅思12
test5 Section3
雅思听力
原文
TRUDIE:
Ok, Stewart. We need to start planning our paper on public libraries.
Have you thought of an angle yet?
STEWART:
Well, there’s so much we could look into.
How libraries have changed over the centuries, for
instance
, or how different countries organize them.
What do you think, Trudie?
TRUDIE:
Maybe we should concentrate on this country, and try and relate the changes in libraries to external developments, like the fact that far more people can read than a century ago, and that the local population may speak lots of different languages (Q21)
.
STEWART:
We could include something about changes in the source of funding, too.
TRUDIE:
Yes, but remember we’re only supposed to write a short paper, so it’s probably best if don’t go into funding in any detail.
STEWART:
Right. Well, shall we just brainstorm a few ideas, to get started?
TRUDIE:
Ok. We obviously need to look at the impact of new technology, particularly the internet.
Now that lots of books have been digitalized, people can access them form their own computers at home.
STEWART:
And if everyone did that, libraries would be
obsolete
.
TRUDIE:
Yes.
STEWART:
But the digitalized books that are available online for free are mostly out of copyright, aren’t they?
And copyright in this country lasts for 70 years after the author dies.
So you won’t find the latest best-seller or up-to-date information (Q22)
.
TRUDIE:
That’s an important point.
Anyway, I find it hard to concentrate when I’m reading a long text on a screen.
I’d much rather read a physical book.
And it takes longer to read on a screen.
STEWART:
Oh, I prefer it.
I suppose it’s just a personal
preference
.
TRUDIE:
Mm. I expected that libraries will go on evolving in the next few years.
Some have already become centers where community activities take place, like local clubs meeting there.
I think that’ll become even more common.
STEWART:
I’d like to think so, and that they’ll still be serving their traditional function, but I’m not so sure.
There’re financial implications, after all.
What I’m afraid will happen is that books and magazines will all disappear, and there’ll just be rows and rows of computers (Q23)
.
They won’t look anything like the libraries we’re used to.
TRUDIE:
Well, we’ll see.
TRUDIE:
I’ve just had an idea.
Why don’t we make an
in-depth
study of our local public library as background to our paper?
STEWART:
Yes, that’d be interesting, and raise all sorts of issues.
Let’s make a list of possible things we could ask about, then work out some sort of structure.
For
instance
, um, we could interview some of the staff, and find out whether the library has its own
budget (Q24)
, or if that’s
controlled by the local council.
TRUDIE:
And what their policies are.
I know they don’t allow food, but I’d love to find out what types of noise they ban – there always seems to be a lot of talking, but never music.
I don’t know if that’s a policy or it just happens.
STEWART:
Ah, I’ve often wondered. .
Then there are things like how the library is affected by
employment (Q25)
laws.
I suppose there are rules about working hours, facilities for staff and so on.
TRUDIE:
Right. Then there are other issues relating to design of the building and how customers use it.
Like what measures does the library take to ensure their
safety (Q26)
?
They’d need floor coverings that aren’t
slippery
, and
emergency
exits, for
instance
.
Oh, and another thing-there’s the question of the kind of
insurance (Q27)
the library needs to have, in case anyone gets injured.
STEWART:
Yes, that’s something else to find out.
You know something I’ve often wondered?
TRUDIE:
What’s that?
STEWART:
Well, you know they’ve got an archive of local newspapers going back years?
Well, next to it they’ve got the
diary (Q28)
of a well-known politician from the late 19th century.
I wonder why it’s there.
Do you know what his connection was with this area?
TRUDIE:
No idea.
Let’s add it to our list of things to find out.
Oh, I’ve just thought – you know people might ask in the library about local organizations, like sports clubs?
Well, I wonder if they keep a
database (Q29)
, or whether they just look online.
STEWART:
Right. I quite fancy finding out what the differences are between a library that’s open to the public and one that’s part of a
museum
(Q30)
, for example – they must be very different.
TRUDIE:
Mmm. Then something else I’d like to know is…

剑8 test 1 Section 2
雅思听力
原文
Hello, and thank you for asking me to your teachers’ meeting to talk about the Dinosaur Museum and to tell you a bit about what you can do with your students there.
Well, let me give you some of the basic information first. In regard to opening hours, we’re open every day of the week from 9. 00 am to 8. 00 pm except on Mondays when we close at
1.30 pm (Q11)
. And, in fact the only day in the year when we’re closed is on the
25th of
December (Q12
)
. You can book a guided tour for your school group any time that we’re open.
If you bring a school group to the museum, when you arrive we ask you to remain with your group in the
car park (Q13)
. One or more of the tour guides will welcome you there and brief you about what the tour will be about. We do this there because our entrance is quite small and we really haven’t got much room for briefing groups in the exhibition area.
As far as the amount of time you’ll need goes, if you bring a school group you should plan on allowing a minimum of 90 minutes for the visit. This allows 15 minutes to get on and off the coach,
45 minutes (Q14)
for the guided tour and 30 minutes for after-tour activities.
If you’re going to have lunch at the museum you will, of course, have to allow more time. There are two cafés in the museum, with seating for 80 people. If you want to eat there you’ll need to reserve some seating, as they can get quite crowded at lunch time. Then outside the museum at the back there are
tables (Q15)
, and students can bring their own lunch and eat it there in the open air.
When the students come into the museum foyer we ask them to check in their backpacks with their books, lunch boxes, etc, at the cloakroom before they enter the museum proper. I’m afraid in the past we have had a few things gone missing after school visits so this is a strict rule. Also, some of the exhibits are fragile and we don’t want them to be accidentally knocked. But
we do provide school students with handouts with questions and quizzes on them
.
(
Q16
)
There’s so much that students can learn in the museum and it’s fun for them to have something to do. Of course,
they’ll need to bring something to write with for these
(
Q17
)
. We do allow students to take photographs
(
Q18
)
.
For students who are doing projects it’s useful to make some kind of visual record of what they see that they can add to their reports. And finally, they should not bring anything to eat into the museum, or drinks of any kind.
There are also a few things the students can do after the tour. In the theatrette on the ground floor there are
c
ontinuous screenings of short documentaries about dinosaurs which they can see (Q19)
at any time. We used to have an activity room with more interactive things like making models of dinosaurs and drawing and painting pictures, even hunting for dinosaur eggs, but unfortunately the room was damaged in a bad storm recently when water came in the roof, so that’s closed at the moment. But we do have an IT centre where students have access to CD ROMs
with a ranqe of dinosaur games (Q20)
. These games are a lot of fun, but they also teach the students about the lives of dinosaurs, how they found food, protected their habitat, survived threats, that kind of thing.
And. . . I think that’s all I have to tell you. Please feel free to ask any questions if you would like to know anything else. . .

OFFICIAL:
Hello, Tourist Information Centre, Mike speaking, how can I help you?
WOMAN:
Oh, hi. I wanted to find out about cookery classes. I believe there are some one-day classes for tourists?
OFFICIAL:
Well, they’re open to everyone, but tourists are always welcome. OK, let me give you some details of what’s available. There are several classes. One very popular one is at the Food Studio.
WOMAN:
OK.
OFFICIAL:
They focus on seasonal products, and as well as teaching you how to cook them, they also show you how to
choose (Q1)
them.
WOMAN:
Right, that sounds good. How big are the classes?
OFFICIAL:
I’m not sure exactly, but they’ll be quite small.
WOMAN:
And could I get a
private (Q2)
lesson there?
OFFICIAL:
I think so … let me check, yes, they do offer those. Though in fact most of the people who attend the classes find it’s a nice way of getting to know one another.
WOMAN:
I suppose it must be, yes.
OFFICIAL:
And this company has a special deal for clients where they offer a discount of
20 percent (Q3)
if you return for a further class.
WOMAN:
OK. But you said there were several classes?
OFFICIAL:
That’s right. Another one you might be interested in is Bond’s Cookery School. They’re quite new, they just opened six months ago, but I’ve heard good things about them. They concentrate on teaching you to prepare
healthy (Q4)
food, and they have quite a lot of specialist staff.
WOMAN:
So is that food for people on a diet and things like that? I don’t know if I’d be interested in that.
OFFICIAL:
Well, I don’t think they particularly focus on low calorie diets or weight loss. It’s more to do with recipes that look at specific needs, like including ingredients that will help build up your
bones (Q5)
and make them stronger, that sort of thing.
WOMAN:
I see. Well, I might be interested, I’m not sure. Do they have a website I could check?
OFFICIAL:
Yes, just key in the name of the school – it’ll come up. And if you want to know more about them, every Thursday evening they have a
lecture (Q6)
at the school. It’s free and you don’t need to book or anything, just turn up at 7.30. And that might give you an idea of whether you want to go to an actual class.
OFFICIAL:
OK, there’s one more place you might be interested in. That’s got a rather strange name, it’s called The
Arretsa (Q7)
Centre – that’s spelled A-R-R-E-T-S-A.
WOMAN:
OK.
OFFICIAL:
They’ve got a very good reputation. They do a bit of meat and fish cookery but they mostly specialise in
vegetarian (Q8)
dishes.
WOMAN:
Right. That’s certainly an area I’d like to learn more about. I’ve got lots of friends who don’t eat meat. In fact, I think I might have seen that school today. Is it just by the
market (Q9)
?
OFFICIAL:
That’s right. So they don’t have any problem getting their ingredients. They’re right next door. And they also offer a special two-hour course in how to use a
knife (Q10)
. They cover all the different skills – buying them, sharpening, chopping techniques. It gets booked up quickly though so you’d need to check it was available.
WOMAN:
Right, well thank you very much. I’ll go and …

MAN:           Good morning. Can I help you?
WOMAN:        Yes. I’ve just been accepted on a course at the university and I’d like to try and arrange accommodation in the
hall of residence
.
Example
MAN:           Yes, certainly. Please sit down. What I’ll do is fill in a form with you to find out a little more about your preferences and so forth.
WOMAN:        Thank you.
MAN:           So first of all, can I take your name?
WOMAN:        It’s Anu
Bhatt
.
(Q1)
MAN;           Could you spell your name, please?
WOMAN:         Yes. A-N-U … B-H-A double T.
MAN:           Thanks, and could I ask your date of birth?
WOMAN:
31st
March 1972. (Q2)
MAN:           Thank you. And where are you from?
WOMAN:        India.
MAN:           Oh right. And what will you be studying?
WOMAN:        I’m doing a course in
nursing (Q3)
.
MAN:           Right, thank you. And how long would you want to stay in hall, do you think?
WOMAN:        Well, it’ll take three years but I’d only like to stay in hall for
two (Q4)
. I’d like to think about living outside for the third year.
MAN:           Fine. And what did you have in mind for catering? Do you want to cook for yourself or have all your meals provided, that’s full board?
WOMAN:        Is there something in between?
MAN:           Yes. You can just have evening meal provided, which is half board.
WOMAN:        That’s what I’d prefer.
MAN:           Yes, a lot of students opt for that. Now, with that in mind, do you have any special diet, anything we should know about?
WOMAN:        Yes, I don’t take
red meat
(Q5)
.
MAN:           No red meat.
MAN:           Now, thinking about the room itself, we have a number of options. You can have a single study bedroom or you can have a shared one. These are both what we call simple rooms. The other alternative is to opt for a single bedsit which actually has more space and better facilities. There’s about £20 a week difference between them.
WOMAN:       Well, actually my grant is quite generous and I think the
bedsit
(Q6)
sounds the best option .
MAN:         Lovely. I’ll put you down for that and we’ll see what availability is like. Now can I ask some other personal details which we like to have on record?
WOMAN:      Yes, of course.
MAN:          I wonder if you could let us know what your interests are. This might help us get a closer match for placing you in a particular hall.
WOMAN:       Ummm. Well, I love the
theatre
(Q7)
.
MAN:         Right.
WOMAN:       And I enjoy sports, particularly badminton.
MAN:          That’s worth knowing. Now, what we finish with on the form is really a list from you of what your priorities are in choosing a hall and we’ll do our best to take these into account.
WOMAN:       Well, the first thing is I’d prefer a hall where there are other
mature students (Q8)
, if possible.
MAN:         Yes, we do have halls which tend to cater for slightly older students.
WOMAN:       Ummm and I’d prefer to be out of
town (Q9)
.
MAN:          That’s actually very good for you because we tend to have more vacancies in out-of-town halls.
WOMAN:       Lucky!
MAN:          Yes. Anything else?
WOMAN:       Well, I would like somewhere with a
shared
area
(Q10)
, a TV room for example, or something like that. It’s a good way to socialise.
MAN:          It certainly is.
WOMAN:       That’s it.
MAN:          Now, we just need a contact telephone number for you.
WOMAN:       Sure, I’ll just find it. It’s double 67549.
MAN:          Great, so we’ll be in contact with you as soon as possible …

TIM:
Good morning. You’re through to the tourist information office, Tim speaking. How can I help you?
JEAN:
Oh hello. Could you give me some information about next month’s festival, please? My family and I will be staying in the town that week.
TIM:
Of course. Well it starts with a concert on the afternoon of the 17th.
JEAN:
Oh I heard about that. The orchestra and singers come from the USA. don’t they?
TIM:
They’re from Canada. They’re very popular over there. They’re going to perform a number of well-known pieces that will appeal to children as well as adults That sounds good. My whole family are interested in music.
TIM:
The next day, the 18th, there’s a performance by a ballet company called
Eustatis (Q1)
JEAN:
Sorry?
TIM:
The name is spelt E-U-S-T-A-T–S. They appeared in last year’s festival, and went down very well. Again, their programme is designed for all ages.
JEAN:
Good. I expect we’ll go to that. I hope there’s going to be a play during the festival, a comedy, ideally
TIM:
You’re in luck! On the 19th and 20th a local amateur group are performing one written by a member of the group. It’s called Jemima. That’ll be on in the town hall. They’ve already performed it two or three times. I haven’t seen it myself, but the
review (Q2)
in the local paper was very good
JEAN:
And is it suitable for children?
TIM:
Yes, in fact it’s aimed more at children than at adults, so both performances are in the afternoon.
JEAN:
And what about
dance (Q3)
? Will there be any performances?
TIM:
Yes, also on the 20th, but in the evening. A professional company is putting on a show of modern pieces, with electronic music by young composers
JEAN:
Uh-huh.
TIM:
The show is about how people communicate, or fail to communicate, with each other, so it’s got the rather strange name,
Chat (Q4)
.
JEAN:
I suppose that’s because that’s something we do both face to face and online.
TIM:
That’s right.
TIM:
Now there are also some workshops and other activities. They’ll all take place at least once every day, so everyone who wants to take part will have a chance.
JEAN:
Good. We’re particularly interested in cookery – you don’t happen to have a cookery workshop, do you?
TIM:
We certainly do. It’s going to focus on how to make food part of a
healthy (Q5)
lifestyle, and it’ll show that even sweet things like cakes can contain much less sugar than they usually do.
JEAN:
That might be worth going to. We’re trying to encourage our children to cook
TIM:
Another workshop is just for children, and that’s on creating
posters (Q6)
to reflect the history of the town. The aim is to make children aware of how both the town and people’s lives have changed over the centuries. The results will be exhibited in the community centre. Then the other workshop is in toy-making, and that’s for adults only.
JEAN:
Oh, why’s that?
TIM:
Because it involves carpentry – participants will be making toys out of
wood (Q7)
, so there’ll be a lot of sharp chisels and other tools around.
JEAN:
It makes sense to keep children away from it.
TIM:
Exactly. Now let me tell you about some of the outdoor activities. There’ll be supervised wild swimming …
JEAN:
Wild swimming? What’s that?
TIM:
It just means swimming in natural waters, rather than a swimming pool.
JEAN:
Oh OK. In a
lake (Q8)
, for instance.
TIM:
Yes, there’s a beautiful one just outside the town, and that’ll be the venue for the swimming. There’ll be lifeguards on duty, so it’s suitable for all ages. And finally, there’ll be a walk in some nearby woods every day. The leader is an expert on
insects (Q9)
. He’ll show some that live in the woods, and how important they are for the environment. So there are going to be all sorts of different things to do during the festival.
JEAN:
There certainly are.
TIM:
If you’d like to read about how the preparations for the festival are going, the festival organiser is keeping a
blog (10
). Just search online for the festival website, and you’ll find it.
JEAN:
Well, thank you very much for all the information.
TIM:
You’re welcome. Goodbye.
JEAN:
Goodbye.

剑桥雅思18Test1Part4听力答案解析 Elephant translocation
剑桥雅思18 Test1 Part4
雅思听力
原文
For my presentation today I want to tell you about how groups of elephants have been moved and settled in new reserves. This is known as translocation and has been carried out in Malawi in Africa in recent years. The reason this is being done is because of overpopulation of elephants in some areas.
Overpopulation is a good problem to have and not one we tend to hear about very often. In Malawi’s Majete National Park the elephant population had been wiped out by poachers, who killed the elephants for their ivory. But in 2003, the park was restocked and effective law enforcement was introduced. Since then, not a single elephant has been poached. In this safe environment, the elephant population boomed. Breeding went so well that there were more elephants than the park could support.
This led to a number of problems. Firstly, there was more competition for food, which meant that some elephants were suffering from hunger. As there was a limit to the amount of food in the national park, some elephants began looking further afield. Elephants were routinely knocking down
fences (Q31)
around the park, which then had to be repaired at a significant cost.
To solve this problem, the decision was made to move dozens of elephants from MajeteNational Park to Nkhotakota Wildlife Park, where there were no elephants. But, obviously, attempting to move significant numbers of elephants to a new home 300 kilometres away is quite a challenge.
So how did this translocation process work in practice?
Elephants were moved in groups of between eight and twenty. all belonging to one
family (Q32)
. Because relationships are very important to elephants, they all had to be moved at the same time. A team of vets and park rangers flew over the park in
helicopters (Q33)
and targeted a group, which were rounded up and directed to a designated open plain.
The vets then used darts to immobilise the elephants – this was a tricky manoeuvre, as they not only had to select the right dose of tranquiliser for different-sized elephants but they had to dart the elephants as they were running around. This also had to be done as quickly as possible so as to minimise the
stress (Q34)
caused. As soon as the elephants began to flop onto the ground, the team moved in to take care of them.
To avoid the risk of suffocation, the team had to make sure none of the elephants were lying on their chests because their lungs could be crushed in this position. So all the elephants had to be placed on their
sides (Q35)
. One person stayed with each elephant while they waited for the vets to do checks. It was very important to keep an eye on their
breathing (Q36)
– if there were fewer than six breaths per minute, the elephant would need urgent medical attention. Collars were fitted to the matriarch in each group so their movements could be tracked in their new home. Measurements were taken of each elephant’s tusks – elephants with large tusks would be at greater risk from poachers -and also of their
feet (Q37)
. The elephants were then taken to a recovery area before being loaded onto trucks and transported to their new home.
The elephants translocated to Nkhotakota settled in very well and the project has generally been accepted to have been a huge success -and not just for the elephants.
Employment (Q38)
prospects have improved enormously, contributing to rising living standards for the whole community. Poaching is no longer an issue, as former poachers are able to find more reliable sources of income. In fact, many of them volunteered to give up their
weapons (Q39)
, as they were no longer of any use to them.
More than two dozen elephants have been born at Nkhotakota since relocation. With an area of more than 1,800 square kilometres, there’s plenty of space for the elephant population to continue to grow. Their presence is also helping to rebalance Nkhotakota’s damaged ecosystem and providing a sustainable conservation model, which could be replicated in other parks. All this has been a big draw for
tourism (Q40)
, which contributes five times more than the illegal wildlife trade to GDP, and this is mainly because of the elephants. There’s also been a dramatic rise in interest …

该部分由10道单项选择题构成，这种情况在现在考试中虽然也会出现，但概率并不算大。难度上来讲，它比真实考试要难一些，一方面是选项偏长，另一方面是干扰项藏的比较隐蔽。其易错点主要有三个：
第12题，unfamiliar在听力原文中读的太过明显，十分具有迷惑性，进而忽视了题目中问的是导致压力的原因是什么。
第15题，与第12题相似，C选项their family puts too much pressure on them与听力原文太过相似，很容易让人忽视后面的内容而直接选择。
第20题，本身难度不大，但与第19题十分接近，很容易听完19题之后稍不留声就漏过去。

剑桥雅思4 Test 2听力Section 2答案解析
剑4 test 2 Section 2雅思听力原文：
So the counseling services we offer deal with any problems arising from your studies, or in your life outside the university. Let’s take academic counseling. If you’re confused about subjects or how to combine them in your degree, then we can advise you and discuss the career you are aiming for, so that you can see it all in context.
We can also chase up your tutor if you’re not getting proper feedback on how you are getting on in your subject.
Q11
Besides help with academic problems, you may also need personal counseling: if you think you’re already under stress, well, just wait till classes begin next week.  You’ll have to start adjusting to teaching and learning methods that may be unfamiliar to you, as well as the
mounting pressure as the
deadline for that first assignment creeps up on you
.
And of course, you have to cope with all this without your usual social network – you know, the social contacts. family and friends,
you could normally rely on for help
. All of this causes anxiety. . Studying overseas can trigger a personal crisis – you may have left a lot of what you might call ‘unfinished business’ back in your own country, or you may have
interrupted personal relationships
or even sometimes have broken them off to come overseas, and so the student often feels lonely, unhappy, unmotivated and unable to concentrate on studying. Or there may be other things bothering you. Our resident chaplain can offer you spiritual guidance if that’s what you want, or we can put you in touch with community groups that can provide you with social contacts and friendship.
Q12 Q13 Q14
What about exam stress? It affects nearly everyone to some extent, but especially overseas students like yourselves. There may be a huge amount of family pressure on you to succeed, and
if you fail a subject or drop out of a course because it’s too difficult then your self-esteem can suffer.
But it’s not the end of the world if you don’t pass an exam – I had to resit First Year Anthropology, so I can certainly offer you a sympathetic ear! Anyway, exam failure can lead to worrying changes in the way you normally behave. You may also be off your food, or you may have dietary problems because
the local food is not to your liking
and upsets you, and this can affect your health and studies. Glenda Roberts is our dietician in the Health Service and we can put you on to her.
Q15 Q16
And we all have money problems, don’t we? But remember, full-time students can get a
l
ow-interest loan of up to six hundred dollars to buy books
and for similar study-related expenses. That’s right, and you can get double that amount if you can’t afford an item of equipment you need for your course – a musical instrument, for example. And it doesn’t stop there.
When you move into a flat, starting-up expense, including furniture for it
, can be covered by a loan through the Welfare Service – see Jill Freeman for details.
Q17 Q18
Can we help you? Well, last academic year, in spite of staff cuts,
we counseled two hundred and forty international students
for a total of twenty-six hundred hours counseling, and, finally we won all but just one of the twelve appeals that we launched on behalf of students.
Not too bad for an understaffed service
, don’t you think? That’s all from me. Thank you.

原文
PAUL: Hello, Kira, how are you?
KIRA: Fine thanks, Paul, how are you?
PAUL: Well, thanks. It’s good to see you. It must be twelve months since you did our course?
KIRA: That’s right. It’s nice to come back and say hello.
PAUL: What course did you enrol in?
KIRA: Actually, I went straight into third-year Pharmacy. They credited me with two years, which probably made it more difficult for me.
PAUL: On the other hand, you were lucky to be granted credits. Is that why you chose the course?
KIRA: Yes. And, as
I’d already finished a course in it in my country (Q21)
, I thought it would be easier if I studied something I already knew.
PAUL: I didn’t realise you went into third year. I thought you started in the first year. No wonder it was so hard! And what do you think is one of the big differences between studying at a university here and studying in your country?
KIRA: Well, I’ve found it very difficult to write assignments, because I wasn’t familiar with that aspect of the system here. The main problem is that the lecturers expect you to be critical. That made me feel really terrible. I thought “How can I possibly do it? How can I comment on someone else’s research when they probably spent five years doing it?” I think a lot of people who come from overseas countries have similar problems. But after a while, it became easier for me. People expect you to have problems with the process of reading and writing but, in fact,
it is more a question of altering your viewpoint towards academic study (Q22)
.
PAUL:  How was the content of the lectures? Was it easy for you?
KIRA: I didn’t really have many problems understanding lectures. The content was very similar to what I’d studied before.
PAUL: And what about the lecturers themselves? Are they essentially the same as lecturers in your country?
KIRA: Well actually, no. Here, they’re much easier to
approach (Q23)
. After every lecture you can go and ask them something you didn’t understand. Or you can make an appointment and talk to them about anything in the course.
PAUL: Maybe you found them different because you’re a more
mature (Q24)
student now, whereas when you were studying in your country you were younger and not so assertive.
KIRA: No, I don’t think that’s the difference. Most of the students here do it. In my faculty, they all seem to make appointments – usually to talk about something in the course that’s worrying them, but sometimes just about something that might really
interest (Q25)
them, something they might want to specialise in. The lecturers must set aside certain times every week when they’re available for students.
PAUL: That’s good to hear.
PAUL: And how was your timetable? Was it a very busy year?
KIRA: Very, very busy. They make you work very hard. Apart from lectures, we had practical sessions in a lot of subjects. We did these
in small groups (Q26)
. I had to go and work four hours every week in a community pharmacy. Actually, I enjoyed this very much – meeting new people all the time. Then in second semester, we had to get experience in hospital dispensaries, so
every second day (Q27)
we went to one of the big hospitals and worked there. And on top of all that we had our assignments, which took me a lot of time. Oh, I nearly forgot, between first and second semesters, we had to work full-time for
two weeks (Q28)
in a hospital.
PAUL: That does sound a very heavy year. So are you pleased now that you did it? Do you feel some sense of achievement?
KIRA: Yeah, I do feel
much more confident (Q29)
, which I suppose is the most important thing.
PAUL: And have you got any recommendations for people who are studying from overseas?
KIRA: Well, I suppose they need very good English. It would be much better if they spent more time learning English before they enter the university, because you can be in big trouble if you don’t understand what people are saying and you haven’t got time to translate.
PAUL: Anything else?
KIRA: Well, as I said before, the biggest problem for me was a lack of familiarity with the
education system (Q30)
here.
PAUL: It sounds as if it was a real challenge. Congratulations, Kira.
KIRA: Thanks, Paul.

雅思听力
原文
LISA
: OK, Greg, so I finally managed to read the article you mentioned – the one about the study on gender in physics.
GREG
: About the study of college students done by Akira Miyake and his team?
Yeah. I was interested that the researchers were actually a mix of psychologists and physicists.
That’s an unusual combination.
LISA
: Yeah. I got a little confused at first about which students the study was based on.
They weren’t actually majoring in physics –
they were majoring in what’s known as the STEM disciplines.
That’s science, technology, engineering and …
GREG
:
… and math (Q21)
.
Yes, but they were all doing physics courses as part of their studies.
LISA
: That’s correct.
So as I understood it, Miyake and co-started from the fact that women are underrepresented in introductory physics courses at college, and also that on average,  the women who do enrol on these courses perform more poorly than the men.
No one really knows why this is the case.
GREG
: Yeah.
But what the researchers wanted to find out was basically what they could do about the
relatively
low level of the women’s results (Q22)
.
But in order to find a solution they needed to find out more about the nature of the problem.
LISA
: Right – now let’s see if I can remember …
it was that in the physics class, the female students thought the male students all assumed that women weren’t any good at physics …
was that it?
And they thought that the men expected them to get poor results in their tests.
GREG
: That’s what the women thought, and that made them nervous, so they did get poor results.
But
actually they were wrong …
No one was making any assumptions about the female students at all (Q23)
.
LISA
: Anyway, what Miyake’s team did was quite simple – getting the students to do some writing before they went into the physics class.
What did they call it?
GREG
: Values-affirmation-
they had to write an essay focusing on things that were significant to them (Q24)
, not particularly to do with the subject they were studying, but more general things like music, or people who mattered to them.
LISA
: Right. So the idea of doing the writing is that this gets the students thinking in a positive way.
GREG
:
And putting these thoughts into words can relax them (Q25)
and help them overcome the psychological factors that lead to poor performance.
Yeah. But what the researchers in the study hadn’t expected was that
this one activity raised the women’s physics grades from the C to the B range (Q26)
.
LISA
: A huge change.
Pity it wasn’t to an A, but still!
No, but it does suggest that the women were seriously underperforming
beforehand
, in comparison with the men.
GREG
: Yes. Mind you, Miyake’s article left out a lot of details.
Like, did the students do the writing just once, or several times?
And had they been told why they were doing the writing?
That might have affected the results (Q27)
.
LISA
: You mean, if they know the researchers thought it might help them to improve, then they’d just try to fulfil that expectation?
GREG
: Exactly.
GREG
: So anyway, I thought for our project we could do a similar study, but investigate whether it really was the writing activity that had that result.
LISA
: OK. So we could ask them to do a writing task about something completely different …
something more factual?
Like a general knowledge topic.
GREG
: Maybe …
or we could have half the students doing a writing task and half doing something else, like an oral task.
LISA
:
Or even, half do the same writing task as in the original research and half do a factual writing task (Q28)
.
Then we’d see if it really is the topic that made the difference, or something else.
GREG
: That’s it. Good.
So at our meeting with the
supervisor
on Monday we can tell him we’ve decided on our project.
We should have our aims ready by then.
I suppose we need to read the original study – the article’s just a summary.
LISA
: And there was another article I read, by Smolinsky.
It was about her research on how women and men perform in mixed teams in class, compared with single-sex teams and on their own.
GREG
: Let me guess …
the women were better at teamwork.
LISA
: That’s what I expected, but
actually the men and the women got the same results whether they were working in teams or on their own (Q29)
.
But I guess it’s not that relevant to us.
GREG
: What worries me anyway is how we’re going to get everything done in the time.
LISA
: We’ll be OK now we know what we’re doing.
Though I’m not clear how we
assess
whether the students in our experiment actually make any progress or not …
GREG
: NO. We may need some advice on that.
The main thing’s to make sure we have the right size sample, not too big or too small.
LISA
: That shouldn’t be difficult.
Right, what do we need to do next?
We could have a look at the timetable for the science classes …
or perhaps we should just make an appointment to see one of the science professors.
That’d be better (Q30)
.
GREG
: Great.
And we could even get to observe one of the classes.
LISA
: What for?
GREG
: Well …
OK maybe let’s just go with your idea.
Right, well …

JEREMY:
Hello, Helen.
Sorry I’m late.
HELEN:
Hi, Jeremy, no problem.
Well we’d better work out where we are on our project, I suppose.
JEREMY:
Yeah.
I’ve looked at the drawings you’ve done for my story, ‘The Forest’, and I think they’re brilliant – they really create the atmosphere I had in mind when I was writing it.
HELEN:
I’m glad you like them.
JEREMY:
There are just a few suggestions I’d like to make.
HELEN:
Go ahead.
JEREMY:
NOW, I’m not sure about the drawing of the
cave (Q21)
– it’s got trees all around it, which is great, but the drawing’s a bit too
static
, isn’t it?
I think it needs some action.
HELEN:
Yes, there’s nothing happening.
Perhaps I should add the boy – Malcolm, isn’t it?
He would be walking up to it.
JEREMY:
Yes, let’s have Malcolm in the drawing.
And what about putting in a
tiger (Q22)
– the one that he makes friends with a bit later?
Maybe it could be sitting under a tree washing itself.
HELEN:
And the tiger stops in the middle of what it’s doing when it sees Malcolm walking past.
JEREMY:
That’s a good idea.
HELEN:
OK, I’ll have a go at that.
JEREMY:
Then there’s the drawing of the crowd of men and women
dancing (Q23)
.
They’re just outside the forest, and there’s a lot going on.
HELEN:
That’s right, you wanted them to be watching a
carnival
procession, but I thought it would be too crowded.
Do you think it works like this?
JEREMY:
Yes, I like what you’ve done.
The only thing is, could you add Malcolm to it, without changing what’s already there.
HELEN:
What about having him sitting on the tree
trunk
on the right of the picture?
JEREMY:
Yes, that would be fine.
HELEN:
And do you want him watching the other people?
JEREMY:
No, he’s been left out of all the fun, so I’d like him to be
crying (Q24)
– that’ll contrast nicely with the next picture, where he’s laughing at the clowns in the
carnival
.
HELEN:
Right, I’ll do that.
JEREMY:
And then the drawing of the people ice skating in the forest.
HELEN:
I wasn’t too happy with that one.
Because they’re supposed to be skating on
grass
(Q25)
, aren’t they?
JEREMY:
That’s right, and it’s frozen over.
At the moment it doesn’t look quite right.
HELEN:
Mm, I see what you mean.
I’ll have another go at that.
JEREMY:
And I like the wool hats they’re wearing.
Maybe you could give each of them a
scarf (Q26)
, as well.
HELEN:
Yeah, that’s easy enough.
They can be streaming out behind the people to suggest they’re skating really fast.
JEREMY:
Mm, great.
Well that’s all on the drawings.
HELEN:
Right.
So you’ve finished writing your story and I just need to finish illustrating it, and my story and your drawings are done.{03:41.39}
HELEN:
So the next thing is to decide what exactly we need to write about in the report that goes with the stories, and how we’re going to divide the work.
JEREMY:
Right, Helen.
HELEN:
What do you think about including a section on how we planned the project as a whole, Jeremy?
That’s probably quite important.
JEREMY:
Yeah.
Well, you’ve had most of the good ideas so far.
How do you feel about drafting something (Q27)
, then we can go through it together and discuss it?
HELEN:
OK, that seems reasonable.
And I could include something on how we came up with the ideas for our two stories, couldn’t I?
JEREMY:
Well
I’ve started writing something about that, so why don’t you do the same and we can include the two things (Q28)
.
HELEN:
Right.
So what about our
interpretation
of the stories?
Do we need to write about what we think they show, like the value of helping other people, all that sort of thing?
JEREMY:
That’s going to come up later, isn’t it?
I think everyone in the class is going to read each other’s stories and come up with their own interpretations, which we’re going to discuss.
HELEN:
Oh, I missed that.
So it isn’t going to be part of the report at all (Q29)
?
JEREMY:
No.
But we need to write about the illustrations, because they’re an essential element of children’s experience of reading the stories.
It’s probably easiest for you to write that section, as you know more about drawing than I do.
HELEN:
Maybe, but I find it quite hard to write about.
I’d be happier if you did it (Q30)
.
JEREMY:
OK.
So when do you think …

LOUISE:
Yes, I’m here for two months. I go back next week.
OFFICER:
So may I ask where you’re staying now?
LOUISE:
Well at present I’ve got a place at
Park (Q3)
Apartments, that’s on King Street. I was staying at the Riverside Apartments on the same street, but the apartment there was only available for six weeks so I had to find another one.
OFFICER:
OK. And the apartment number?
LOUISE:
Fifteen.
LOUISE:
Right.
OFFICER:
Now, I need to take some details of the theft. So you said you had some things stolen out of your bag?
LOUISE:
That’s right.
OFFICER:
And were you actually carrying the bag when the theft took place?
LOUISE:
Yes. I really can’t understand it. I had my backpack on. And I went into a supermarket to buy a few things and when I opened it up my wallet wasn’t there.
OFFICER:
And what did your wallet have in it?
LOUISE:
Well, fortunately I don’t keep my credit cards in that wallet – I keep them with my passport in an inside compartment in my backpack. But there was quite a bit of cash there … about £
250 (Q4)
sterling, I should think. I withdrew £300 from my account yesterday, but I did a bit of shopping, so I must have already spent about £50 of that.
OFFICER:
OK.
LOUISE:
At first I thought, oh I must have left the wallet back in the apartment, but then I realised my
phone (Q5)
had gone as well. It was only a week old, and that’s when I realised I’d been robbed. Anyway at least they didn’t take the keys to my rental car.
OFFICER:
Yes. So you say the theft occurred yesterday?
LOUISE:
Yes.
OFFICER:
So that was
September the tenth (Q6)
. And do you have any idea at all of where or when the things might possibly have been stolen?
LOUISE:
Well at first I couldn’t believe it because the bag had been on my back ever since I left the apartment after lunch. It’s just a small backpack, but I generally use it when I’m travelling because it seems safer than a handbag. Anyway, I met up with a friend, and we spent a couple of hours in the
museum (Q7)
. But I do remember that as we were leaving there, at about 4 o’clock, a group of young boys ran up to us, and they were really crowding round us, and they were asking us what
time (Q8)
it was, then all of a sudden they ran off.
OFFICER:
Can you remember anything about them?
LOUISE:
The one who did most of the talking was wearing a T-shirt with a picture of something … let’s see … a tiger.
OFFICER:
Right. Any idea of how old he might have been?
LOUISE:
Around twelve years old?
OFFICER:
And can you remember anything else about his appearance?
LOUISE:
Not much. He was quite thin …
OFFICER:
Colour of hair?
LOUISE:
I do remember that – he was
blond (Q9)
. All the others were dark-haired.
OFFICER:
And any details of the others?
LOUISE:
Not really. They came and went so quickly.
OFFICER:
Right. So what I’m going to do now is give you a crime reference number so you can contact your insurance company. So this is ten digits:
87954 82361 (Q10)
.
LOUISE:
Thank you. So should I…

剑桥雅思15 Test2 Part2
雅思听力
原文
WOMAN:
I’m very pleased to welcome this evening’s guest speaker, Mark Logan, who’s going to tell us about the recent transformation of Minster Park. Over to you, Mark.
MARK:
Thank you. I’m sure you’re all familiar with Minster Park. It’s been a feature of the city for well over a century and has been the responsibility of the city council for most of that time. What perhaps isn’t so well known is the origin of the park:
unlike many public parks that started in private ownership, as the garden of a large house, for instance, Minster was some waste land, which people living nearby started planting with flowers in 1892 (Q11)
. It was unclear who actually owned the land, and this wasn’t settled until 20 years later, when the council took possession of it.
You may have noticed the statue near one of the entrances. It’s of Diane Gosforth, who played a key role in the history of the park. Once the council had become the legal owner, it planned to sell the land for housing. Many local people wanted it to remain a place that everyone could go to, to enjoy the fresh air and natural environment – remember the park is in a densely populated residential area.
Diane Gosforth was one of those people, and she organised petitions and demonstrations (Q12)
, which eventually made the council change its mind about the future of the land.
Soon after this the First World War broke out, in 1914, and most of the park was dug up and
planted with vegetables (Q13)
, which were sold locally. At one stage the army considered taking it over for troop exercises and got as far as contacting the city council, then decided the park was too small to be of use. There were occasional public meetings during the war, in an area that had been retained as grass.
After the war, the park was turned back more or less to how it had been before 1914, and continued almost unchanged until recently. Plans for transforming it. were drawn up at various times, most recently in 2013, though they were revised in 2015, before any work had started.
The changes finally got going in 2016 (Q14)
, and were finished on schedule last year.
OK, let me tell you about some of the changes that have been made – and some things that have been retained. If you look at this map, you’ll see the familiar outline of the park, with the river forming the northern boundary, and a gate in each of the other three walls. The statue of Diane Gosforth has been moved: it used to be close to the south gate, but
it’s now immediately to the north of the lily pond, almost in the centre of the park (Q15)
, which makes it much more visible.
There’s a new area of wooden sculptures, which are
on the river bank, where the path from the east gate makes a sharp bend (Q16)
.
There are two areas that are particularly intended for children. The playground has been enlarged and improved, and that’s
between the river and the path that leads from the pond to the river (Q17)
.
Then there’s a new maze, a circular series of paths, separated by low hedges. That’s
near the west gate -you go north from there towards the river and then turn left to reach it (Q18)
.
There have been tennis courts in the park for many years, and they’ve been doubled, from four to eight. They’re still
in the south-west corner of the park, where there’s a right-angle bend in the path (Q19)
.
Something else I’d like to mention is the new fitness area. This is
right next to the lily pond on the same side as the west gate (Q20)
.
Now, as you’re all gardeners, I’m sure you’ll like to hear about the plants that have been chosen for the park.

剑6 test 2 Section 1
雅思听力
原文
MAN:                        Good morning, Synmouth Museum. Can I help you?
WOMAN:                 Oh yes. Good morning. I’m interested in the children’s workshops and I’d like a little more information, please.
MAN:                       Do you mean the Art and Craft workshops?
WOMAN:                 Yes. A friend of a friend mentioned them – the children do painting and make models and so forth.
MAN:                       Yes, of course. Um, where to begin? First of all, as you probably know, they run every
Saturday
.
Example
WOMAN:                 Fine. And what about ages?
MAN:                       Well, all ages from five upwards are welcome, though we do ask that children below
eight
years of age are accompanied by an adult.
Q1
WOMAN:                 Fine. That wouldn’t be a problem. What about cost?
MAN:                       Well, I think you’ll find them very reasonable. It’s ￡2.50 a child, with 80 pence off for two or more children from the same family.
WOMAN:                 Oh yes, very reasonable. And are they held in the main museum?
MAN:                       Not exactly. They’re nearby.
WOMAN:                 Could you give me the full address? I don’t know the area very well.
MAN:                       Yes, it’s Winter House.
WOMAN:                 Right.
MAN:                       And that’s in Tamer Street.
WOMAN:                 Could you spell that please?
MAN:                       Yes,
T-A-M-E-R Street
.
Q2
WOMAN:                 Lovely.
MAN:                       And I do need to tell you that there’s a security entrance, so you need to press the
green button
for someone to let you in. Don’t press the red button please, but don’t worry, it’s all clearly labelled.
Q3
WOMAN:                 OK. And one more question – is parking available nearby? We’re driving in from out of town.
MAN:                       Your best bet is to leave your car at the back of the
library
– on a Saturday morning there are plenty of spaces there. It’s right next door to the museum.
Q4
WOMAN:                 And can I ask about booking places?
MAN:                       Yes, and I must tell you, you really should book by calling the
education department
here.
Q5
WOMAN:                 Oh, I’m sorry, should I have rung them instead of the main museum number?
MAN:                       No, that’s fine this time, please don’t worry. But for future reference, I’ll give you the direct number. It’s two hundred-seven-six-five.
WOMAN:                 Great, I’ve got that.
MAN:                       But I’m very happy to give you information about the next two workshops. On Saturday the 16th there’s Building
Castles
.
Q6
WOMAN:                 Oh, sounds great!
MAN:                       This involves quite a bit of glue, so just make sure the kids are in
old clothes
.
Q7
WOMAN:                 I know, ones I don’t mind getting mucky.
MAN:                       Exactly. And if possible, could you bring along
bottle tops
which the children might be able to use in the models, you know, as decoration?
Q8
WOMAN:                 We’ll certainly try to find some for you.
MAN:                       Then the following week…
WOMAN:                 That’ll be the 23rd, won’t it?
MAN:                       Yes, that’s right. On that day, it’s what we call
Undersea Worlds
. This is where they make scenes with fishes, underground caverns and so on.
Q9
WOMAN:                 Is that likely to get very dirty? Lots of paint splashes?
MAN:                       Not really, so we don’t recommend any special clothes for that one. But if you could search out some
silver paper
to bring along to use in the sessions, you know, it’s shiny – it looks like water, that’d be great.
Q10
WOMAN:                 Yes, of course. We’ll see what we can come up with. Well, thank you ever so much for all your help. The sessions sound really good and I’ll certainly book up for the next two.
MAN:                       Lovely. Thanks very much for ringing.
WOMAN:                 Bye.
MAN:                       Bye-bye.

原文
TC employee:
Hi. Can I help you?
VISITOR:
I’d like to find out if you have any excursions suitable for families?
TC employee:
Sure. How about taking your family for a
cruise
?
We have a steamship that takes passengers out several times a day – it’s over 100 year’s old.
VISITOR:
That sounds interesting.
How long is the trip?
TC employee:
About an hour and a half.
And don’t forget to take pictures of the
mountains (Q1)
. T
hey’re all around you when you are on the boat and they look fantastic.
VISITOR:
Ok. And I assume there’s a café or something on board?
TC employee:
Sure. How old are your children?
VISITOR:
Er, my daughter’s 15 and my son’s 7.
TC employee:
Right. Well there are various things you can do once you’ve crossed the lake, to make a day of it.
One thing that’s very popular is a visit to the Country Farm.
You’re met off the boat by the farmer and he’ll take you to the holding pens, where the sheep are kept.
Children love feeding them!
VISITOR:
My son would love that.
He really likes animals.
TC employee:
Well, there’s also a 40-munite
trek
round the farm on the
horse (Q2)
, if he wants.
VISITOR:
Do you think he’d manage it?
He hasn’t done that before.
TC employee:
Sure. It’s suitable for complete beginners.
VISITOR:
Ah, good.
TC employee:
And again, visitors are welcome to explore the farm on their own, as long as they take care to close gates and so on.
There are some very beautiful
gardens (Q3)
along the side of the lake which also belong to the farm – they’ll be just at their best now.
You could easily spend an hour or two there.
VISITOR:
Ok. Well that all sounds good.
And can we get
lunch (Q4)
there?
TC employee:
You can, and it’s very good, though it’s not included in the basic cost.
You pay when you get there.
VISITOR:
Right.
VISITOR:
So is there anything else to do over that side of the lake?
TC employee:
Well, what you can do is take a bike over on the ship and then go on cycling trip.
There’s a
trail
there called the Back Road – you could easily spend three or four hours exploring it, and the scenery’s wonderful.
They’ll give you a
map (Q5)
when you get your ticket for the
cruise
– there’s no extra charge.
VISITOR:
What’s the
trail
like in terms of difficulty?
TC employee:
Quite challenging in places.
It wouldn’t be suitable for your seven-year-old.
It needs someone who’s got a bit more
experience (Q6)
.
VISITOR:
Hmm. Well, my daughter loves cycling and so do I, so maybe the two of us could go, and my wife and son could stay on the farm.
That might work out quite well.
But we don’t have bikes here…is there somewhere we could rent them?
TC employee:
Yes, there’s a place here in the city.
It’s called Ratchesons.
VISITOR:
I’ll just make a note of that, er, how do you spell it?
TC employee:
R-A-T-C-H-E-S-O-N-S (Q7)
.
It’s just by the
cruise
ship terminal.
VISITOR:
OK.
TC employee:
You’d also need to pick up a repair kit for the bike from there to take along with you, and you’d need to take along a snack and some water – it’d be best to get those in the city.
VISITOR:
Fine. That shouldn’t be a problem.
And I assume I can rent a
helmet
(Q8)
from the bike place?
TC employee:
Sure, you should definitely get that.
It’s a great ride, but you want to be well prepared because it’s very remote-you won’t see any
shops (Q9)
round there, or anywhere to stay, so you need to get back in time for the last boat.
VISITOR:
Yeah. So what sort of prices are we looking at here?
TC employee:
Let’s see, that’d be one adult and one child for
cruise
with farm tour, that’s ＄117, and an adult and a child for the
cruise
only so that’s ＄214 dollars
altogether
.
Oh, wait a minute, how old did you say your daughter was?
VISITOR:
15.
TC employee:
Then I’m afraid it’s ＄
267 (Q10)
because she has to pay the adult fare, which is ＄75 instead of the child fare which is ＄22 – sorry about that.
VISITOR:
That’s Ok. Er, so how do…

原文
MIKE: Hi Sue.
SUE: Hi Mike, so what happened to you last week?
MIKE: Oh, I was sick with the flu. What’s this I hear about a big assignment we’ve got to do?
SUE: Well, basically, we’ve got to find two science experiments to do with a group of eight-year-old children at the local primary school, and we’ve got to complete it by the end of the week.
MIKE: Oh, that sounds like hard work. Where are we supposed to get the ideas for these experiments from?
SUE: Well, I managed to get hold of two books from the library.
MIKE: Oh, well done!
SUE: How about if we take a look at the experiments in this book first and see if anything looks suitable? I can make notes as we go, about equipment and the purpose of the experiments.
MIKE: OK, let’s see, um, the first experiment is called ‘Make your own hovercraft’, which sounds very ambitious! Mind you, you only need
twenty balloons
and a table – you don’t need any special engines or anything like that!
Q21
SUE: What do you do with it all?
MIKE: Er, you blow up the balloons and you balance the table on them, upside down of course, and the kids get to ride around on it. You know, the other kids sort of push them around the room. The main purpose is to show how hovercrafts work, and how things hover around on just a cushion of air.
SUE: OK, that doesn’t sound too bad.
MIKK: OK, ready for number two?
SUE: Uh – huh.
MIKE: Now this one is called ‘Unusual Measures of Lengths’, and you basically use lots of paperclips. The kids go around the class measuring things – you know, how long the desk is, and that sort of thing, um, and then they all compare their answers. Er, and, basically, because not all paperclips are the same lengths, they should come up with some strange answers. It’s supposed to demonstrate the importance of having fixed
units of measurement
.
Q22
SUE: Hmm, yes, that’s not bad.
MIKE: OK, now for number three you need
rock salt
or copper sulphate.
Q23
SUE: Oh, I’m not sure about that!
MIKE: Well, just put down the rock salt then, um, apart from that you only need ajar of water. Um, and basically you dissolve lots of salt into the water and watch the crystals form, so it basically teaches the kids about growing
crystals
.
Q24
SUE: I suppose it would be nice to grow something. Hmm, let’s move on and have a look at number four.
MIKE: OK, this one is called ‘Spinning color wheel’. It looks like you get some cardboard and draw a circle on it, divide it into six equal segments and color each one in using different colors, then you thread a
piece of string
through the middle.
Q25
SUE: So we’d need some string as well.
MIKE: Yes, sorry… um… and you spin the wheel around and if you can get it spinning fast enough, hopefully the colors all merge and show up as white.
SUE: Oh, I didn’t know that. What’s the principle behind it?
MIKE: Well it’s pretty elementary physics, really. It teaches them about how
white light or ordinary light
is made up.
Q26
SUE: Hmm, well that doesn’t sound too bad. Now there’s only one more left in this book isn’t there? What does that one say?
MIKE: Um, well it’s another one where they’d get to make something.
SUE: Sounds very interesting.
MIKE: You need quite a lot of equipment actually – a hand drill, an old record, a pin or needle, some paper and a bolt.
SUE: Hmm, go on, what do they have to do?
MIKE: Well, they basically make a record player. The main idea is to teach them about recording sound, but hopefully, they’d also see that you need motion and an amplifier to make the sound heard.
SUE: OK, well it does sound interesting. Shall we go through all of those again and decide if any of them are going to be suitable?
MIKE: Right, number one. I thought this one sounded nice: there’d be lots of activity and it doesn’t need too much in the way of equipment.
SUE: Yes, that’s true, but don’t you think it’s
a bit risky
to get a group of eight-year-olds pushing each other around a classroom like that? Someone could get hurt. No, I don’t like the sound of that one at all!
Q27
MIKE: Maybe you’re right.
SUE: What about number two, with the paperclips? It sounds tame enough.
MIKE: Yes, a bit too tame if you ask me. I think it needs to be something
a bit more active and interesting
than that, don’t you?
Q28
SUE: Yes, I suppose you’re right. We won’t get a very good mark if the children don’t actually enjoy the experiments, and I suppose we could turn them off science for good! Well, what about the next one, number three?
MIKE: Now, I quite like the idea of this one.
SUE: Yes, so do I, but I seem to remember when we did it at high school we
had to wait up to a fortnight
before we saw any halfway decent results.
Q29
MIKE: Oh, yes well, that won’t be any good then. We’ll only see the kids for one or two hours at the most.
SUE: Yes, and we have to do the experiments and write up our results within a week, so that one won’t do at all.
MIKE: OK, well, what did you think of number four?
SUE: I like the idea of it, but do you think it will be a bit elementary for them?
MIKE: Well they are only eight you know!
SUE: I know, but you know what I mean. Don’t you think the activity itself is a bit babyish?
MIKE: Hmm, maybe you’re right.
SUE: They might have fun but, I mean, cutting out a circle and coloring it in?
MIKE: OK, well, what about number five?
SUE: I thought this one sounded a bit too good to be true – great equipment!
MIKE: Yeah.
SUE: But don’t you think it’s
a bit ambitious
for this age group? I mean, I don’t want to start off something and then have to abandon it if they just can’t cope with it. I could see us ending up doing just about all of the work for them.
Q30
MIKE: I guess you’re right. Oh well, maybe we could store that idea away for later.
SUE: Yep, let’s hope this second book has something better!

剑桥雅思14 test3 section4
雅思听力
原文
As you all know, the university is planning an arts festival for later this year, and here in the music department we’ve planned three concerts. These will be public performances, and the programme has just been finalised. The theme of the festival is links between the UK and Australia, and this is reflected in the music: each concert will feature both British and Australian composers. I’ll tell you briefly about the Australian music, as you probably won’t be familiar with that.
The first concert will include music by Liza Lim, who was born in Perth, Western Australia, in 1966. As a child, Lim originally learned to play the piano – like so many children – and also the
violin (Q31)
, but when she was 11 her teachers encouraged her to start composing. She found this was her real strength, and she studied and later taught composition, both in Australia and in other countries. As a composer, she has received commissions from numerous orchestras, other performers and festivals in several countries.
Liza Lim’s compositions are vibrant and full of
energy (Q32)
, and she often explores Asian and Australian Aboriginal cultural sources, including the native instrument, the didgeridoo: this is featured in a work called The Compass. Her music is very expressive, so although it is
complex (Q33)
, it has the power of connecting with audiences and performers alike.
In the festival we’re going to give a semi-staged performance of The Oresteia. This is an
opera (Q34)
in seven parts, based on the trilogy of ancient Greek tragedies by Aeschylus. Lim composed this when she was in her mid-20s, and she also wrote the text, along with Barrie Kosky. It’s performed by six singers, a dancer, and an orchestra that, as well as standard orchestral instruments, includes electric guitar, and a traditional Turkish stringed instrument. Lim wrote that because the stories in the tragedies are not easy to tell, the sounds she creates are also
disturbing (Q35)
, and they include breathing, sobbing, laughing and whistling. The work lasts around 75 minutes, and the rest of the concert will consist of orchestral works by the British composers Ralph Vaughan Williams and Frederick Delius.
Moving on now to our second concert, this will begin with instrumental music by British composers – Benjamin Britten and Judith Weir. After the interval we’ll go to Australia for a piece by Ross Edwards: The Tower of Remoteness. According to Edwards, the inspiration for this piece came from nature, when he was sitting alone in the dry bed of a creek, overshadowed by the leaves of palm trees, listening to the birds and insects. The Tower of Remoteness is scored for piano and
clarinet (Q36)
. Edwards says he realised years after writing the piece that he had subconsciously modelled its opening phrase on a bird call.
Ross Edwards was born in 1943 in Sydney, Australia, and studied at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music and the universities of Adelaide and Sydney. He’s well known in Australia, and in fact he’s one of the country’s most performed composers. He’s written a wide range of music, from symphonies and concertos to some composed specifically for children. Edwards’s music has been described as being ‘deeply connected to Australia’, and it can be regarded as a celebration of the
diversity (Q37)
of cultures that Australia can be proud of.
The last of the three Australian composers to be represented in our festival is Carl Vine. Born in 1954, Vine, like Liza Lim, comes from Perth, Western Australia. He took up the cornet at the age of five, switching to the piano five years later. However, he went to university to study
physics (Q38)
, before changing to composition. After graduating he moved to Sydney and worked as a freelance pianist and composer. Before long he had become prominent in Australia as a composer for
dance (Q39)
, and in fact has written 25 scores of that type.
In our third concert, Vine will be represented by his music for the flag hand-over ceremony of the
Olympics (Q40)
held in 1996. This seven-minute orchestral piece was of course heard by millions of people worldwide, and we’ll hear it alongside works written by British composers Edward Elgar and, more recently, Thomas Adès.

剑桥雅思17 Test3 Part2
雅思听力
原文
Good afternoon. My name’s Mrs Carter and I run the before and after school extended hours childcare service. I hope you’ve had a chance to have a good look around the school and talk to staff and pupils. I know that many of you are interested in using our childcare service when your child joins the school, and perhaps you already know something about it, but for those that don’t, I’ll go through the main details now.
We offer childcare for children from the ages of four to eleven both before and after school. I know that many parents who work find this service invaluable. You can leave your child with us safe in the knowledge that they will be extremely well cared for.
We are insured to provide care for up to 70 children (Q11)
, although we rarely have this many attending at any one session.
I think we generally expect around 50–60 children for the
afternoon sessions and about half that number for the breakfast sessions (Q12)
. Although we currently do have 70 children registered with us, not all of these attend every day. It’s ten years since we began offering an extended hours service and we’ve come a long way during that time. When we first opened, we only had about 20 children attending regularly.
We try to keep our costs as low as we can and we think we provide very good value for money.
For the afternoon sessions, which run from 3.30 until 6 p.m., it’s £7.20 (Q13)
. But if you prefer, you can pay for one hour only, which costs £3.50, or two hours which costs £5.70.
The cost of the childcare includes food and snacks. They’ll be given breakfast in the morning and in the afternoon, a healthy snack as soon as they finish school.
At 5 p.m. children are given something more substantial, such as pasta or a casserole (Q14)
. Please inform us of any allergies that your child might have and we’ll make sure they’re offered a suitable alternative.
As you may know, the childcare service runs through the school holidays from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. We offer a really varied and exciting programme to keep the children entertained – we don’t want them to feel as if they are still at school! It will also feel different because
they’ll get the chance to make new friends with children from other schools (Q15)
– spaces are available for them because a lot of our term-time children don’t always attend during the holiday. In the past, parents have asked if children over the age of 11 are allowed to come with their younger brothers and sisters – but I’m afraid we’re unable to do this because of the type of insurance we have.
So now let me tell you about some of the activities that your child can do during the after school sessions. As well as being able to use the playground equipment, computers and the library, there is usually at least one ‘special’ activity that children can do each day. For example, Spanish. We have a specialist teacher coming in every Thursday to give a basic introduction to the language through games and songs. She does two sessions: one for the over 8s and one for the younger children.
This is the only activity which we have to make an extra charge for (Q16)
– but it’s well worth it.
Once a week the children have the opportunity to do some music. We’re very lucky that one of our staff is a member of a folk band. On Mondays, she teaches singing and percussion to groups of children.
We do rely on parental support for this (Q17)
, so if any of you sing or play an instrument and would be prepared to help out at these sessions, we’d be delighted.
Painting continues to be one of the most popular activities. To begin with we weren’t keen on offering this because of the extra mess involved,
but children kept asking if they could do
some art (Q18)
and so we finally gave in. Art is great for helping the children to relax after working hard at school all day.
Yoga is something that we’ve been meaning to introduce for some time but haven’t been able to find anyone available to teach it – until now that is (Q19)
. So we’ll see how this goes. Hopefully, children will benefit in all sorts of ways from this.
Cooking is another popular activity. They make a different sort of cake, or pizza or bread each week. Although the younger children love doing it, we found that the mess was just too much,
so we’ve decided to restrict this to the over 8s (Q20)
, as they are better able to clean up after themselves

原文
Holly:
Hello Dr Green – I’m here to talk to you about my work placement.
Tutor:
Oh yes, it’s Holly, isn’t it?
Holly:
Yes.
Tutor:
So, which work placement have you chosen?
Holly:
I decided to go for the Orion Stadium placement. The event I’ll be managing is one where I’m helping to set up a sports competition for primary school children.
Tutor:
Yup. That’s always a popular placement – even though it can be tougher than you think working with children.
Holly:
I know, but
it’s the fresh air that attracts me – organising something indoors doesn’t have the same appeal (Q21)
, even though it might be fun.
Tutor:
OK, so obviously safety’s going to be one of your key concerns for this event.
Holly:
Yes, I’ve already thought about that. I’ll need to make sure none of the equipment’s damaged.
Tutor:
Ah well, you’ll be working with schools, so the equipment will be their responsibility. However, the grounds and what goes on there will be yours.
Holly:
Oh I see –
that’ll include keeping everyone within the boundary (Q22)
once they’re in their kit and on the field?
Tutor:
Exactly – you’ll need to inspect areas like changing rooms as well for anything someone can trip over,
but your main priority will be not to lose anyone (Q22)
!
Holly:
Right. I’ll need staff to help with that.
Tutor:
And don’t forget about the spectators.
Holly:
Mmm. I was thinking that many of them will be parents, who could help run the event.
Tutor:
I wouldn’t rely on that. They’ll be more interested in filming their children than volunteering.
Holly:
I’ll need to make sure they don’t interfere with events doing that (Q23)
!
Tutor:
And that’s not always easy (Q23)
, especially when a proud parent’s trying to get a snap of their child and you want them to move elsewhere.
Holly:
OK. What about the scheduling?
Tutor:
With sporting events there are all sorts of things that can alter the timetable – like rain, for instance – though so far, we’ve always been lucky with that.
Holly:
Yeah, and I was thinking about
what to do if someone got hurt as well. I know that last year that caused a terrible delay (Q24)
.
Tutor:
You have to be prepared for such things.
Holly:
Oh. What if a match ends in a draw – do you let the teams keep going until someone wins?
Tutor:
That’ll be up to you – and again, you need to plan for it.
Holly:
Right.
Tutor:
Now, the aim of your work placement is to give you the opportunity to develop the skills that an events manager needs. So, let’s talk about those a bit.
Holly:
Well, I think my communication skills are pretty good. I can talk on the phone to people and book venues and that kind of thing.
Tutor:
Good – just remember it isn’t only about what you say.
If you meet someone face-to-face and want to persuade them to be a sponsor (Q25)
, for example …
Holly:
Oh,
I’ll dress up for that (Q25)
! Sure.
Tutor:
Good. Let’s go on to think about your organisational skills. You’re working in a very people-based industry and that means things won’t always go to plan.
Holly:
I guess
it’s being prepared to make changes that matters (Q26)
.
Tutor:
That’s right. You may have to make an on-the-spot change to a timetable because of a problem you hadn’t anticipated …
Holly:
… just do it! OK.
Tutor:
How’s your time management these days?
Holly:
I’m working on it – I’m certainly better when I have a deadline, which is why this work suits me.
Tutor:
Yes, but it’s how you respond as that deadline approaches!
Holly:
I know I’ve got to look calm even if I’m in a panic (Q27)
.
Tutor:
Just think to yourself – no one must know I’m under pressure.
Holly:
Yeah – even though I’m multi-tasking like crazy!
Tutor:
Another skill that events managers need is creativity. Often your client has what we call the ‘big picture’ idea, but it’s up to the events manager to
think of all the fine points that go to making it work (Q28)
.
Holly:
Right, so I need to listen carefully to that idea and then fill in all the gaps.
Tutor:
That’s right. And you’ll have a team working under you,  so another key skill is leadership. Your team may have lots of ideas too, but you’ve got to make the ultimate choices. Do we have refreshments inside or out, for example?
Holly:
Isn’t it better to be democratic?
Tutor:
It’s a nice idea, but you have the ultimate responsibility. So,
believe in what
you
think best (Q29)
. Be prepared to say ‘yes’, that’s a good idea but it won’t work here.
Holly:
I see what you mean. What about the networking side of things? I know it’s an area that a lot of students worry about because we don’t have much experience to offer others.
Tutor:
But even without it – you can still be an interesting person with useful ideas. And the more people you impress, the better.
Holly:
I guess that will help me when I apply for a real job.
Tutor:
Exactly – think ahead (Q30)
– remember what your ambitions are and keep them in mind.
Holly:
Definitely

原文
Good morning. My name’s Lucy Crittenden, and I’m the Director of Operations for an organisation that arranges volunteering in this part of the country. I’m hoping I can persuade one or two of you to become volunteers yourselves. Let me start by briefly explaining what we mean by volunteering.
Volunteers are teenagers and adults who choose to spend some time, unpaid, helping other people in some way. Most volunteers devote two or three hours to this every week, while a few do much more. The people they help may have physical or behavioural difficulties, for example.
Volunteers can do all sorts of things, depending on their own abilities and interests. If they’re supporting a family that’s struggling, for example, they may be able to give them tips on cooking, or recommend how to plan their budget or how to shop sensibly on their income. They might even do
some painting or wallpapering (Q11)
, perhaps alongside any members of the family who are able to do it. Or even do
some babysitting (Q12)
so that parents can go out for a while.
The benefit from volunteering isn’t only for the people being helped. Volunteers also gain from it: they’re using their skills to cope with somebody’s mental or physical ill health, and
volunteering may be a valuable element of their CV when they’re applying for jobs (Q13)
: employers usually look favourably on someone who’s given up time to help others. Significantly,
most volunteers feel that what they’re doing gives them a purpose in their lives (Q14)
. And in my opinion, they’re lucky in that respect, as many people don’t have that feeling.
Now I’d like to tell you what some of our volunteers have said about what they do, to give you an idea of the range of ways in which they can help people.
Habib supports an elderly lady who’s beginning to show signs of dementia. Once a week they, along with other elderly people, go to the local community centre, where a group of people come in and sing. The songs
take the listeners back to their youth (Q15)
, and for a little while they can forget the difficulties that they face now.
Our volunteer Consuela is an amazing woman.
She has difficulty walking herself, but she doesn’t let that stop her
. She helps a couple of people with similar difficulties, who had almost stopped walking altogether.
By using herself as an example. Consuela encourages them to walk more and more (Q16)
.
Minh visits a young man who lives alone and can’t leave his home on his own, so he hardly ever saw anyone. But together
they go out to the cinema, or to see friends (Q17)
the young man hadn’t been able to visit for a long time.
Tanya visits an elderly woman once a week. When the woman found out that Tanya is a professional dressmaker, she got interested. Tanya showed her some soft toys she’d made, and
the woman decided to try it herself (Q18)
. And now she really enjoys it, and spends hours making toys. They’re not perhaps up to Tanya’s standard yet, but she gains a lot of pleasure from doing it.
Alexei is a volunteer with a family that faces a number of difficulties. By calmly talking over possible solutions with family members, he’s helping them to realise that they aren’t helpless, and that
they can do something themselves to improve their situation (Q19)
. This has been great for their self-esteem.
And the last volunteer I’ll mention, though there are plenty more, is Juba. She volunteers with a teenage girl with learning difficulties, who wasn’t very good at talking to other people. Juba’s worked very patiently with her, and
now the girl is far better at expressing herself, and at understanding other people (Q20)
.
OK, I hope that’s given you an idea of what volunteering is all about. Now I’d like …

剑桥雅思11Test3Section2听力答案解析 Changes in Barford over the last 50 years
剑桥雅思11 test3 section2
雅思听力
原文
MAN: First of all, let me thank you all for coming to this public meeting, to discuss the future of our town.
Our first speaker is Shona Ferguson, from Barford town council.
Shona.
SHONA: Thank you.
First I’ll briefly give you some background information, then I’ll be asking you for your comments on developments in the town.
Well, as you don’t need me to tell you, Barford has changed a great deal in the last 50 years.
These are some of the main changes.
Fifty years ago, buses linked
virtually
every part of the town and the neighbouring towns and villages.
Most people used them frequently, but not now, because the bus companies concentrate on just the routes that attract most passengers.
So parts of the town are no longer served by buses (Q11)
.
Even replacing old uncomfortable buses with smart new ones has had little impact on passenger numbers.
It’s sometimes said that bus fares are too high, but in relation to average incomes, fares are not much higher than they were 50 years ago.
Changes in the road network are affecting the town.
The centre was recently closed to traffic on a trial basis, making it much safer for pedestrians.
The impact of this is being measured.
The new cycle paths, separating bikes from cars in most main roads, are being used far more than was expected, reducing traffic and improving air quality (Q12)
.
And although the council’s attempts to have a bypass constructed have failed, we haven’t given up hope of persuading the government to change its mind.
Shopping in the town centre has changed over the years.
Many of us can remember when the town was crowded with people going shopping.
Numbers have been falling for several years, despite efforts to attract shoppers, for
instance
by opening new car parks.
Some people combine shopping with visits to the town’s restaurants and cafes. .
Most shops are small independent stores, which is good, but many people prefer to use supermarkets and department stores in nearby large towns,
as there are so few well-known chain stores here (Q13)
.
Turning now to medical facilities, the town is served by family doctors in several medical practices – fewer than 50 years ago, but each
catering
for far more patients.
Our hospital closed 15 years ago (Q14)
, which means journeys to other towns are
unavoidable
.
On the other hand, there are more dentists than there used to be.
Employment patterns have changed, along with almost everything else.
The number of schools and colleges has increased, making that the main employment sector (Q15)
.
Services, such as website design and
accountancy
, have grown in importance, and surprisingly, perhaps,
manufacturing
hasn’t seen the decline that has affected it in other parts of the country.
Now I’ll very quickly
outline
current plans for some of the town’s facilities, before asking for your comments.
As you’ll know if you regularly use the car park at the railway station, it’s usually full.
The railway company applied for permission to replace it with a multi-storey car park, but that was refused.
Instead,
the company has bought some adjoining land, and this will be used to increase the number of Parking spaces (Q16)
.
The Grand, the old cinema in the high street, will close at the end of the year, and reopen on a different site (Q17)
.
You’ve probably seen the building under construction.
The plan is to have three screens with fewer seats, rather than just the one large
auditorium
in the old cinema.
I expect many of you shop in the indoor market.
It’s become more and more shabby- looking, and because of fears about safety, it was threatened with
demolition
.
The good news is that it will close for six weeks to be made safe and redecorated, and the improved building will open in July (Q18)
.
Lots of people use the library, including school and college students who go there to study.
The council has managed to secure funding to keep the library open later into the evening, twice a week (Q19)
.
We would like to enlarge the building in the not-too-distant future, but this is by no means definite.
There’s no limit on access to the nature reserve on the edge of town, and this will continue to be the case.
What will change, though, is that the council will no longer be in charge of the area.
Instead it will become the responsibility of a national body that administers most nature reserves in the country (Q20)
.
OK, now let me ask you …

剑桥雅思8Test4听力Section4答案解析 Australian Aboriginal Rock Paintings
剑8 test 4Section 4
雅思听力
原文
Good morning, everyone. I’ve been invited to talk about my research project into Australian Aboriginal rock paintings. The Australian Aborigines have recorded both real and symbolic images of their time on rock walls for many thousands of years. Throughout the long history of this tradition, new images have appeared and new painting styles have developed. And these characteristics can be used to categorise the different artistic styles. Among these are what we call the Dynamic, Yam and Modern styles of painting.
One of the most significant characteristics of the different styles is the way that humans are depicted in the paintings. The more recent paintings show people in static poses. But the first human images to dominate rock art paintings, over 8, 000 years ago, were full of movement. These paintings showed people hunting and cooking food and so they were given the name ‘Dynamic’ to reflect this energy. It’s quite amazing considering they were painted in such a simple stick-like form. In the Yam period, there was a movement away from stick figures to a more naturalistic shape. However, they didn’t go as far as the
Modern style, which is known as ‘x-ray’ because it actually makes a feature of the internal skeleton (Q31)
as well as the organs of animals and humans.
The Yam style of painting got its name from the fact that it featured much curvier figures (Q32)
that actually resemble the vegetable called a yam, which is similar to a sweet potato.
The Modern paintings are interesting because they include paintings at the time of the first contact with European settlers. Aborigines managed to convey the idea of the settlers’ clothing by simply painting the Europeans without any hands (Q33)
, indicating the habit of standing with their hands in their pockets! Size is another characteristic. The more recent images tend to be life size or even larger, but the
Dynamic figures are painted in miniature (Q34)
.
Aboriginal rock art also records the environmental changes that occurred over thousands of years. For example, we know from the Dynamic paintings that over 8, 000 years ago, Aborigines would have rarely eaten fish and sea levels were much lower at this time. In fact,
fish didn’t start to appear in paintings until the Yam period along with shells and other marine images (Q35)
.
The paintings of the Yam tradition also suggest that, during this time, the Aborigines moved away from animals as their main food source and began including vegetables in their diet, as these feature prominently (36).
Freshwater creatures didn’t appear in the paintings until the Modern period from 4, 000 years ago.
So, these paintings have already taught us a lot. But one image that has always intrigued us is known as the ‘Rainbow Serpent’. The Rainbow Serpent, which is the focus of my most recent project, gets its name from its snake or serpent-like body and it first appeared in the Yam period 4 to 6, 000 years ago. Many believe it is a curious mixture of kangaroo, snake and crocodile. But we decided to study the Rainbow Serpent paintings to see if we could locate the
animal (Q37)
that the very first painters based their image on.
The Yam period coincided with the end of the last ice age. This brought about tremendous change in the environment, with the
sea levels rising (Q38)
, and creeping steadily inland. This flooded many familiar land features and also caused a great deal of disruption to traditional patterns of life,
hunting (Q39)
in particular. New shores were formed and totally different creatures would have washed up onto the shores. We studied 107 paintings of the Rainbow Serpent and found that the one creature that matches it most closely was the Ribboned Pipefish, which is a type of sea horse. This sea creature would have been a totally unfamiliar sight in the inland regions where the image is found and may have been the inspiration behind the early paintings.
So, at the end of the ice age there would have been enormous changes in animal and plant life. It’s not surprising then, that the Aborigines linked this abundance to the new creatures they witnessed. Even today, Aborigines see the Rainbow Serpent as a symbol of
creation (Q40)
, which is understandable given the increase in vegetation and the new life forms that featured when the image first appeared.

这10道题目是在真正考试中十分常见的住宿场景。里面提到了跟谁住，具体的住宿类型，相关费用等问题。词汇的难度倒是不大，大家的练习重点可以放在熟悉相关问题和回答上。
其中的易错点主要有两个。一是第一道题的1.5 years，需要大家自己将这名女生在澳大利亚的两段经历加起来，比较麻烦一些。不过可以放心的是，这种需要我们自己计算的题目在最近7,8年都没有出现过了。二是第10题的phone。这个单词的发音有些奇怪，不少同学听得都是fine，需要额外注意一下。

原文
LYNDA: Sara, I’ve heard that you want to move into a homestay family. Is that correct?
SARA: Yes, that’s right. I’ve been staying with my aunt and now my cousin is arriving from Singapore and my aunt needs the room for him.
LYNDA: Oh, that’s bad luck. Well, I’ll need to get some particulars first. Sara, what’s your full name?
SARA:
Sara Lim
, and that’s Sara without the ‘h’ at the end.
Example
LYNDA: Mmm. How old are you, Sara?
SARA: Twenty-three, only just. It was my birthday on the twenty-first of August.
LYNDA: Happy birthday for yesterday. How long have you been in Australia?
SARA:
A year in Adelaide and six months in Sydney
. I prefer Sydney, I’ve got more friends here.
Q1
LYNDA: What’s your address at your aunt’s house?
SARA: Flat one, five three nine
Forest
Road, Canterbury. And the postcode is two, o, three, six.
Q2
LYNDA: OK. What are you studying now?
SARA: I was studying General English in Adelaide and now I’m doing
Academic
English, because I’m trying to get into Medicine next year.
Q3
LYNDA: That sounds good, but it’ll take you a long time. When would you like to move out from your aunt’s?
SARA: My cousin arrives on Friday morning, so I’d better be out on
Thursday
.
Q4
LYNDA: What, the seventh of September?
SARA: Yes, that’s right.
LYNDA: That doesn’t leave us much time. Right, OK. I need to know what kind of accommodation you’d like, so I can get you something suitable.
SARA: Can I
share a room
with someone else? I’ve been alone in my room at my aunt’s and I’ve always shared with my sister and I like that.
Q5
LYNDA: Yes, fine. That’ll save you money too. Would you like to live with a family or do you think that a
single person
would be better for you? I have lots of very nice single people on my books.
Q6
SARA: DO you have any women living alone, retired women?
LYNDA: Yes, I have quite a few whose children have grown up and left home. In fact, I have some really lovely retired ladies, living by themselves, who just love the company of students. Most of them live in
flats
, but that’s not a problem for you, is it?
Q7
SARA: Not at all. I’m used to that. My aunt lives in a flat too, remember. I’m not used to a big house with a garden, swimming pool, pets and all that.
LYNDA: OK, fine. I know quite a bit about what you want now. I should let you know that your rent will be a hundred and sixty dollars per week. You’ll have to pay me three hundred and twenty dollars as a
deposit
before you move in. The deposit is as insurance, in case you break something. You’ll need to pay
monthly
to me, by cash or cheque, I don’t mind. You don’t need to pay for gas, electricity or water, but you will need to pay your proportion of the
phone
bill. Most families do that on an honor system, but you’ll have to wait and see.
Q8 Q9 Q10
SARA: Mmm.
LYNDA: Have you got any more questions for me?
SARA: When will you know where I can go?
LYNDA: I’ll work on it now, so come and see me tomorrow and I should have some news for you then.
SARA: Thanks a lot.
IYNDA: Goodbye. See you tomorrow – after lunch would be better for me.
SARA: OK, see you then. Bye.

原文
WOMAN
: Can I help you?
MAN
: Yes, I’ve just moved to this area with my wife and children and I’d like to know where we can all register with a doctor at a Health Centre.
WOMAN
: Okay. Well, there’s Doctor Green at The Harvey Clinic. We always recommend her for
babies (Q1)
,
because she’s very good with them and she runs a special clinic.
MAN
: Oh … actually my youngest child is five, so that wouldn’t be any good for us.
WOMAN
: Right.
MAN
: Is there anywhere else I could try?
WOMAN
: Yes, the
Eshcol (Q2)
Health Practice is the next one on my list.
MAN
: How do you spell that?
WOMAN
: E-S-H-C-O-L. And it’s Doctor Fuller, who has space on his list. The clinic only opened a year ago, so the facilities are all very modern.
MAN
: That sounds good.
WOMAN
: And it’s particularly good if you’re busy during the day, because they also do appointments in the
evening (Q3)
. They’re closed on Saturday, though. The only other place on the list is the Health Centre on Shore Lane. You can register with Doctor
Gormley (Q4)
, that’s G-O-R-M-L-E-Y. He’s new there, but the centre has a very good reputation.
MAN
: Oh yes, I think I know the road. That would be the best one. Thanks. Could you tell me, will all their services be free?
WOMAN
:  Erm … there are usually some small charges that doctors make. Let me see what it says about the Shore Lane Centre.
If you need to be vaccinated before any trips abroad, you won’t have to pay for this (Q5)
. Erm, what else? The sports injury treatment service operates on a paying basis, as does the nutritional therapy service. Some health centres do offer alternative therapies like homeopathy as part of their pay-to-use service. Shore Lane are hoping to do this soon – I think they may start with acupuncture. And finally,
if you need to prove you’re healthy or haven’t had any serious injuries before a new employer will accept you, you can get a free fitness check-up there (Q6)
,
but you’d most likely have to pay for insurance medicals though.
MAN
: Okay, thanks.
WOMAN
: You might also be interested to know the Centre is running a pilot scheme of talks for patients. I’ve got the list here. Actually, they look very interesting.
MAN
: What sort of things?
WOMAN
: Well, the first one’s about giving up smoking. It’s next week, the twenty-fifth of February, at 7 pm, and that’s in Room 4. It says, the talk will stress the health benefits particularly for people with asthma or
heart (Q7)
disease.
MAN: That sounds very interesting.
WOMAN
: There’s also a talk for families with children. It’s on Healthy Eating, and takes place on the first of March at five o’clock.
MAN
: Will that be at the Health Centre?
WOMAN
: Erm, actually it’s at the
primary
school
(Q8)
on Shore Lane. I imagine they’re inviting the parents of pupils there – it says here ‘all welcome’.
MAN
: Mmm, I might go to that if I have time.
WOMAN
: There’s a couple of other talks – one giving advice about how to avoid injuries while doing exercise. It’s on the ninth of March. Oh, it’s a late afternoon talk, at
four thirty (Q9)
, and it’ll be in Room 6. It also says the talk is suitable for all
ages (Q10)

ANDREW: Excuse me, I was told to come here for advice about, erm, Management Diploma courses?
MONICA: You’ve certainly come to the right place. Hi, my name is Monica.
ANDREW: Nice to meet you. My name is Andrew, Andrew Harris.
MONICA: So, Andrew, have you seen our diploma course prospectus yet?
ANDREW: Yes, I’ve already looked at it. In fact, I thought the information on course content was really useful, but I’m afraid I’m a bit confused by all the different ways you can do the course: full-time intensive, part-time and so on.
MONICA: Well, let’s see if I can help. I think each course type has its advantages and disadvantages, so it really depends on you – your own study habits, and your financial circumstances, of course. Are you working at the moment?
ANDREW: Yes. I’ve been working in the administration section of the local hospital for the last
three years
. And before that I worked in the office of a computer engineering company for two years. So, I’ve got about five years of relevant work experience. And what I’m hoping to focus on is Personnel Management.
Q21
MONICA: I see. And are you planning to leave your current job to study, or are you thinking about just taking a year off?
ANDREW: I want to know what my options are, really. I don’t want to quit my job or anything and my employers are keen for me to get some more qualifications but obviously, it would be better if I could do a course without taking too much time away from work.
MONICA: Right, so you don’t really want to do the full-time course, then?
ANDREW: No, not really. It’s also a question of finances. You see, my office has agreed to pay
the cost of the course itself
, but I would have to take unpaid leave if I want to study full-time and, well, I don’t think I could afford to support myself with no salary for a whole year.
Q22
MONICA: OK. Well, you have two other possibilities: you could either do the part-time course – that would be over
two years
and you wouldn’t have to take any time off work – or you could do what we call a ‘modular’ course. You could do that in eighteen months if you wanted – or longer, it’s quite flexible and it would be up to you.
Q23
ANDREW: Mmm. So what does the part-time course involve?
MONICA: For that you would join an evening class and have a lecture twice a week. Then, you’d have to attend a seminar or discussion workshop one weekend a month.
ANDREW: What kind of coursework would I have to do?
MONICA: Well, it’s a mixture. You’d be expected to write
an essay
each month, which counts towards your final assessment. You have a case study to do by the end of the course, which might involve doing a survey or something like that, and also you need to hand in
a short report
every four weeks.
Q24/Q25
ANDREW: So, that’s quite a lot of work, then, on top of working every day. It sounds like a lot of studying – and really tiring.
MONICA: Yes, you certainly wouldn’t have much free time!
ANDREW: What about the ‘modular’ course? What would I have to do for that?
MONICA: That’s where you get the opportunity to study
full-time
for short periods. That way you can cover a lot of coursework and attend lectures and seminars during the day. And each module lasts for
one term
, say, about twelve weeks at a time. There are obvious advantages in this – the main one being that you can study in a much more
intensive
way, which suits some people much better.
Q26, Q27, Q28
ANDREW: And how many of these ‘modules’ would I have to do to get the diploma?
MONICA: The current programme is
two modules
– and then you have to choose
a topic
to work in more depth – but you can base that on your job, and so you don’t need to be away from the office, and how long it takes is up to you. The important thing is that you don’t have to study and work. You can focus on one thing at a time.
Q29, Q30
ANDREW: Yes, I can see that. It certainly sounds attractive! It would be more expensive, though. I mean, I’d have to support myself without pay for each module.
MONICA: That’s true, so that might be a problem for you. Look, why don’t you talk this over with your employers and …

Oh, hello, um, my name’s Dan and I’d like to join your club.
BREDA:
That’s great, Dan. We have an application form – would you like to complete it over the phone, then you can ask any questions you might have?
DAN:
Oh, yes, thanks.
BREDA:
OK, so what’s your family name? It’s Green-Dan Green.
DAN:
So – can I take your email address? Yes, it’s dan1068@market.com.
BREDA:
Thanks. And what about your home address?
DAN:
Well, I’m about ten miles away from your club in Peacetown. I live in a house there.
BREDA:
OK, so what’s the house number and street?
DAN:
It’s 52
Marrowfield (Q1)
Street.
BREDA:
Is that M-A double R-O-W-F-I-E-L-D?
DAN:
That’s right.
BREDA:
.. and that’s Peacetown, you said?
DAN:
Uhuh.
BREDA:
So how did you hear about our club? Did you look on the internet?
DAN:
I usually do that, but this time, well, I was talking to a
relative (Q2)
the other day and he suggested it.
BREDA:
Oh, is he a member too?
DAN:
He belongs to another club – but he’d heard good things about yours.
BREDA:
OK. So what do you hope to get from joining?
DAN:
Well, one thing that really interests me is the competitions that you have. I enjoy entering those.
BREDA:
Right. Anything else?
DAN:
Well, I also like to
socialise (Q3)
with other photographers. That’s great. So what type of membership would you like? What are the options?
BREDA:
It’s 30 pounds a year for
full (Q4)
membership or 20 pounds a year if you’re an associate.
DAN:
I think I’ll go for the full membership, then.
BREDA:
That’s a good idea because you can’t vote in meetings with an associate membership.
BREDA:
If I could just find out a bit more about you…
DAN:
OK.
BREDA:
So you said you wanted to compete – have you ever won any photography competitions?
DAN:
Not yet, but I have entered three in the past.
BREDA:
Oh, that’s interesting. So why don’t you tell me something about those? Let’s start with the first one.
DAN:
Well, the theme was entitled ‘
Domestic (Q5)
Life’.
BREDA:
I see – so it had to be something related to the home?
DAN:
Yeah. I chose to take a photo of a family sitting round the dinner table having a meal,  and, um, I didn’t win, but I did get some feedback.
BREDA:
Oh, what did the judges say?
DAN:
That it was too ‘busy’ as a picture.
BREDA:
Aha- so it was the composition of the picture that they criticised?
DAN:
That’s right – and once they’d told me that, I could see my mistake.
BREDA:
So what was the theme of the second competition?
DAN:
Well, my university was on the coast and that area gets a lot of beautiful sunsets, so that was the theme.
BREDA:
Oh, sunsets, that’s a great theme.
DAN:
Yes. The instructions were to capture the
clouds (Q6)
as well – it couldn’t just be blue sky and a setting sun.
BREDA:
Sure, cause they give you all those amazing pinks and purples.
DAN:
Yeah – and I thought I’d done that well, but the feedback was that I should have waited a bit longer to get the shot.
BREDA:
I see. So the
timing (Q7)
wasn’t right.
DAN:
Yes – I took it too soon, basically. And then the third competition I entered was called ‘
Animal Magic
‘
(Q8)
.
BREDA:
Well, that’s a difficult subject!
DAN:
I know! I had to take hundreds of shots.
BREDA:
I’m sure – because animals move all the time.
DAN:
That’s what we had to show – there had to be some
movement (Q9)
in the scene. I got a great shot of a fox in the end, but I took it at night and, well, I suspected that it was a bit
dark (Q10)
, which is what I was told.
BREDA:
Well Dan – you seem to be really keen and we’d be delighted to have you in our club. I’m sure we can help with all those areas that you’ve outlined.

BOB: Are you looking for a

MARGARET: No,
temporary (Q1)
. I’ve got a
permanent
job starting in a few months’ time, and I want to do something else until then.
BOB: What work do you do?
MARGARET: This will probably sound crazy — I used to be a lawyer, and then I made complete career change,
and I’m going to be a
doctor (Q2)
. I’ve just finished my training.
BOB: Right. And have you had any experience of leading cycle trips?
MARGARET: Yes, I’ve led several bike tours in
Africa (Q3)
.
The trip to India that I had arranged to lead next month has now been cancelled, so when I saw you were advertising for tour leaders, I decided to apply.
BOB: OK. Now we normally have two or three leaders on a trip, depending on the size of the group.
Some tours are for very experienced cyclists, but we’ve got a tour coming up soon in Spain, which is proving so popular we need an additional leader.
It’s a cycling holiday for families. Would that suit you?
MARGARET: It certainly would. I enjoy working with children, and I probably need some more experience before I go on a really challenging trip.
BOB: That tour includes several teenagers: have you worked with that age group before?
MARGARET: Yes, I’m a volunteer worker in a
youth (Q4)
club, where I help people to improve their cycling skills.
MARGARET: Before that I helped out in a cycling club where I taught beginners.
BOB: Well that’s great. Now the trip I mentioned is just for a fortnight, but there might be the possibility of leading other tours after that.
Would that fit in with your plans?
MARGARET: That’d be fine. I’ll be free for five months.
My job is due to start on October the 2nd. and I’m available from
May (Q5)
the 1st until late September.
BOB: Good. Now is there anything I need to know about the food you eat?
We usually have one or two people in the group who don’t eat meat, or have some sort of food
allergy
, so we’re always very careful about that.
MARGARET: Yes, I’m
allergic
to
cheese (Q6)
. Would that be a problem?
BOB: No, as long as we have enough notice, we can deal with that.
MARGARET: That’s great.
MARGARET: It sounds really interesting — would you like me to fill in an application form?
BOB: Yes, please. Where should I post it to?
MARGARET: Could you send it to 27
Arbuthnot (Q7)
Place — A-R-B-U-T-H-N-O-T — Place. Dumfries.
BOB: And what’s the postcode, please?
MARGARET:
DG74PH (Q8)

BOB: Was that P Papa or B Bravo?
MARGARET: p papa.
BOB: Got that. If you could return the application form by Friday this week, we can interview you on
Tuesday (Q9)
next week.
Say half past two. Would that be possible for you?
MARGARET: Yes, it’s fine. You’re quite a long way from where I live, so I’ll drive over on Monday.
Should I bring anything to the interview?
BOB: We’ll have your application form, of course, but we’ll need to see any certificates you’ve got that are relevant, in cycling, first aid, or whatever.
MARGARET: OK.
BOB: And at the interview we’d like to find out about your experience of being a tour guide.
So could you prepare a ten-minute

about that please?
You don’t need slides or any complicated equipment — just some notes.
MARGARET: Right. I’ll start thinking about that straightaway!
BOB: Good. Well, we’ll look forward to receiving your application form, and we’ll contact you to confirm the interview.

剑桥雅思18 Test4 Part4
雅思听力
原文
The person I’ve chosen to talk about is the French writer Victor Hugo – many people have heard of him because his novel, Les Miserables, which he wrote in 1862, is famous around the world. It became a stage musical in the 1980s, and a film version was also released in 2012. So, some of us, I’m sure, have a pretty general idea of the
plot (Q31)
, but we know much less about the author. Today, I’m going to provide a little more insight into this talented man and I’m going to talk particularly about the home he had on the island of Guemsey in the British Channel islands.
But first, his early career … as I’ve said, he was a writer, he was at the height of his career in Paris and he was very highly regarded by his colleagues. As far as literature was concerned, he was the leading figure of the Romantic movement. However, as well as being a literary genius, he also gave many speeches about issues like the level of
poverty (Q32)
in his society. He felt very strongly about this and about other areas where change was needed, like education. This kind of outspoken criticism was not well-liked by the rulers of France and, eventually, the emperor – Napoleon III – told Victor Hugo to leave Paris and not return; in other words, he sent him into exile.
So Victor Hugo was forced to reside in other parts of
Europe (Q33)
. Guernsey was actually his third place of exile and he landed there in 1855. He produced a lot while on Guernsey – including Les Miserables – and to do this, he had to spend a great deal of time in the home that he had there. This was a property that he bought using the money he’d made in France from the publication of a collection of his
poetry (Q34)
. It was the only property he ever owned, and he was very proud of it.
The property Victor Hugo bought on Guernsey was a large, five-storey house in the capital town of St Peter Port and he lived there for 15 years, returning to France in 1870 when Napoleon’s Empire collapsed. He decorated and furnished each level, or floor, of the house in unique and wonderful ways, and many people consider the inside of the house to be a ‘work of art’. Today it’s a museum that attracts 200,000 visitors a year.
He lived in the house with his family .. and portraits of its members still hang in rooms on the ground floor, along with
drawings (Q35)
that he did during his travels that he felt were important to him. In other ground-floor rooms, there are huge tapestries that he would have designed and loved. The walls are covered in dark wood paneling that Victor Hugo created himself using wooden
furniture (Q36)
that he bought in the market. The items were relatively inexpensive, and he used them to create intricate carvings. They gave an atmosphere on the lower level that was shadowy and rather solemn.
On the next level of the house there are two impressive lounges, where he entertained his guests. One lounge has entirely red furnishings, such as sofas and wall coverings, and the other blue. There’s a strong Chinese influence in these areas in things like the wallpaper pattern and the
lamps (Q37)
– which he would have made himself by copying original versions.
His library, where he left many of his favourite books, forms the hallway to the third floor and was a comfortable area where he could relax and enjoy his afternoons. And then, at the very top of the house, there’s a room called the Lookout – called that because it looks out over the
harbor (Q38)
. In contrast to the rather dark lower levels, it’s full of light and was like a glass office where he would write until lunchtime – often at his desk.
So, Victor Hugo was a man of many talents, but he was also true to his values. While living in his house on Guernsey, he entertained many other famous writers, but he also invited a large group of local
children (Q39)
from the deprived areas of the island to dinner once a week. What’s more, he served them their food, which was an extraordinary gesture for the time period.
In 1927, the house was owned by his
relatives (Q40)
, and they decided to donate it to the city of Paris. It has since been restored using photographs from the period and, as I mentioned earlier, is now a museum that is open to the public.

原文
Nowadays, we use different products for personal cleanliness, laundry, dishwashing and household cleaning, but this is very much a 20th-century development.
The origins of cleanliness date back to prehistoric times. Since water is essential for life, the earliest people lived near water and knew something about its cleansing properties – at least that it rinsed
mud (Q31)
off their hands.
During the excavation of ancient Babylon, evidence was found that soapmaking was known as early as 2800 BC. Archaeologists discovered cylinders made of
clay (Q32)
, with inscriptions on them saying that fats were boiled with ashes. This is a method of making soap, though there’s no reference to the purpose of this material
The early Greeks bathed for aesthetic reasons and apparently didn’t use soap. Instead, they cleaned their bodies with blocks of sand, pumice and ashes, then anointed themselves with oil, and scraped off the oil and dirt with a
metal (Q33)
instrument known as a strigil. They also used oil mixed with ashes. Clothes were washed without soap in streams.
The ancient Germans and Gauls are also credited with discovering how to make a substance called ‘soap’, made of melted animal fat and ashes. They used this mixture to tint their
hair (Q34)
red.
Soap got its name, according to an ancient Roman legend, from Mount Sapo, where animals were sacrificed, leaving deposits of animal fat. Rain washed these deposits, along with wood ashes, down into the clay soil along the River Tiber. Women found that this mixture greatly reduced the effort required to wash their clothes.
As Roman civilisation advanced, so did bathing. The first of the famous Roman
baths (Q35)
, supplied with water from their aqueducts, was built around 312 BC. The baths were luxurious, and bathing became very popular. And by the second century AD, the Greek physician Galen recommended soap for both medicinal and cleansing purposes.
After the fall of Rome in 467 AD and the resulting decline in bathing habits, much of Europe felt the impact of filth on public health. This lack of personal cleanliness and related unsanitary living conditions were major factors in the outbreaks of
disease (Q36)
in the Middle Ages,and especially the Black Death of the 14th century.
Nevertheless, soapmaking became an established craft in Europe, and associations of soapmakers guarded their trade secrets closely. Vegetable and animal oils were used with ashes of plants, along with
perfume (Q37)
, apparently for the first time. Gradually more varieties of soap became available for shaving and shampooing, as well as bathing and laundering.
A major step toward large-scale commercial soapmaking occurred in 1791, when a French chemist, Nicholas Leblanc, patented a process for turning
salt (Q38)
into soda ash, or sodium carbonate. Soda ash is the alkali obtained from ashes that combines with fat to form soap. The Leblanc process yielded quantities of good-quality, inexpensive soda ash.
Modern soapmaking was born some 20 years later, in the early 19th century, with the discovery by Michel Eugène Chevreul, another French chemist, of the chemical nature and relationship of fats, glycerine and fatty acids. His studies established the basis for both fat and soap chemistry, and soapmaking became a
science (Q39)
. Further developments during the 19th century made it easier and cheaper to manufacture soap.
Until the 19th century, soap was regarded as a luxury item, and was heavily taxed in several countries. As it became more readily available, it became an everyday necessity, a development that was reinforced when the high
tax (Q40)
was removed. Soap was then something ordinary people could afford, and cleanliness standards improved.
With this widespread use came the development of milder soaps for bathing and soaps for use in the washing machines that were available to consumers by the turn of the 20th century.

该部分的易错点主要是25题和29题。其中25

原文
ANNIE: Oh Ben – I just remembered I never filled in that form for Nick – did you do it?
BEN: The course feedback form?
ANNIE: Yes. If you want, we can do it together, I’ve got mine here.
BEN: Is that OK?
ANNIE: Yeah.
BEN: OK, let’s have a look then. What do we have to do?
ANNIE: Let’s fill in the top first, let’s see, Course, Course code…
BEN: Er, it’s Communication in Business.
ANNIE: OK, Communication… in… Business, I do know that, but what’s the code?
BEN: CB 16 something, CB 162, isn’t it?
ANNIE: Mmm, that’s it, OK and dates, when did we start? I remember, my birthday’s on May 4th and it was the day after, it must have been
May 5th
.
Q21
BEN: Gosh, doesn’t seem that long ago, does it?
ANNIE: No, and we finish at the end of this week, on Friday, so that’s
July
15th?
BEN: Er
16th
, Monday was the 12th. Right, that was the easy bit, now let’s have a look – “Please give your comments on the following aspects of the course”, OK, what’s the first one? Oh, course organisation. What do you think?
Q22
ANNIE: Er, clear? It was, wasn’t it?
BEN: Yes, I think the organisation was
clear
. OK, anything else for course organisation?
Q23
ANNIE: It was a good thing he gave us
the course outline
at the beginning, in the first session, that was useful, so I’ll put that down, shall I? Now, going on to suggestion for improvement, one thing that wasn’t so good, I think we could have done a bit more work at the beginning, I mean at the beginning it seemed dead easy.
Q24
BEN: Yeah.
ANNIE: I thought it was going to be really easy and then all of a sudden in the
second half
of the course we got a whole load of work, reading to do and essays and things.
Q25
BEN: Yes, it’d be better if it was more even. OK, now course delivery, does that mean teaching?
ANNIE: Yeah, I suppose so. Well, what I thought was really good on this course was the
standard of teaching
. Actually – I mean some of the teachers were better than others – but the standard generally was fine. Much better than other courses I’ve been on.
Q26
BEN: Yeah, I agree. Let’s put that then. What about suggestions for improvement?
ANNIE: I… I didn’t think it was all that wonderful when we had great long
group discussion
sessions that went on for hours and hours. I don’t mean we shouldn’t have group discussions, just that they shouldn’t go on too long.
Q27
ANNIE: Now, on to materials and equipment.
BEN: Oh, now what was good about some sessions was the
handouts
.
Q28
ANNIE: Yes, I thought all the handouts were good actually, and some were great, with website addresses and everything.
BEN: One problem though with materials was the key texts.
ANNIE: Yes! There just weren’t enough copies on reserve in the library. And if you can’t get the key texts before the session, how are you supposed to do the reading? And not enough computers. You have to wait ages to get one.
BEN: OK, testing and evaluation – well, I don’t know, it’s hard to say until we’ve got our written assignments back.
ANNIE: Don’t talk about it, I only got mine in yesterday, it was a real struggle. I hate to think what mark I’ll get.
BEN: Yes, but at least we’ve done the oral presentation – I thought that was good, the way I got my feedback really quickly.
ANNIE: Yes, it was. And I liked the way we knew what we’d be evaluated on, we knew the criteria, so we knew we had to think about clarity, organisation, and so on.
BEN: Yeah, but I’m not so sure about the
written work
. One thing I think is that there’s just too much, it’s really stressful.
Q29
ANNIE: Yes, I’d agree and I don’t see why they can’t let us know the criteria they use for marking.
BEN: The written assignments? But he told us.
ANNIE: No, for the final exams. What are they looking for – what are the criteria? What makes a pass or a fail?
BEN: Yeah, I never thought of that. It’d be really useful.
ANNIE: OK, any other comments?
BEN: I thought
student support
was excellent.
Q30
ANNIE: Yeah, me too. OK, excellent. Other comments?
BEN: No, I can’t think of anything else.
ANNIE: Nor me. OK, so that’s done. Thanks, Ben.
BEN: No, thank you.

MAN:
Hello. Do you mind if I ask you some questions about your journey today? We’re doing a customer satisfaction survey.
SOPHIE:
Yes. OK. I’ve got about ten minutes before my train home leaves. I’m on a day trip.
MAN:
Great.Thank you. So first of all, could you tell me your name?
SOPHIE:
It’s Sophie Bird.
MAN:
Thank you. And would you mind telling me what you do?
SOPHIE:
I’m a
journalist (Q1)
.
MAN:
Oh really? That must be interesting.
SOPHIE:
Yes. It is.
MAN:
So was the reason for your visit here today work?
SOPHIE:
Actually, it’s my day off. I came here to do some
shopping (Q2)
.
MAN:
Oh right.
SOPHIE:
But I do sometimes come here for work.
MAN:
OK. Now I’d like to ask some questions about your journey today, if that’s OK.
SOPHIE:
Yes.No problem.
MAN:
Right, so can you tell me which station you’re travelling back to?
SOPHIE:
Staunfirth (Q3)
, where I live.
MAN:
Can I just check the spelling? S-T-A-U-N-F-I-R-T-H?
SOPHIE:
That’s right.
MAN:
And you travelled from there this morning?
SOPHIE:
Yes.
MAN:
OK, good. Next, can l ask what kind of ticket you bought? I assume it wasn’t a season ticket, as you don’t travel every day.
SOPHIE:
That’s right. No, I just got a normal
return (Q4)
ticket. I don’t have a rail card so I didn’t get any discount. I keep meaning to get one because it’s a lot cheaper.
MAN:
Yes – you’d have saved 20% on your ticket today. So you paid the full price for your ticket?
SOPHIE:
I paid
£23.70 (Q5)
.
MAN:
OK. Do you think that’s good value for money?
SOPHIE:
Not really. I think it’s too much for a journey that only takes 45 minutes.
MAN:
Yes, that’s one of the main complaints we get. So, you didn’t buy your ticket in advance?
SOPHIE:
No. I know it’s cheaper if you buy a week in advance but I didn’t know I was coming then.
MAN:
I know. You can’t always plan ahead. So, did you buy it this morning?
SOPHIE:
No, it was yesterday.
MAN:
Right. And do you usually buy your tickets at the station?
SOPHIE:
Well, I do usually but the ticket office closes early and I hate using ticket machines. I think ticket offices should be open for longer hours, There’s always a queue for the machines and they’re often out of order.
MAN:
A lot of customers are saying the same thing.
SOPHIE:
So to answer your question…l got an e-ticket
online (Q6)
.
MAN:
OK. Thank you. Now I’d like to ask you about your satisfaction with your journey. So what would you say you were most satisfied with today?
SOPHIE:
Well, I like the wifi on the train. It’s improved a lot. It makes it easier for me to work if I want to.
MAN:
That’s the first time today anyone’s mentioned that. It’s good to get some positive feedback on that.
SOPHIE:
Mmm
MAN:
And, is there anything you weren’t satisfied with?
SOPHIE:
Well, normally, the trains run on time and are pretty reliable but today there was a
delay (Q7)
; the train was about 15 minutes behind schedule.
MAN:
OK. I’ll put that down. Now I’d also like to ask about the facilities at this station. You’ve probably noticed that the whole station’s been upgraded. What are you most satisfied with?
SOPHIE:
I think the best thing is that they’ve improved the amount of
information (Q8)
about train times etc. that’s given to passengers -it’s much clearer-before there was only one board and I couldn’t always see it properly-which was frustrating.
MAN:
That’s good. And is there anything you’re not satisfied with?
SOPHIE:
Let’s see… I think things have generally improved a lot. The trains are much more modern and I like the new café. But one thing is that there aren’t enough places to sit down, especially on the
platforms (Q9)
.
MAN:
OK – so I’ll put ‘seating’ down, shall I, as the thing you’re least satisfied with?
SOPHIE:
Yes. OK
MAN:
Can I ask your opinion about some of the other facilities? We’d like feedback on whether people are satisfied, dissatisfied or neither satisfied nor dissatisfied.
SOPHIE:
ОK.
MAN:
What about the
parking (Q10)
at the station?
SOPHIE:
Well to be honest, I don’t really have an opinion as I never use it.
MAN:
So, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied for that then.
SOPHIE:
Yes, I suppose so…
MAN:
OK, and what about…?

RUTH:
Ed, how are you getting on with the reading for our presentation next week?
ED:
Well, OK, Ruth-but there’s so much of it.
RUTH:
I know, I hadn’t realised birth order was such a popular area of research.
ED:
But the stuff on birth order and personality is mostly unreliable. From what I’ve been reading a lot of the claims about how your position in the family determines certain personality traits are just stereotypes, with no robust evidence to support them.
RUTH:
OK, but that’s an interesting point – we could start by outlining what previous research has shown. There are studies going back over a hundred years.
ED:
Yeah-so we could just run through some of the typical traits. Like the consensus seems to be that oldest children are generally less well-adjusted because they never get over the arrival of a younger sibling.
RUTH:
Right, but on a positive note, some studies claimed that
they were thought to be good at nurturing-certainly in the past when people had large families they would have been expected to look after the younger ones (Q21)
.
ED:
There isn’t such a clear picture for middle children – but one trait that a lot of the studies mention is that they are easier to get on with than older or younger siblings.
RUTH:
Generally eager to please and helpful (Q22)
– although that’s certainly not accurate as far as my family goes – my middle brother was a nightmare-always causing fights and envious of whatever I had.
ED:
As I said – none of this seems to relate to my own experience. I’m the youngest in my family and I don’t recognise myself in any of the studies I’ve read about. I’m supposed to have been
a sociable and confident child who made friends easily (Q23)
– but I was actually terribly shy.
RUTH:
Really? That’s funny. There have been hundreds of studies on twins but mostly about nurture versus nature…
ED:
There was one on personality, which said that a twin is likely to be
quite shy in social situations (Q24)
because they always have their twin around to depend on for support.
RUTH:
My cousins were like that when they were small-they were only interested in each other and found it hard to engage with other kids.
ED:
They’re fine now though. Only children have had a really bad press – a lot of studies have branded them as
loners who think the world revolves around them (Q25)
because they’ve never had to fight for their parents’ attention.
RUTH:
That does seem a bit harsh. One category I hadn’t considered before was children with much older siblings – a couple of studies mentioned that these children
grow up more quickly and are expected to do basic things for themselves-like getting dressed (Q26)
.
ED:
I can see how that might be true – although I expect they’re sometimes the exact opposite-playing the baby role and clamouring for special treatment.
RUTH:
What was the problem with most of these studies, do you think?
ED:
I think it was because in a lot of cases data was collected from only one sibling per family, who rated him or herself and his or her siblings at the same time.
RUTH:
Mmm. Some of the old research into the relationship between birth order and academic achievement has been proved to be accurate though. Performances in intelligence tests decline slightly from the eldest child to his or her younger siblings. This has been proved in lots of recent studies.
ED:
Yes.
Although what many of them didn’t take into consideration was family size (Q27)
. The more siblings there are, the likelier the family is to have a low socio-economic status -which can also account for differences between siblings in academic performance.
RUTH:
The oldest boy might be given more opportunities than his younger sisters, for example.
ED:
Exactly.
RUTH:
But the main reason for the marginally higher academic performance of oldest children is quite surprising, I think. It’s not only that they benefit intellectually from extra attention at a young age – which is what I would have expected.
It’s that they benefit from being teachers for their younger siblings, by verbalising processes (Q28)
.
ED:
Right, and this gives them status and confidence, which again contribute, in a small way, to better performance. So would you say sibling rivalry has been a useful thing for you?
RUTH:
I think so-my younger brother was incredibly annoying and we fought a lot but l think this has made me a stronger person.
I know how to defend myself (Q29)
. We had some terrible arguments and I would have died rather than apologise to him-but
we had to put up with each other (Q30)
and most of the time we co-existed amicably enough.
ED:
Yes, my situation was pretty similar. But I don’t think having two older brothers made me any less selfish -I was never prepared to let my brothers use any of my stuff…
RUTH:
That’s perfectly normal, whereas…

雅思听力
原文
SARAH:
Hello.Children’s Engineering Workshops.
FATHER:
Oh hello. I wanted some information about the workshops in the school holidays.
SARAH:
Sure.
FATHER:
I have two daughters who are interested. The younger one’s Lydia, she’s four – do you take children as young as that?
SARAH:
Yes, our Tiny Engineers workshop is for four to five-year-olds.
FATHER:
What sorts of activities do they do?
SARAH:
All sorts. For example, they work together to design a special cover that goes round an
egg (Q1)
, so that when it’s inside they can drop it from a height and it doesn’t break. Well, sometimes it does break but that’s part of the fun!
FATHER:
Right. And Lydia loves building things. Is there any opportunity for her to do that?
SARAH:
Well, they have a competition to see who can make the highest
tower (Q2)
. You’d be amazed how high they can go.
FATHER:
Right.
SARAH:
But they’re learning all the time as well as having fun. For example, one thing they do is to design and build a
car (Q3)
that’s attached to a balloon, and the force of the air in that actually powers the car and makes it move along. They go really fast too.
FATHER:
OK, well, all this sounds perfect.
FATHER:
Now Carly, that’s my older daughter, has just had her seventh birthday, so presumably she’d be in a different group?
SARAH:
Yes, she’d be in the Junior Engineers. That’s for children from six to eight.
FATHER:
And do they do the same sorts of activities?
SARAH:
Some are the same, but a bit more advanced. So they work out how to build model vehicles, things like cars and trucks, but also how to construct
animals (Q4)
using the same sorts of material and technique, and then they learn how they can program them and make them move.
FATHER:
So they learn a bit of coding?
SARAH:
They do. They pick it up really quickly. We’re there to help if they need it, but they learn from one another too.
FATHER:
Right. And do they have competitions too?
SARAH:
Yes, with the Junior Engineers, it’s to use recycled materials like card and wood to build a
bridge (Q5)
, and the longest one gets a prize.
FATHER:
That sounds fun. I wouldn’t mind doing that myself!
SARAH:
Then they have something a bit different, this is which is to think up an idea for a five-minute
movie (Q6)
and then film it, using special animation software. You’d be amazed what they come up with.
FATHER:
And of course, that’s something they can put on their phone and take home to show all their friends.
SARAH:
Exactly. And then they also build a robot in the shape of a human, and they
decorate (Q7)
it and program it so that it can move its arms and legs.
FATHER:
Perfect. So, is it the same price as the Tiny Engineers?
SARAH:
It’s just a bit more: £50 for the five weeks
FATHER:
And are the classes on a Monday, too?
SARAH:
They used to be, but we found it didn’t give our staff enough time to clear up after the first workshop, so we moved them to
Wednesdays (Q8)
. The classes are held in the morning from ten to eleven.
FATHER:
OK. That’s better for me actually. And what about the location? Where exactly are the workshops held?
SARAH:
They’re in building 10A – there’s a big sign on the door, you can’t miss it, and that’s in
Fradstone (Q9)
Industrial Estate.
FATHER:
Sorry?
SARAH:
Fradstone – that’s F-R-A-D-S-T-O-N-E
FATHER:
And that’s in Grasford, isn’t it?
SARAH:
Yes, up past the station.
FATHER:

剑桥雅思5 test 4 Section 4听力原文与答案
这篇雅思听力Section 4由比较反人类的
选择题和匹配题
构成。通常来说，相比于前面几部分的选择和匹配，Section 4会在同义替换上下更大的功夫，尤其喜欢词义解释和句子替换这种需要完全理解文章内容才能够作对的出题方式。所以如果大家在考场上遇到这种出题组合，基本就可以考虑报名下一场了。不过，好消息是选择题和匹配题在Section 4一直都比较少见。去年50场雅思考试中只有4场出现了这两种题型，而且还只是作为填空题的补充，所以也不必太过担心。
场景方面，这篇文章介绍了某个图书馆的各项设施和服务，属于雅思听力比较喜欢考察的内容。大家做完之后可以总结下相关词汇，以防下次在考试中遇到。

原文
OK, are you all settled? Well, first of all, welcome to Cardiff University. I’m here to explain what we can offer you.
Now, as a new student at the university, you will probably need some sort of guidance to help you to use the library effectively to study and research. Some of you have asked about a guided tour but we find this rather muddles people. So,
in this first week, we run a series of talks which focus on different aspects of the library and its resources
. You’ll also find that to get the most out of the library you really do need to be computer literate and so all this term we run small classes which will bring you up to speed on how to access the computer-loaded information.
Q31
OK, now let me give you an outline of what’s available to you. You’ll find that the computers are increasingly used as a research tool. Many students do most of their research on the internet and the library computers are permanently online. Having found what you need, you’ll find you can readily save texts on your personal computer space to print off when you need. You might think that it is the fastest way to get information but the links can be slow.
Clearly you can find lots on there but much of it is useless information as it is from highly debatable sources
– so be critical. You’ll also find that the library has loaded several CD-ROMS onto the computers from specialist reference sources such as the MLA. It means we can expand what we offer you
at very little extra cost
and saves us having to invest in more and more books. The CD-ROMS contain exactly the same information as the reference books as the two are updated together.
Q32, Q33
Now most of you will need to refer to journal articles in your work and you’ll find you can also access these online and we encourage you to do so.
Clearly some of you will find the printed version more accessible as it sits on the shelves but I’m afraid the intention is to phase these out eventually
. However, you will still be able to print off a version of the text rather than photocopying the journal pages. So you must get used to working online. Naturally we do still have the full range of classic reference books, additional to the CD-ROMS, for you to use and there are several copies of each one. This is because
some of you may prefer to borrow a book rather than sit in the library
. There is a restricted loan time on these so that they are not missing from the shelves for too long. Although there is a Section Manager for each part of the library, they are very busy and so, if you do get stuck looking for things, you should ask the relevant Cataloguing Assistant. As your Training Supervisor,
I just oversee your induction
and will not be around after this initial week.
Q34, Q35, Q36
Some of you may be interested to know that the library is offering specialised training sessions on writing a dissertation. Obviously this is not relevant to those of you who are undergraduates; it is just for postgraduates. Your department will discuss the planning stage of the dissertation – i.e. what you’re going to do – with you and we will focus on the structure of it. However,
the training will also include some time on the computers
. I realise most of you know how to organise files but we can show you the
different ways to run data programmes
. Your tutors will tell you at the outset how to set out the chapters they require but you will need to
ask them how they would like you to organise the bibliography
because it varies depending on your subject area.
When you’ve got something together the trainer here will look through the draft version for you to see if it’s OK
. And, one final point, for those of you who have registered from abroad, we can offer individual sessions on dissertations if you feel you need them.
If you require language lessons then they are available from the International Centre next to the Law Department
.

原文
DIRECTOR
: Good morning.
Welcome to the Early Learning Childcare Centre.
How may I help you?
CAROL
: Hi.
I spoke to you last week about enrolling my daughter for next year.
DIRECTOR
: Oh, yes.
I’ll just get some details from you.
So, you’re her mother?
CAROL
: That’s right.
DIRECTOR
: And, can I have your name?
CAROL
: It’s Carol, Carol Smith.
DIRECTOR
: And your daughter’s name?
CAROL
: It’s Kate.
DIRECTOR
: Now, we have several groups at the centre and we
cater
for children from three to five years old.
How old is your daughter?
CAROL
: She’s three now but she turns four next month.
DIRECTOR
: I’ll put
four (Q1)
down because that’s how old she’ll be when she starts.
CAROL
: Fine, she’s so excited about her birthday and coming to the centre.
DIRECTOR
: That’s good to hear.
And what’s your address?
CAROL
: It’s
46 Wombat Road (Q2)
, that’s W-O-M-B-A-T.
Woodside 4032.
DIRECTOR
: And what’s the phone number?
CAROL
: Oh …
it’s … 3345 9865.
DIRECTOR
: So, have you decided on the days you’d like to bring your daughter here?
CAROL
: I’d prefer Monday and Wednesday if possible.
DIRECTOR
: Mmm.
I’ll check.
Monday’s fine, but I think the centre is already full for Wednesday.
Erm.
Yes.
Sorry.
It seems to be a very popular day.
We can offer you a Thursday or a Friday as well.
CAROL
: Oh dear.
I suppose
Thursday (Q3)
would be all right because she has swimming on Friday.
DIRECTOR
: OK, got that.
Because a lot of parents work, we do offer
flexible
start and finish times.
We are open from 7:30 in the morning until 6 o’clock at night.
What time would you like your daughter to start?
CAROL
: I need to get to work in the city by 9:00 so I’ll drop her off at
8:30 (Q4)
.
You’re pretty dose to the city here so that should give me plenty of time to get there.
DIRECTOR
: That’s fine.
Now, we also need to decide which group she’ll be in.
We have two different groups and they’re divided up according to age.
There’s the green group, which is for three- to four-year-olds.
And then there’s the
red (Q5)
group which is for four- to five-year-olds.
CAROL
: She’s quite mature for her age and she can already write her name and read a little.
DIRECTOR
: Well.
I’ll put her in the red group and we can always change her to the green one if there are any problems.
CAROL
: That sounds fine.
DIRECTOR
: OK.
Let’s move on to meals.
We can provide breakfast, lunch and dinner.
As she’s finishing pretty early, she won’t need dinner, will you give her breakfast before she comes?
CAROL
: Yes, she’ll only need
lunch (Q6)
.
DIRECTOR
: Now, does she have any medical conditions we need to know about?
Does she have
asthma
or any hearing problems for example?
CAROL
: No.
But she does need to wear
glasses (Q7)
.
DIRECTOR
: Oh, I’ll make a note of that.
CAROL
: Yes, she’s pretty good about wearing them, she can’t see much without them.
DIRECTOR
: Right.
OK.
Now, I also need
emergency
contact details.
CAROL
: So what sort of information do you need?
DIRECTOR
: Just the name and number of a friend or family member we can contact in case we can’t get hold of you at any time.
CAROL
: OK.
That’d better be my sister…
Jenny Ball.
That’s
B-A-double L (Q8)
.
Her phone number is 3346 7523.
DIRECTOR
: Great.
So she is the child’s
aunt (Q9)
?
CAROL
: Yes, that’s right.
DIRECTOR
: I’ll make a note of that as well.
Now, is there anything you’d like to ask?
CAROL
: What about payment?
How much are the fees each term?
DIRECTOR
: Well, for two days and the hours you’ve chosen, that will be $450
altogether
.
CAROL
: OK, and do I have to pay that now?
DIRECTOR
: No, we send out invoices once the children start at the centre.
You can choose to pay at the end of each term or we do offer a slightly discounted rate if you pay
every month (Q10)
.
CAROL
: Oh.
I’ll do that then.
I find it easier to
budget
that way and I’m not used to the term dates just yet.
DIRECTOR
: Good, it makes it a lot simpler for us as well.
Well, that’s everything.
Would you like me to show you around…?

剑5 test 3 Section 4
雅思听力
原文
STUDENT: Well, my group has been doing a project on how household waste is recycled in Britain.
We were quite shocked to discover that only 9% of people here in the UK make an effort to recycle their household waste. This is a lower figure than in most other European countries, and needs to increase dramatically in the next few years if the government is going to meet its recycling targets.
The agreed targets for the UK mean that by 2008 we must reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by
12.5%
, compared with 1990. And recycling can help to achieve that goal, in two main ways: the production of recycled glass and paper uses much less energy than producing them from virgin materials, and also recycling reduces greenhouse gas emissions from landfill sites and
incineration plants
.
Q31/Q32
As part of our project, we carried out a survey of people in the street, and the thing that came up over and over again is that people don’t think it’s easy enough to recycle their waste. One problem is that there aren’t enough ‘
drop-off
’ sites, that is, the places where the public are supposed to take their waste.
Q33
We also discovered that waste that’s collected from householders is taken to places called ‘bring banks’, for sorting and baling into loads. One problem here is taking out everything that shouldn’t have been placed in the recycling containers: people put all sorts of things into bottle banks, like plastic bags and even broken umbrellas. All this has to be removed by hand. Another difficulty is that toughened glass used for
cooking
doesn’t fully melt at the temperature required for other glass, and so that also has to be picked out by hand.
Q34
Glass is easy to recycle because it can be reused over and over again without becoming weaker. Two million tons of glass is thrown away each year, that is, seven billion bottles and jars; but only
500,000
tons of that is collected and recycled.
Q35
Oddly enough, half the glass that’s collected is green, and a lot of that is imported, so more green glass is recycled than the UK needs. As a result, new uses are being developed for recycled glass, particularly green glass, for example in fibreglass manufacture and water filtration. A company called CLF Aggregates makes a product for
roads
, and 30% of the material is crushed glass.
Q36
For recycling paper, Britain comes second in Europe with 40%, behind Germany’s amazing 70%.
When recycling started, there were quality problems, so it was difficult to use recycled paper in office printers. But these problems have now been solved, and Martin’s, based in South London, produces a range of office stationery which is 100% recycled, costs the same as normal paper and is of equally high quality.
But this high quality comes at a cost in terms of the waste produced during the process. Over a third of the waste paper that comes in can’t be used in the recycled paper, leaving the question of what to do with it. One firm, Papersave, currently sells this to farmers as a
soil conditioner
, though this practice will soon be banned because of transport costs and the smell, and the company is looking into the possibility of alternative uses.
Q37
Plastic causes problems, because there are so many different types of plastic in use today, and each one has to be dealt with differently. Pacrite recycles all sorts of things, from bottles to car bumpers, and one of its most successful activities is recycling plastic bottles to make
containers
which are used all over the country to collect waste.
Q38
The Save-a-Cup scheme was set up by the vending and plastics industries to recycle as many as possible of the three-and-a-half billion polystyrene cups used each year. At the moment 500 million polycups are collected, processed and sold on to other businesses, such as Waterford, which turns the cups into
pencils
, and Johnson & Jones, a Welsh-based firm, which has developed a wide variety of items, including
business cards
.
Q39, Q40
Well, to sum up, there seems to be plenty of research going on into how to re-use materials, but the biggest problem is getting people to think about recycling instead of throwing things away. At least doing the research made us much more careful.

剑桥雅思13 test1 section4
雅思听力
原文
Hi. Today we’re going to be looking at animals in urban environments and I’m going to be telling you about some research on how they’re affected by these environments.
Now, in evolutionary terms, urban environments represent huge upheavals, the sorts of massive changes that usually happen over millions of years. And we used to think that only a few species could adapt to this new environment. One species which is well known as being highly adaptable is the
crow (Q31)
, and there’ve been various studies about how they manage to learn new skills. Another successful species is the pigeon, because they’re able to perch on ledges on the walls of city buildings, just like they once perched on
cliffs (Q32)
by the sea.
But in fact, we’re now finding that these early immigrants were just the start of a more general movement of animals into cities, and of adaptation by these animals to city life. And one thing that researchers are finding especially interesting is the
speed (Q33)
with which they’re doing this – we’re not talking about gradual evolution here – these animals are changing fast.
Let me tell you about some of the studies that have been carried out in this area. So, in the University of Minnesota, a biologist called Emilie Snell-Rood and her colleagues looked at specimens of urbanised small mammals such as mice and gophers that had been collected in Minnesota, and that are now kept in museums there. And she looked at specimens that had been collected over the last hundred years, which is a very short time in evolutionary terms. And she found that during that time, these small mammals had experienced a jump in
brain (Q34)
size when compared to rural mammals. Now, we can’t be sure this means they’re more intelligent, but since the sizes of other parts of the body didn’t change, it does suggest that something cognitive was going on. And Snell-Rood thinks that this change might reflect the cognitive demands of adjusting to city life – having to look in different places to find
food (Q35)
, for example, and coping with a whole new set of dangers.
Then over in Germany at the Max Planck Institute, there’s another biologist called Catarina Miranda who’s done some experiments with blackbirds living in urban and rural areas. And she’s been looking not at their anatomy but at their
behaviour (Q36)
. So as you might expect, she’s found that the urban blackbirds tend to be quite bold – they’re prepared to face up to a lot of threats that would frighten away their country counterparts. But there’s one type of situation that does seem to frighten the urban blackbirds, and that’s anything
new (Q37)
– anything they haven’t experienced before. And if you think about it, that’s quite sensible for a bird living in the city.
Jonathan Atwell, in Indiana University, is looking at how a range of animals respond to urban environments. He’s found that when they’re under
stress (Q38)
, their endocrine systems react by reducing the amount of hormones such as corticosterone into their blood. It’s a sensible- seeming adaptation. A rat that gets scared every time a subway train rolls past won’t be very successful.
There’s just one more study I’d like to mention which is by Sarah Parian and her team, and they’ve been looking at how squirrels communicate in an urban environment, and they’ve found that a routine part of their communication is carried out by waving their
tails (Q39)
. You do also see this in the country, but it’s much more prevalent in cities, possibly because it’s effective in a noisy environment.
So what are the long-term implications of this? One possibility is that we may see completely new species developing in cities. But on the other hand, it’s possible that not all of these adaptations will be
permanent (Q40)
. Once the animal’s got accustomed to its new environment, it may no longer need the features it’s developed.
So, now we’ve had a look …

剑桥雅思13Test3Section4听力答案解析 The sleepy lizard (tiliqua rugosa)
剑桥雅思13 test3 section4
雅思听力
原文
Last week, we started looking at reptiles, including crocodiles and snakes. Today, I’d like us to have a look at another reptile – the lizard – and in particular, at some studies that have been done on a particular type of lizard whose Latin name is tiliqua rugosa. This is commonly known as the sleepy lizard, because it’s quite slow in its movements and spends quite a lot of its time dozing under rocks or lying in the sun.
I’ll start with a general description. Sleepy lizards live in Western and South Australia, where they’re quite common. Unlike European lizards, which are mostly small, green and fast-moving, sleepy lizards are brown, but what’s particularly distinctive about them is the colour of their
tongue (Q31)
, which is dark blue, in contrast with the lining of their mouth which is bright pink. And they’re much bigger than most European lizards. They have quite a varied diet, including insects and even small animals, but they mostly eat
plants (Q32)
of varying kinds.
Even though they’re quite large and powerful, with strong jaws that can crush beetles and snail shells, they still have quite a few predators. Large birds like cassowaries were one of the main ones in the past, but nowadays they’re more likely to be caught and killed by
snakes (Q33)
. Actually, another threat to their survival isn’t a predator at all, but is man-made – quite a large number of sleepy lizards are killed by cars when they’re trying to cross highways.
One study carried out by Michael Freake at Flinders University investigated the methods of navigation of these lizards. Though they move slowly, they can travel quite long distances. And he found that even if they were taken some distance away from their home territory, they could usually find their way back home as long as they could see the
sky (Q34)
– they didn’t need any other landmarks on the around.
Observations of these lizards in the wild have also revealed that their mating habits are quite unusual. Unlike most animals, it seems that they’re relatively monogamous, returning to the same
partner (Q35)
year after year. And the male and female also stay together for a long time, both before and after the birth of their young.
It’s quite interesting to think about the possible reasons for this. It could be that it’s to do with protecting their young – you’d expect them to have a much better chance of survival if they have both parents around. But in fact observers have noted that once the babies have hatched out of their eggs, they have hardly any
contact (Q36)
with their parents. So, there’s not really any evidence to support that idea.
Another suggestion’s based on the observation that male lizards in monogamous relationships tend to be bigger and stronger than other males. So maybe the male lizards stay around so they can give the female lizards
protection (Q37)
from other males. But again, we’re not really sure.
Finally, I’d like to mention another study that involved collecting data by tracking the lizards. I was actually involved in this myself. So we caught some lizards in the wild and we developed a tiny GPS system that would allow us to track them, and we fixed this onto their
tails (Q38)
. Then we set the lizards free again, and we were able to track them for twelve days and gather data, not just about their location, but even about how many
steps (Q39)
they took during this period.
One surprising thing we discovered from this is that there were far fewer meetings between lizards than we expected – it seems that they were actually trying to avoid one another. So why would that be? Well, again we have no clear evidence, but one hypothesis is that male lizards can cause quite serious
injuries (Q40)
to one another, so maybe this avoidance is a way of preventing this – of self-preservation if you like. But we need to collect a lot more data before we can be sure of any of this.

Dancing is something that humans do when they want to have a good time. It’s a universal response to music, found in all cultures. But what’s only been discovered recently is that dancing not only makes us feel good, it’s also extremely good for our health.
Dancing, like other forms of exercise, releases hormones, such as dopamine, which make us feel relaxed and happy. And it also reduces feelings of stress or anxiety.
Dancing is also a sociable activity, which is another reason it makes us feel good.
One study compared people’s enjoyment of dancing at home in front of a video with dancing in a group in a studio.
The people dancing in a group reported feeling happier, whereas those dancing alone did not.
In another experiment, university researchers at York and Sheffield took a group of students and sent each of them into a lab where music was played for five minutes. Each had to choose from three options: to sit and listen quietly to the music, to cycle on an exercise bike while they listened, or to get up and dance. All were given cognitive tasks to perform before and after. The result showed that those who chose to dance showed much more
creativity (Q31)
when doing problem-solving tasks.
Doctor Lovatt at the University of Hertfordshire believes dance could be a very useful way to help people suffering from mental health problems. He thinks dance should be prescribed as
therapy (Q32)
to help people overcome issues such as depression.
It’s well established that dance is a good way of encouraging adolescent girls to take exercise but what about older people? Studies have shown that there are enormous benefits for people in their sixties and beyond. One of the great things about dance is that there are no barriers to participation. Anyone can have a go, even those whose standard of
fitness (Q33)
is quite low
Dance can be especially beneficial for older adults who can’t run or do more intense workouts, or for those who don’t want to. One 2015 study found that even a gentle dance workout helps to promote a healthy heart. And there’s plenty of evidence which suggests that dancing lowers the risk of falls, which could result in a broken hip, for example, by helping people to improve their
balance (Q34)
.
There are some less obvious benefits of dance for older people too. One thing I hadn’t realised before researching this topic was that dance isn’t just a physical challenge. It also requires a lot of concentration because you need to remember different steps and routines, For older people, this kind of activity is especially important because it forces their
brain (Q35)
to process things more quickly and to retain more information.
Current research also shows that dance promotes a general sense of well-being in older participants, which can last up to a week after a class. Participants report feeling less tired and having greater
motivation (Q36)
to be more active and do daily activities such as gardening or walking to the shops or a park.
Ballroom or country dancing, both popular with older people, have to be done in groups. They require collaboration and often involve touching a dance partner, all of which encourages interaction on the dance floor. This helps to develop new relationships and can reduce older people’s sense of
isolation (Q37)
, which is a huge problem in many countries
I also looked at the benefits of Zumba. Fifteen million people in 180 countries now regularly take a Zumba class, an aerobic workout based on Latin American dance moves. John Porcari, a professor of exercise and sport science at the University of Wisconsin, analysed a group of women who were Zumba regulars and found that a class lasting 40 minutes burns about 370
calories (Q38)
. This is similar to moderately intense exercises like step aerobics o kickboxing
A study in the
American Journal of Health Behavior
showed that when women with
obesity (Q39)
did Zumba three times a week for 16 weeks, they lost an average of 1.2 kilos and lowered their percentage of body fat by 1%. More importantly, the women enjoyed the class so much that they made it a
habit (Q40)
and continued to attend classes at least once a week – very unusual for an aerobic exercise programme.
Dance is never going to compete with high-intensity workouts when it comes to physical fitness gains, but its popularity is likely to keep on rising because it’s such a fun way to keep fit.

MAN:
Excuse me. Would you mind if I asked you some questions? We’re doing a survey on transport.
SADIE:
Yes, that’s OK.
MAN:
First of all, can I take your name?
SADIE:
Yes. It’s Sadie Jones.
MAN:
Thanks very much. And could I have your date of birth – just the year will do, actually.  Is that all right?
SADIE:
Yes, that’s fine. It’s 1991.
MAN:
So next your postcode, please.
SADIE:
It’s
DW30 7YZ (Q1)
MAN:
Great. Thanks. Is that in Wells?
SADIE:
No it’s actually in Harborne -Wells isn’t far from there, though.
MAN:
I really like that area. My grandmother lived there when I was a kid.
SADIE:
Yes, it is nice.
MAN:
Right, so now I want to ask you some questions about how you travelled here today. Did you use public transport?
SADIE:
Yes. I came by bus.
MAN:
OK. And that was today. It’s the
24th of April (Q2)
, isn’t it?
SADIE:
SADIE: Isn’t it the 25th? No, actually, you’re right.
MAN:
Ha ha. And what was the reason for your trip today? I can see you’ve got some shopping with you.
SADIE:
Yes. I did some shopping but the main reason I came here was to go to the
dentist (Q3)
.
MAN:
That’s not much fun. Hope it was nothing serious.
SADIE:
No, it was just a check-up. It’s fine.
MAN:
Good. Do you normally travel by bus into the city centre?
SADIE:
Yes. I stopped driving in ages ago because
parking (Q4)
was so difficult to find and it costs so much.
MAN:
I see.
SADIE:
The bus is much more convenient too. This is from laokaoya website. It only takes about 30 minutes.
MAN:
That’s good. So where did you start your journey?
SADIE:
At the bus stop on
Claxby (Q5)
Street.
MAN:
Is that C-L-A-X-B-Y?
SADIE:
That’s right.
MAN:
And how satisfied with the service are you? Do you have any complaints?
SADIE:
Well, as I said, it’s very convenient and quick when it’s on time, but this morning it was
late (Q6)
. Only about 10 minutes, but still.
MAN:
Yes, I understand that’s annoying. And what about the timetable? Do you have any comments about that?
SADIE:
Mmm. I suppose I mainly use the bus during the day, but any time I’ve been in town in the
evening (Q7)
– for dinner or at the cinema – I’ve noticed you have to wait a long time for a bus – there aren’t that many.
MAN:
OK, thanks. So now I’d like to ask you about your car use.
SADIE:
Well, I have got a car but I don’t use it that often. Mainly just to go to the
supermarket (Q8)
. But that’s about it really. My husband uses it at the weekends to go to the golf club.
MAN:
And what about a bicycle?
SADIE:
I don’t actually have one at the moment.
MAN:
What about the city bikes you can rent? Do you ever use those?
SADIE:
No – I’m not keen on cycling there because of all the
pollution (Q9)
. But I would like to get a bike – it would be good to use it to get to work.
MAN:
So why haven’t you got one now?
SADIE:
Well, I live in a flat – on the second floor and it doesn’t have any
storage (Q10)
– so we’d have to leave it in the hall outside the flat.
MAN:
I see. OK. Well, I think that’s all …
