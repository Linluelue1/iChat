原文
ROB:
Good morning.
Stretton Festival box office.
How can I help you?
MELANIE:
Oh, hello.
My family and I are on holiday in the area, and we’ve seen some posters about the festival this week.
Could you tell me about some of the events, please?
ROB:
Of course.
MELANIE:
First of all, are there still tickets available for the jazz band on Saturday?
ROB:
There are, but only (Example) ￡15.
The ￡12 seats have all been sold.
MELANIE:
OK.
And the venue is the school, isn’t it?
ROB:
Yes, that’s right, the
secondary
(Q1)
school
.
Make sure you don’t go to the primary school by mistake!
And there’s an additional
performer
who isn’t mentioned on the posters – Carolyn Hart is going to play with the band.
MELANIE:
Oh, I think I’ve heard her on the radio.
Doesn’t she play the oboe, or flute or something?
ROB:
Yes the
flute (Q2)
.
She usually plays with
symphony
orchestras, and apparently this is her first time with a jazz band.
MELANIE:
Well, I’d certainly like to hear her.
Then the next thing I want to ask about is the duck races – I saw a poster beside a river.
What are they, exactly?
ROB:
Well, you buy a yellow
plastic
duck – or as many as you like – they’re a pound each.
And you write your name on each one.
There’ll be several races, depending on the number of ducks taking part.
And John Stevens, a
champion
swimmer who lives locally, is going to start the races.
All the ducks will be launched into the river at the back of the
cinema (Q3)
, then they’ll
float
along the river for 500 metres, as far as the railway bridge.
MELANIE:
And are there any prizes?
ROB:
Yes, the first duck in each race to arrive at the finishing line wins its owner
free tickets
for the
concert (Q4)
on the last night of the festival.
MELANIE:
You said you can buy a duck?
I’m sure my children will both want one.
ROB:
They’re on sale at a stall in the
market
(Q5)
.
You can’t miss it – it’s got an enormous sign showing a couple of ducks.
MELANIE:
OK.
I’ll go there this afternoon.
I remember walking past there yesterday.
Now could you tell me something about the flower show, please?
ROB:
Well, admission is free, and the show is being held in Bythwaite Hall.
MELANIE:
Sorry, how do you spell that?
ROB:
B-Y-T-H-W-A-I-T-E.
Bythwaite
(Q6)
.
MELANIE:
Is it easy to find?
I’m not very familiar with the town yet.
ROB:
Oh, you won’t have any problem.
It’s right in the centre of Stretton.
It’s the only old building in the town, so it’s easy to recognise.
MELANIE:
I know it.
I presume it’s open all day.
ROB:
Yes, but if you’d like to see the prizes being awarded for the best flowers, you’ll need to be there at 5 o’clock.
The prizes are being given by a famous
actor
(Q7)
, Kevin Shapless.
He lives nearby and gets involved in a lot of community events.
MELANIE:
Gosh
, I’ve seen him on TV.
I’ll definitely go to the prize-giving.
ROB:
Right.
MELANIE:
I’ve seen a list of plays that are being performed this week, and I’d like to know which are suitable for my children, and which ones my husband and I might go to.
ROB:
How old are your children?
MELANIE:
Five and seven.
What about ‘The Mystery of Muldoon’?
ROB:
That’s aimed at five to ten-year-olds
(Q8)
.
MELANIE:
So if I take my children, I can expect them to enjoy it more than I do?
ROB:
I think so.
If you’d like something for yourself and your husband, and leave your children with a babysitter, you might like to see ‘Fire and Flood’
(Q9)
– it’s about events that really happened in Stretton two hundred years ago, and children might find it rather frightening.
MELANIE:
Oh, thanks for the warning.
And finally, what about ‘Silly Sailor’?
ROB:
That’s a comedy, and it’s for
young and old
(Q10)
.
In fact, it won an award in the Stretton Drama Festival a couple of months ago.
MELANIE:
OK.
Well, goodbye, and thanks for all the information.
I’m looking forward to the festival!
ROB:
Goodbye.
