原文
As we saw in the last lecture, a major cause of climate change is the rapid rise in the level of
carbon
dioxide
in the atmosphere over the last century.
If we could reduce the amount of CO2, perhaps the rate of climate change could also be slowed down.
One
potential
method involves enhancing the role of the soil that plants grow in, with regard to absorbing CO2.
Rattan Lal, a soil scientist from Ohio State University, in the USA, claims that the world’s agricultural soils could potentially absorb 13 per cent of the
carbon
dioxide
in the atmosphere – the
equivalent
of the amount released in the last 30 years.
And research is going on into how this might be achieved.
Lal first came to the idea that soil might be valuable in this way not through an interest in climate change, but rather out of concern for the land itself and the people dependent on it.
Carbon-rich soil is dark,
crumbly
and
fertile
, and retains some water.
But
erosion
can occur if soil is
dry (Q31)
, which is a likely effect if it contains inadequate amounts of
carbon
.
Erosion
is of course bad for people trying to grow crops or breed animals on that
terrain
.
In the 1970s and’80s, Lal was studying soils in Africa so devoid of organic matter that the ground had become extremely
hard (Q32)
, like
cement
.
There he met a
pioneer
in the study of global warming, who suggested that
carbon
from the soil had moved into the atmosphere.
This is now looking increasingly likely.
Let me explain.
For millions of years,
carbon
dioxide
levels in the atmosphere have been regulated, in part, by a natural partnership between plants and microbes – tiny organisms in the soil.
Plants absorb CO2 from the air and transform it into
sugars (Q33)
and other carbon-based substances.
While a
proportion
of these
carbon
products remain in the plant, some transfer from the
roots (Q34)
to
fungi
and soil microbes, which store the
carbon
in the soil.
The invention of
agriculture
some 10,000 years ago disrupted these ancient soil-building processes and led to the loss of
carbon
from the soil.
When humans started draining the natural
topsoil
, and ploughing it up for planting, they
exposed
the buried
carbon
to oxygen.
This created
carbon
dioxide
and released it into the air.
And in some places, grazing by
domesticated
animals has removed all
vegetation
, releasing
carbon
into the air.
Tons of
carbon
have been stripped from the world’s soils – where it’s needed – and pumped into the atmosphere.
So what can be done?
Researchers are now coming up with evidence that even modest changes to farming can significantly help to reduce the amount of
carbon
in the atmosphere.
Some growers have already started using an approach known as regenerative
agriculture
.
This aims to boost the
fertility
of soil and keep it
moist
(Q35)
through established practices.
These include keeping fields planted all year round, and increasing the
variety (Q36)
of plants being grown.
Strategies like these can significantly increase the amount of
carbon
stored in the soil, so agricultural researchers are now building a case for their use in combating climate change.
One American investigation into the
potential
for storing CO2 on agricultural lands is taking place in California.
Soil scientist Whendee Silver of the University of California, Berkeley, is conducting a first-of-its-kind study on a large
cattle (Q37)
farm in the state.
She and her students are testing the effects on
carbon
storage of the
compost
that is created from waste – both agricultural, including
manure
and cornstalks, and waste produced in
gardens (Q38)
, such as leaves, branches, and lawn trimmings.
In Australia, soil ecologist Christine Jones is testing another promising soil-enrichment strategy.
Jones and 12 farmers are working to build up soil
carbon
by cultivating
grasses (Q39)
that stay green all year round.
Like composting, the approach has already been proved experimentally;
Jones now hopes to show that it can be applied on working farms and that the resulting
carbon
capture can be accurately measured.
It’s hoped in the future that projects such as these will demonstrate the role that farmers and other land managers can play in reducing the harmful effects of greenhouse gases.
For example, in countries like the United States, where most farming operations use large applications of
fertiliser
, changing such long-standing habits will require a change of system.
Rattan Lal argues that farmers should receive
payment (Q40)
not just for the corn or beef they produce, but also for the
carbon
they can store in their soil.
Another study being carried out …
