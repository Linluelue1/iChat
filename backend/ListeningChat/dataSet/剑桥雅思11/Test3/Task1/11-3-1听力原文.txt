原文
MARTIN:
Good morning.
This is Burnham tourist office, Martin speaking.
SUE:
Oh, hello.
I saw a poster about free things to do in the area, and it said people should phone you for information.
I’m coming to Burnham with my husband and two children for a few days on June the 27th, or possibly the 28th, and I’d like some ideas for things to do on the 29th.
MARTIN:
Yes, of course.
OK.
Then let’s start with a couple of events especially for children.
The art gallery is holding an event called ‘Family Welcome’ that day, when there are activities and trails to use throughout the gallery.
SUE:
That sounds interesting.
What time does it start?
MARTIN:
The gallery opens at 10, and
the ‘Family Welcome’ event runs from 10: 30 until 2 o’clock (Q1)
.
The gallery stays open until 5.
And several times during the day, they’re going to show a short film that the gallery has produced.
It demonstrates how ceramics are made (Q2)
, and there’ll be equipment and materials for children to have a go themselves.
Last time they ran the event, there was a film about painting, which went down very well with the children, and they’re now working on one about
sculpture
.
SUE:
I like the sound of that.
And what other events happen in Burnham?
MARTIN:
Well, do you all enjoy listening to music?
SUE:
Oh, yes.
MARTIN:
Well there are several free concerts taking place at different times – one or two in the morning,
the majority at lunchtime (Q3)
, and a couple in the evening.
And they range from pop music to Latin American.
SUE:
The Latin American could be fun.
What time is that?
MARTIN:
It’s being repeated several times, in different places.
They’re performing in the central library at 1 o’clock,
then at 4 it’s in the City Museum (Q4)
, and in the evening, at 7:30, there’s a longer concert, in the theatre.
SUE:
Right.
I’ll suggest that to the rest of the family.
MARTIN:
Something else you might be interested in is the boat race along the river.
SUE:
Oh, yes, do tell me about that.
MARTIN:
The race starts at Offord Marina (Q5)
, to the north of Burnham, and goes as far as Summer Pool.
The best place to watch it from is Charlesworth Bridge, though that does get rather crowded.
SUE:
And who’s taking part?
MARTIN:
Well, local boat clubs, but the standard is very high.
One of them came first in the West of England regional
championship
in May this year (Q6)
– it was the first time a team from Burnham has won.
It means that next year they’ll be representing the region in the national
championship
.
SUE:
Now I’ve heard something about Paxton Nature Reserve.
It’s a good place for spotting unusual
birds (Q7)
, isn’t it?
MARTIN:
That’s right – throughout the year.
There is a lake there, as well as a river, and they provide a very attractive habitat.
So it’s a good idea to bring
binoculars
if you have them.
And just at the moment you can see various
flowers (Q8)
that are pretty unusual – the soil at Paxton isn’t very common.
They’re looking good right now.
SUE:
Right.
My husband will be particularly interested in that.
MARTIN:
And there’s going to be a talk and slide show about
mushrooms (Q9)
– and you’ll be able to qo out and pick some afterwards and study the different varieties.
SUE:
Uhuh.
And is it possible for children to swim in the
river (Q10)
?
MARTIN:
Yes.
Part of it has been fenced off to make it safe for children to swim in.
It’s very shallow, and there’s a lifeguard on duty whenever it’s open.
The lake is too deep, so swimming isn’t allowed there.
SUE:
OK, we must remember to bring their swimming things, in case we go to Paxton.
How long does it take to get there by car from Burnham?
MARTIN:
About 20 minutes, but parking is very limited, so it’s usually much easier to go by bus – and it takes about the same time.
SUE:
Right.
Well, I’ll discuss the options with the rest of the family.
Thanks very much for all your help.
MARTIN:
You’re welcome.
SUE:
Goodbye.
MARTIN:
Bye.
