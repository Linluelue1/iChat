原文
CAROLINE:
Good Morning.
Youth Council.
Caroline speaking.
ROGER:
Oh, hello, I’m interested in standing for election to the Youth Council, and I was told to give you a call.
CAROLINE:
That’s good.
Could I have your name, please?
ROGER:
Yes, it’s Roger
(Example)
Brown.
CAROLINE:
Thank you.
I’m Caroline, the Youth Council
administrator
.
So do you know much about what the Council does, Roger?
ROGER:
I’ve talked to Stephanie – I think she’s the chair of the Council.
CAROLINE:
That’s right.
ROGER:
And she told me a lot about it.
How it’s a way for young people to discuss local issues, for example, and make suggestions to the town council.
That’s what made me interested.
CAROLINE:
Fine.
Well, let me take down some of your details.
First of all, how old are you?
You know the Council is for young people aged from 13 to 18?
ROGER:
I’ve just turned 18.
CAROLINE:
And where do you live, Roger?
ROGER:
Well, that’s a bit complicated.
At the moment I’m looking for a flat to rent here, so I’m in a
hostel (Q1)
from Monday to Friday.
I go back to my parents’ place at the weekend.
CAROLINE:
OK, SO where’s the best place to send you some information about the Council?
ROGER:
Oh, to my parents’ address, please.
That’s 17,
Buckleigh (Q2)
Street – B-U-C-K-L-E-I- G-H Street, Stamford, Lincolnshire, though you don’t really need the county.
CAROLINE:
Oh, I know Stamford – it’s a lovely town.
And what’s the postcode?
ROGER:
PE9 7QT (Q3)
CAROLINE:
Right, thank you.
So are you working here, or are you a student?
ROGER:
I started studying at the university a couple of weeks ago, and I’ve got a part-time job for a few hours a week.
CAROLINE:
What do you do?
ROGER:
Well, I’ve done several different things.
I’ve just finished a short-term
contract
as a courier, and now I’m working as a
waiter (Q4)
in one of the big hotels.
CAROLINE:
Uhuh.
That can’t leave you much time for studying!
ROGER:
Oh, it’s not too bad.
I manage to fit it all in.
CAROLINE:
What are you studying?
ROGER:
My ambition is to go into parliament
eventually
, so my major subject is
politics (Q5)
.
That’s partly why I think the Youth Council is important and want to be a part of it.
CAROLINE:
And I suppose you’re also taking a minor subject, aren’t you?
I know a lot of people study economics too.
ROGER:
I chose history.
To be honest, I’m not finding it as interesting as I expected!
CAROLINE:
OK, so with your studying and your part-time job, do you have time for any other interests or hobbies?
ROGER:
Well, I spend quite a lot of time
cycling (Q6)
– both around town to get to university and to work, and also long-distance, from here to London, for
instance
.
CAROLINE:
That’s pretty impressive!
Anything else?
ROGER:
For relaxation, I’m also keen on the
cinema (Q7)
– I used to go at least once a week, but I can’t manage to go so often now.
CAROLINE:
Right.
Are you sure you’ll have enough time for the Youth Council?
ROGER:
Yes, I’ve worked out that I can afford to reduce my hours at work, and that will make the time.
CAROLINE:
So is there any
particular
aspect of the Youth Council’s work that appeals to you, Roger?
ROGER:
Well, my sister is blind, so I’m particularly interested in working with
disabled (Q8)
young people, to try and improve the quality of their lives.
CAROLINE:
That’s great.
Well, the best way to get involved is to be nominated by some people who you know.
ROGER:
Right.
Can you tell me how to set about organising that?
CAROLINE:
You should talk to Jeffrey, our Elections Officer.
I can arrange a meeting in the council office with him, if you like.
ROGER:
Yes, please.
CAROLINE:
He’ll be here next Monday, if that suits you.
ROGER:
That’s the 14th, isn’t it?
CAROLINE:
Yes.
ROGER:
I can manage late afternoon.
CAROLINE:
Would you like to suggest a time?
He generally leaves around 5:30.
ROGER:
Well, would
4:30 (Q9)
be OK?
My last class finishes at 4, so I’d have plenty of time to get to your office.
CAROLINE:
Right, that’s fine.
Oh, and could I have a phone number we can contact you on?
ROGER:
Yes, my mobile number’s
07788 136711 (Q10)
.
CAROLINE:
Thank you.
Well, we’ll look forward to seeing you next week.
ROGER:
Thanks very much.
Goodbye.
CAROLINE:
Bye.
