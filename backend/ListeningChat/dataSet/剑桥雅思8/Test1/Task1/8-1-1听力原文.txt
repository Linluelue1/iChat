剑桥雅思8 Test 1 Section 1听力原文与答案 Summer Music Festival
剑桥雅思8听力第一套题目的这篇Section 1算是旅游场景与订票场景的结合。包括前往参加音乐节的原因，座位安排，一些个人信息，以及节目信息等内容。题目整体难度不算太大。易错点主要是第7题的pianist。一方面这个单词不少同学都不太熟悉。另一方面答案出来的也比较突然，很容易反应不过来。

原文
NINA: Hi, George! Glad you’re back. Loads of people have phoned you.
GEORGE: Really?
NINA: I felt just like your secretary!
GEORGE: Sorry! I went into the library this afternoon to have a look at a newspaper and I came across something really interesting.
NINA: What? A book?
GEORGE: NO, a
brochure
from a summer festival – mainly Spanish music. Look, I’ve got it here.
Example
NINA:  Spanish music? I really love the guitar. Let’s have a look. So what’s this group ‘Guitarrini’?
GEORGE: They’re really good. They had
a video
with all the highlights of the festival at a stand in the lobby to the library, so I heard them. They play fantastic instruments – drums and flutes and old kinds of guitars. I’ve never heard anything like it before.
Q1
NINA: Sounds great.
GEORGE: Okay. Shall we go then? Spoil ourselves?
NINA: Yes, let’s.
GEORGE: The only problem is there aren’t any cheap seats. . . it’s all one price.
NINA: Well, in that case we could sit right at the front – we’d have a really good view.
GEORGE: Yeah, though I think that if you sit at the back
you can actually hear the whole thing better.  Q2
NINA: Yes. Anyway we can decide when we get there.
NINA: So will you fill in the form or shall I?
GEORGE: I’ll do it. Name George O’Neill. Address:
48 North Avenue
, Westsea
. Do you remember our new postcode? Still can’t remember it.
Q3
NINA: Just a minute – I’ve got it written down here.
WS6 2YH
. Do you need the phone too?
Q4
GEORGE: Please. I’m really bad at numbers.
NINA:
01674 553242
. SO, let’s book two tickets for Guitarrini.
Q5
GEORGE: Okay. If you’re sure ￡7. 50 each is all right. How do you feel about the singer?
NINA: I haven’t quite decided. But I’ve noticed something on the booking form that might just persuade me!
GEORGE: What’s that then?
NINA: Free refreshments!
GEORGE: Really?
NINA: Yes, look here. Sunday 17th of June. Singer, ticket ￡6. 00 includes
drinks
in the garden.
Q6
GEORGE: Sounds like a bargain to me!
NINA: Yes, let’s book two tickets for that. So, what else? I’m feeling quite keen now! How about the
pianist
on the 22nd of June? Q7
GEORGE: Anna Ventura? I’ve just remembered that’s my evening class night.
NINA: That’s okay. I’ll just have to go on my own – but we can go to the Spanish dance and guitar concert together, can’t we?
GEORGE: Yes – I’m sure Tom and Kieran would enjoy that too. Good heavens
￡10.50
a ticket! I can see we’re going to have to go without food for the rest of the week – we’ll need to book
four
!
Q8 Q9
NINA: Wish we were students – look! Children, Students and Senior Citizens get a
50%
discount on everything.
Q10
GEORGE: if only!
