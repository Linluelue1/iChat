原文
JUDY:         Good morning. Total Insurance. Judy speaking, how may I help you?
MICHAEL:       I recently shipped my belongings from overseas back here to Australia and I took out insurance with your company. Some items were damaged during the move so I need to make a claim. What do I have to do?
JUDY:         Okay, well first I need to get a few details about this. Can you give me your name please?
MICHAEL:       Yes. It’s
Michael Alexander
(
Example
).
JUDY:         Okay. And your address please?
MICHAEL:       My old address or my current one?
JUDY:          Your current one.
MICHAEL:       It’s 24 Manly Street, Milperra near Sydney.
JUDY:         What was the suburb, sorry?
MICHAEL:      Milperra.
M-I-L-P-E-R-R-A
. (
Q1
)
JUDY:         Right. Now, who was the shipping agent Mr Alexander?
MICHAEL:      You mean the company we used?
JUDY:         Yes, the company who packed everything up at the point of origin.
MICHAEL:      Oh, it was. . . er. . .
First Class Movers
(
Q2
).
JUDY:         Okay. . . where were the goods shipped from?
MICHAEL:      China, but the ship came via Singapore and was there for about a week.
JUDY:         Don’t worry, all of that information will be in the documentation. Now, the dates. Do you know when the ship arrived?
MICHAEL:       It left on the 11th of October and got to Sydney on the
28th of November
(
Q3
).
JUDY:         Okay. I need one more thing. There’s a reference number. It should be in the top right-hand corner of the pink form they gave you.
MICHAEL:       Let me have a look. I have so many papers. Yes, here it is. It’s 601 ACK.
JUDY:         Thanks.
JUDY:         I need to take down a few details of the actual damage over the phone before you put in a full report. Can you tell me how many items were damaged and what the damage was?
MICHAEL:      Yes, well four things actually. I’ll start with the big things. My TV first of all. It’s a large one. . . very expensive.
JUDY:         Our insurance doesn’t cover electrical problems.
MICHAEL:       It isn’t an electrical problem.
The
screen
has a huge crack
(
Q4
) in it so it’s unusable.
JUDY:         I see. Any idea of the price to repair it?
MICHAEL:       NO. Well, I don’t think it can be repaired. It will need a new one.
JUDY:         Okay. I’ll make a note of that and we’ll see what we can do. Now, what was the second item?
MICHAEL:       The cabinet from the
bathroom
(
Q5
) was damaged as well. It’s a lovely cabinet, we use it to keep our towels in.
JUDY:         And what is the extent of the damage?
MICHAEL:       Well, the back and the sides seem okay but the
door
has a huge hole in it. (
Q6
)It can’t be repaired. I’m really not very happy about it.
JUDY:         And how much do you think it will cost to replace it?
MICHAEL:      Well, when I bought it last year I paid $125 for it. But the one I’ve seen here in Sydney is a bit more expensive, it’s
$140
. (
Q7
)
JUDY:         Right, and what was the third item?
MICHAEL:      My dining room table. It’s a lovely table from Indonesia. It must have been very hot inside the container because one
leg
has completely split (
Q8
) down the middle. The top and the other three look okay thank goodness.
JUDY:         Any idea of the price to repair it?
MICHAEL:      Well, I had an estimate done on this actually because it is a very special table to us. They quoted us $200, which is really pricey so I hope the insurance will cover the total cost.
JUDY:         I’m sure that will be fine. What was the last item, Mr Alexander?
MICHAEL:      Well, we have a lovely set of china plates and dishes, you know, with matching cups, saucers, the lot. They were all in the one box which must have got dropped because some
plates
(
Q9
) were broken – six actually.
JUDY:         And can you tell me the replacement value of these?
MICHAEL:      Well, it’s hard to say because they were part of a set but they can be up to $10 each as it’s such a good set.
JUDY:         Okay, so that would be around
$60
(
Q10
) altogether?
MICHAEL:      Yes, that’s right.
JUDY:         And is that all of the items?
MICHAEL:      Yes. So what do I have to do now?
