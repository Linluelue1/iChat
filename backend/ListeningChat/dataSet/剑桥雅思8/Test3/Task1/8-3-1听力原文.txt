剑桥雅思8Test3Section1听力原文与答案 Rented Properties customer’s requirements
剑桥雅思8听力第三套题目第一部分的主题为租房场景，内容涉及理想房子的位置，心理预期的房价，租住的时间，对四所房子的介绍等。整体难度不算太大。易错点主要是后面多选题的B选项。录音中提到明年要把现有的音乐厅换成更大的，即现在音乐厅还开着。但不少同学听到更换就直接排除了这一选项。

原文
WOMAN:       Good morning. How can I help you?
MAN:          Hello. I’m interested in renting a house somewhere in the town.
WOMAN:       Right. Could I have your name please?
MAN:          Yes, it’s Steven Godfrey.
WOMAN:       And tell me how many bedrooms you’re looking for.
MAN:          Well, we’d need
four (Example)
, because I’m going to share the house with three friends.
WOMAN:       Okay, there are several of that size on our books. They mostly belong to families who are working abroad at the moment. What about the location?
MAN:          It’d be nice to be
central (Q1)
.
WOMAN:       That might be difficult, as most houses of that size are in the suburbs. Still, there are a few. What’s your upper limit for the rent?
MAN:          We’d like something around ￡500 a month, but we could go up to
￡600 (Q2)
if  we have to. But we can’t go beyond that.
WOMAN:       Do you know how long you want to rent the house for? The minimum let is six months, as you probably realise.
MAN:          We’re at college here for
two years
(Q3)
, and we don’t want to have to move during that time if we can avoid it.
WOMAN:       Right. And how soon do you want to move in? All our lets start on the first of the month.
MAN:          Well, as soon as possible, really, so that means September 1st
WOMAN:       Okay, let me have a look at what we’ve got…. We have photographs of all the houses on our books, so you can get an idea of what they’re like. There’s this one in Oakington Avenue, at ￡550 a month. Combined living room and dining room, with a separate kitchen. It doesn’t have a
garage (Q4)
, though you can park in the road.
MAN:          Ah, we’d prefer to have one, if possible.
WOMAN:       Right. Then have a look at this house, in Mead Street. It’s got a very large living room and kitchen, bathroom, cloakroom. . .
MAN:          How much is it?
WOMAN:       That one’s 580. It’s very well furnished and equipped. It also has plenty of space for parking, and it’s available for a minimum of a year. Oh, and there’s a big
garden (Q5)
.
MAN:          I don’t think we could cope with that, to be honest. We’ll be too busy to look after it.
WOMAN:       Okay. Then there’s this older house in Hamilton Road: living room, kitchen-diner, and it has a
study (Q6)
. 550 a month.
MAN:          That looks rather nice. But whereabouts in Hamilton Road?
WOMAN:       Towards the western end.
MAN:          Oh, that’ll be very
noisy (Q7)
. I know the area.
WOMAN:       Yes, it’s pretty lively. Some people like it, though. Well, what about this house in Devon Close?
MAN:          That looks lovely.
WOMAN:       There’s a big demand for houses in that area, so prices tend to be quite high. But this one hasn’t been decorated for a few years, which has kept the rent down a bit. It’s got a living room, dining room and small kitchen, and it’s
595
(Q8)
a month. I think it would suit you, from what you’ve said.
MAN:          It sounds fine.
MAN:          Why’s that part of town so popular?
WOMAN:       Well, there’s a big scheme to improve the district, and it’ll soon have the best facilities for miles around.
MAN:          What sort of thing?
WOMAN:       There’s a big sports centre under construction, which will be very impressive when it’s finished. In fact,
the swimming pool’s already opened (Q9)
, ahead of schedule, and it’s attracting a lot of people.
MAN:          What about cinemas: are there any in the area?
WOMAN:       The only one closed down last year, and it’s now in the process of being converted into a film museum. The local people are trying to get a new cinema added to the scheme.
MAN:          I think I heard something about a plan to replace
the existing concert hall (Q10)
with a larger one.
WOMAN:       Ah, that’s due to start next year.
MAN:          Well it sounds an interesting area to live in. Could I go and see the house, please?
WOMAN:        Yes, of course.
