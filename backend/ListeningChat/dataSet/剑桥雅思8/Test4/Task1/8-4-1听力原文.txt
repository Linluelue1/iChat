原文
WOMAN:       Hello, West Bay Hotel. Can I help you?
MAN:              Oh, good morning. I’m ringing about your advertisement in the Evening Gazette.
WOMAN’        IS that the one for
temporary (Example)
staff?
MAN:              That’s right.
WOMAN:       Yes. I’m afraid the person who’s dealing with that isn’t in today, but I can give you the main details if you like.
MAN:              Yes please. Could you tell me what kind of staff you are looking for?
WOMAN:       We’re looking for
waiters (Q1)
at the moment. There was one post for a cook,   but that’s already been taken.
MAN:              Oh right. Erm, what are the hours of work?
WOMAN:       There are two different shifts – there’s a day shift from 7 to 2 and a late shift from 4 till 11.
MAN:              And can people choose which one they want to do?
WOMAN:       Not normally, because everyone would choose the day shift I suppose. You alternate from one week to another.
MAN:              Okay. I’m just writing all this down. What about time off?
WOMAN:       You get one
day off
(Q2)
and I think you can negotiate which one you want, it’s more or less up to you. But it has to be the same one every week.
MAN:              DO you know what the rates of pay are?
WOMAN:       Yes, I’ve got them here. You get ￡5. 50 an hour, and that includes a
break (Q3)
.
MAN:              DO I have to go home to eat or. . .
WOMAN:       You don’t have to. You can get a
meal
in the hotel
(Q4)
if you want to, and     there’s no charge for it so you might as well.
MAN:              Oh good. Yes, so let’s see. I’d get er, two hundred and twenty one, no, two hundred and thirty one pounds a week?
WOMAN:       You’d also get tips – our guests tend to be quite generous.
MAN:              Erm, is there a uniform? What about clothes?
WOMAN:       Yes, I forgot to mention that. You need to wear a white shirt, just a plain one, and
dark (Q5)
trousers. You know, not green or anything like that. And we don’t supply those.
MAN:              That’s okay, I’ve got trousers, I’d just have to buy a couple of shirts. What about anything else? Do I need a waistcoat or anything?
WOMAN:       YOU have to wear a
jacket
(Q6)
, but the hotel lends you that.
MAN:              I see. Er, one last thing – I don’t know what the starting date is.
WOMAN:       Just a minute, I think it’s some time
around the end of June. Yes, the 28th,
(Q7)
in time for the summer.
MAN:             That’s great. I’m available from the 10th.
WOMAN:       Oh good. Well, if you can call again you need to speak to the Service Manager. Her name’s Jane Urwin, that’s
U-R-W-I-N (Q8)
, and she’ll probably arrange to meet you.
MAN:              Okay. And when’s the best time to ring?
WOMAN:        Could you call tomorrow? Urn, she usually starts checking the rooms at
midday
(Q9)
,
so before then if you can
,
so she’ll have more time to chat. I’ll just give you her number because she’s got a direct line.
MAN:              Thanks.
WOMAN:       It’s 832 double-0 9.
MAN:              823 double-0 9?
WOMAN:       832.
MAN:              Oh, okay. Yes, I’ll do that.
WOMAN:       And by the way, she will ask you for a
reference (Q10)
, so you might like to be   thinking about that. You know, just someone who knows you and can vouch for you.
MAN:              Yes, no problem. Well, thanks very much for your help.
WOMAN:        You’re welcome. Bye.
MAN:              Bye.
