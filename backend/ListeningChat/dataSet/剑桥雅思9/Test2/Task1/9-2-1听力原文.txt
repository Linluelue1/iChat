原文
MAN:           Good morning. Can I help you?
WOMAN:        Yes. I’ve just been accepted on a course at the university and I’d like to try and arrange accommodation in the
hall of residence
.
Example
MAN:           Yes, certainly. Please sit down. What I’ll do is fill in a form with you to find out a little more about your preferences and so forth.
WOMAN:        Thank you.
MAN:           So first of all, can I take your name?
WOMAN:        It’s Anu
Bhatt
.
(Q1)
MAN;           Could you spell your name, please?
WOMAN:         Yes. A-N-U … B-H-A double T.
MAN:           Thanks, and could I ask your date of birth?
WOMAN:
31st
March 1972. (Q2)
MAN:           Thank you. And where are you from?
WOMAN:        India.
MAN:           Oh right. And what will you be studying?
WOMAN:        I’m doing a course in
nursing (Q3)
.
MAN:           Right, thank you. And how long would you want to stay in hall, do you think?
WOMAN:        Well, it’ll take three years but I’d only like to stay in hall for
two (Q4)
. I’d like to think about living outside for the third year.
MAN:           Fine. And what did you have in mind for catering? Do you want to cook for yourself or have all your meals provided, that’s full board?
WOMAN:        Is there something in between?
MAN:           Yes. You can just have evening meal provided, which is half board.
WOMAN:        That’s what I’d prefer.
MAN:           Yes, a lot of students opt for that. Now, with that in mind, do you have any special diet, anything we should know about?
WOMAN:        Yes, I don’t take
red meat
(Q5)
.
MAN:           No red meat.
MAN:           Now, thinking about the room itself, we have a number of options. You can have a single study bedroom or you can have a shared one. These are both what we call simple rooms. The other alternative is to opt for a single bedsit which actually has more space and better facilities. There’s about £20 a week difference between them.
WOMAN:       Well, actually my grant is quite generous and I think the
bedsit
(Q6)
sounds the best option .
MAN:         Lovely. I’ll put you down for that and we’ll see what availability is like. Now can I ask some other personal details which we like to have on record?
WOMAN:      Yes, of course.
MAN:          I wonder if you could let us know what your interests are. This might help us get a closer match for placing you in a particular hall.
WOMAN:       Ummm. Well, I love the
theatre
(Q7)
.
MAN:         Right.
WOMAN:       And I enjoy sports, particularly badminton.
MAN:          That’s worth knowing. Now, what we finish with on the form is really a list from you of what your priorities are in choosing a hall and we’ll do our best to take these into account.
WOMAN:       Well, the first thing is I’d prefer a hall where there are other
mature students (Q8)
, if possible.
MAN:         Yes, we do have halls which tend to cater for slightly older students.
WOMAN:       Ummm and I’d prefer to be out of
town (Q9)
.
MAN:          That’s actually very good for you because we tend to have more vacancies in out-of-town halls.
WOMAN:       Lucky!
MAN:          Yes. Anything else?
WOMAN:       Well, I would like somewhere with a
shared
area
(Q10)
, a TV room for example, or something like that. It’s a good way to socialise.
MAN:          It certainly is.
WOMAN:       That’s it.
MAN:          Now, we just need a contact telephone number for you.
WOMAN:       Sure, I’ll just find it. It’s double 67549.
MAN:          Great, so we’ll be in contact with you as soon as possible …
