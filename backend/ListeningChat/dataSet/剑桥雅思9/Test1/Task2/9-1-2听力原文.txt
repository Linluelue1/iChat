原文
ANDREW:  NOW we go to Jane who is going to tell us about what’s happening in town this weekend.
JANE:     Right, thanks, Andrew, and now on to what’s new, and do we really need yet another sports shop in Bradcaster? Well, most of you probably know Sports World –
the
branch (Q11)
of a Danish sports goods company
that opened a few years ago – it’s attracted a lot of custom, and so the company has now decided to open another branch in the area. It’s going to be in the shopping centre to the
west
(Q12)
of Bradcaster, so that will be good news for all of you who’ve found the original shop in the north of the town hard to get to.
I was invited to a special preview and I can promise you, this is the ultimate in sports retailing. The whole place has been given a new minimalist look with the company’s signature colours of black and red. The first three floors have a huge range of sports
clothing (Q13)
as well as equipment, and on the top floor there’s a cafe and a book and DVD section. You’ll find all the well-known names as well as some less well- known ones. If they haven’t got exactly what you want in stock they promise to get it for you in
ten (Q14)
days. Unlike the other store, where it can take up to fourteen days. They cover all the major sports, including football, tennis and swimming, but they particularly focus on
running (Q15)
, and they claim to have the widest range of equipment in the country. As well as that, a whole section of the third floor is devoted to
sports bags (Q16)
, including the latest designs from the States – if you can’t find what you want here, it doesn’t exist!
The shop will be open from 9.00 am this Saturday and if you go along to the opening then you’ll have the chance to meet the national 400 metres running champion Paul King, who’s coming along to open the shop, and
he will be staying around until about midday (Q17)
to chat to any fans who want to meet him and sign autographs.
Then there will be a whole range of special attractions all weekend. There will be free tickets for local sporting events for the first 50 customers, and also a special competition open to all. Just answer fifteen out of twenty sports questions correctly to win a signed copy of Paul King’s DVD ‘Spring Tips’, while
the first person to get all the questions correct gets a year’s
free membership of the Bradcaster Gym (Q18)
. All entrants will receive a special Sports calendar with details of all Bradcaster fixtures in the coming year.
One of the special opening offers is a fitness test – a complete review of your cardiac fitness and muscle tone, actually done in the shop by qualified staff.
This would normally cost £30.00 but is available at half price for this month only (Q19). There are only a limited number of places available for this, so to make a booking (Q20)
phone 560341. In addition, if you open an account you get lots more special offers including the chance to try out equipment at special open evenings …
