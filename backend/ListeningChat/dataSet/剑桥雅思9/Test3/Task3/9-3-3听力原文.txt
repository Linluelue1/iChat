原文
TUTOR:
Ah Caroline … come on in. Sit down.
CAROLINE:
Thanks.
TUTOR:
So how’s the dissertation planning going?
CAROLINE:
Well Dr Schulmann, I’m still having a lot of trouble deciding on a title.
TUTOR:
Well, that’s perfectly normal at this stage. And this is what your tutorials will help you to do.
CAROLINE:
Right.
TUTOR:
What we’ll do is jot down some points that might help you in your decision. First of all, you have chosen your general topic area, haven’t you?
CAROLINE:
Yes, it’s the
fishing industry (Q21)
.
TUTOR:
Oh yes, that was one of the areas you mentioned. Now, what aspects of the course are you good at?
CAROLINE:
Well, I think I’m coping well with
statistics (Q22)
, and I’m never bored by it.
TUTOR:
Good. Anything else?
CAROLINE:
Well, I found computer modelling fascinating – I have no problem following what’s being taught, whereas quite a few of my classmates find it difficult.
TUTOR:
Well, that’s very good. Do you think these might be areas you could bring into your dissertation?
CAROLINE:
Oh yes, if possible. It’s just that I’m having difficulty thinking how I can do that. You see I feel I don’t have sufficient background information.
TUTOR:
I see. Well, do you take notes?
CAROLINE:
I’m very weak at
note-taking (Q23)
. My teachers always used to say that.
TUTOR:
Well, I think you really need to work on these weaknesses before you go any further.
CAROLINE:
What do you suggest?
TUTOR:
Well, I can go through the possible strategies with you and let you decide where to go from there.
CAROLINE:
Okay, thanks.
TUTOR:
Well, some people find it helpful to organise peer-group discussions – you know, each week a different person studies a different topic and shares it with the group.
CAROLINE:
Oh right.
TUTOR:
It really helps build
confidence (Q24)
, you know, having to present something to others.
CAROLINE:
I can see that.
TUTOR:
The drawback is that everyone in the group seems to share the same
ideas (Q25)
… they keep being repeated in all the dissertations.
CAROLINE:
Okay.
TUTOR:
You could also try a service called ‘
Student Support
‘
(Q26)
. It’s designed to give you a structured programme over a number of weeks to develop your skills.
CAROLINE:
Sounds good.
TUTOR:
Yes, unfortunately, there are only a few
places (Q27)
. But it’s worth looking into.
CAROLINE:
Yes, of course. I know I’ve got to work on my study skills.
TUTOR:
And then there are several study skills books you can consult.
CAROLINE:
Right.
TUTOR:
They’ll be a good source of reference but the problem is they are sometimes too
general (Q28)
.
CAROLINE:
Yes, that’s what I’ve found.
TUTOR:
Other than that I would strongly advise quite simple ideas like using a card index.
CAROLINE:
Well, yes, I’ve never done that before.
TUTOR:
It’s simple, but it really works because you have to get points down in a small space. Another thing I always advise is don’t just take your notes and forget about them. Read everything
three times (29)
– that’ll really fix them in your mind.
CAROLINE:
Yes, I can see it’d take discipline but …
TUTOR:
Well, if you establish good study skills at this stage they’ll be with you all your life.
CAROLINE:
Oh yes, I completely agree. It’s just that I don’t seem to be able to discipline myself. I need to talk things over.
TUTOR:
Well, we’ll be continuing these tutorials of course. Let’s arrange next month’s now. Let’s see, I can see you virtually any time during the week starting  January
CAROLINE:
What about the? I’m free in the afternoon.
TUTOR:
Sorry, I’m booked then. What about the following day?
CAROLINE:
Thursday? I can make the morning.
TUTOR:
Fine, we’ll go for the
25th (Q30)
then.
CAROLINE:
That’s great, thanks.
