剑桥雅思6 test 2 Section 2听力原文与答案 train information
这篇Section 2无论是从听力录音的推进，还是讨论的话题方面其实都更像是Section 1的内容。首先，按照雅思官方的说法，Section 2应该是独白，但这道题前半部分明显是对话。其次，Section 2的场景通常为组织机构、活动、以及景点的介绍，而非这篇的交通咨询。
易错点主要是第11题和第14题。11题采用了语序颠倒的出题方式，而且king street作为车站名超出了不少同学的认知，导致反应不过来。第14题则主要是单词，如果不知道refreshment有食物的意思就难很多。至于后面的多选虽然也有一定难度，但无论是干扰项的设置还是同义替换都是常见的套路，因此不能算作易错点。

原文
CUSTOMER:           Hello. Um my family and I are staying here in Trebirch for a week or two and we wanted to know about the train services. We’re hoping to do a few local trips.
RAILPERSON:         OK. Well, I can give you lots of details about all the trains going from Trebirch in the South West. This leaflet will be very helpful but I can tell you some of the main things. We’ve got two main train stations in the town.
King Street
is for local commuter lines and regional services.
Q11
CUSTOMER:           What about trains to London? I’ll need to go there on business for one day.
RAILPERSON:         Then you need to go to
Central
Station – that’s for all the national services. There are regular trains to London. They leave Trebirch
every half hour
on weekdays and every hour at weekends. It takes about two hours, a bit longer on Sundays. You’ve got a choice of first and second class and there’s a buffet car – though
refreshments
are included in the cost of a first class ticket.
Q12  Q13  Q14
CUSTOMER:           Ah right. Um, and have you got any information on different ticket types?
RAILPERSON:         Yes. There’s a range of ticket prices depending on when you travel and when you buy your ticket. There’s a standard open ticket which doesn’t have any restrictions. This can be bought in advance or on the day. You can also get various discounted tickets. A popular one is called the Supersave and, er, this is OK for travel after 8.45. Then there is the Special ticket, which is valid for travel after
10.15
. The Special tickets are also valid for travel at weekends. The cheapest tickets are called
Advance
and you have to buy them at least six days ahead. Only a certain number are available and you have to make seat
reservations
for these.
Q15  Q16  Q17
CUSTOMER:           Thanks. And are there lots of places to go to around here?
RAILPERSON:      Oh yes. You can enjoy many days out. Um there’s the Merthyr
Mining Museum
, which is only half an hour from Trebirch by train. Your children will find it just as fascinating as any theme park and they can ride in the original miners’ lifts and on the coal trains. There are special excursion tickets which include entrance fees. Mainline trains also offer direct services to Bristol, where you can visit the docks or spend a great day out with the children in the
zoo
, which is set in the parkland that used to surround the old castle. Er, special family awayday fares are available for this service now during the school holidays. Er, alternatively, you can be in Birmingham in only an hour and a half, where there’s lots to see and do including the new and internationally-acclaimed
climbing wall
built on the site of the old aquarium. We will also be running a special service to Newport when the new science museum opens next year, as we anticipate a lot of visitors in the opening weeks. I’d advise you to call early to book your tickets. Is that OK?
Q18  Q19  Q20
CUSTOMER:           Yes, thanks.
