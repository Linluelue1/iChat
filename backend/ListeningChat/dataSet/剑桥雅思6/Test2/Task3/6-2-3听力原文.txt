原文
TUTOR:                   Hello, Sandy. How have you been getting on with your dissertation?
SANDY:                   Fine, and I’ve been working hard on the various action points we agreed on our last tutorial.
TUTOR:                   Do you want to talk me through what you’ve done?
SANDY:                   Yeah, sure. Well, we agreed on three main targets for me to aim for. The first one was to find out about suitable data analysis software.
TUTOR:                   Yes.
SANDY:                   And what I decided to do was to look through
catalogues
specialising in IT.
Q21
TUTOR:                   That’s a good idea. What did you come up with?
SANDY:                   I found the names of two promising ones.
TUTOR:                   Right.
SANDY:                   But I also thought it’d be worthwhile talking to a lecturer.
TUTOR:                   Oh right. Who did you see?
SANDY:                   Jane Prince. Do you know her? She’s in the
Computer Centre
.
Q22
TUTOR:                   Yes, of course, she’s the new Head.
SANDY:                   Yes. Well, she was very helpful.
TUTOR:                   Oh, that’s good. Did she suggest anything in particular?
SANDY：                Yeah. She recommended software called Vivat and said I should book up for a couple of practice sessions using Vivat.
TUTOR:                   Great. I’m sure you’ll find them useful.
SANDY:                   And, of course, the second target was to draw up a survey
checklist
which I…
Q23
TUTOR:                   Yes, you emailed me it last week.
SANDY:                   Have you had a chance to look…?
TUTOR:                   Of course, um I think it’s good. Very much on the right lines. I’d say your first two sections are spot on. I wouldn’t suggest that you change anything there, but in section three you really do need to have questions on
teaching experience
.
Q24
SANDY:                   Yeah. I was thinking that section looked a bit short.
TUTOR:                   Right.
SANDY:                   And my third target was, do further reading on discipline.
TUTOR:                   Oh yes. I mentioned a couple of writers, didn’t I?
SANDY:                   Yes, well I got hold of the Banerjee and I thought that was excellent. But I’m afraid I didn’t manage to get hold of the essays about
classroom
management – you know, the ones by Simon Ericsson. The bookshop said it was out of print and the library doesn’t have a copy.
Q25
TUTOR:                   Oh right, and I’m afraid I’ve lent my copy to another student. What I suggest you do is try the library again – this time apply for it through the service called special loans. Have you done that before? You’re entitled to six books a year.
SANDY:                   Yes. No problem. That’s what I’ll do.
TUTOR:                   SO, lots of useful work done.
TUTOR:                   So, let’s look at some new targets. We’ll start by having a chat about your Chapter One. I very much enjoyed reading it. Your written style is very clear and you’ve included lots of interesting descriptions of education in your target area. I’ve just got a couple of suggestions for some additional work.
SANDY:                   Of course. Could I just ask – what do you think I should call it?
TUTOR:                   Well, I’d go for something like Context
Review
. What do you think?
Q26
SANDY:                   Well, short and to the point.
TUTOR:                   Exactly. Now, as regards specific areas to work on, I’d be quite interested to have a few more statistics about the
schools
in the different zones.
Q27
SANDY:                   Oh, that wouldn’t be a problem. I can get them from the Internet.
TUTOR:                   Great, and although you did make a reference to quite a few different writers, I think you should aim to cite more works written later than
2000
.
Q28
SANDY:                   OK. That’s more difficult, but I can try. When do you want that done by?
TUTOR:                   Oh, it’s not urgent. Um I should aim for the
end of term
. But in the meantime, I think you should also be thinking about Chapter Two.
Q29
SANDY:                   Should I be drafting it already?
TUTOR:                   No, but I think you should note down its main sections.
SANDY:                   Yes. You know, I always find that the hardest part.
TUTOR:                   I always find it helpful to put some ideas on index cards.
SANDY:                   Yeah.
TUTOR:                   Um… and then you can sort them, and even lay them out on the floor. It’s a real help.
SANDY:                   Well, I’ll certainly try it! When would the deadline be for that?
TUTOR:                 My advice would be to get it done before you embark upon the
research
. You can always change it later if you need to.
Q30
SANDY:                   OK. I’ll get going on that then.
