剑桥雅思6 test 2 Section 1听力原文与答案 children’s art and craft workshops
这篇雅思听力Section 1是典型的课程咨询场景，即家长要为自己的孩子报名某种辅导班，询问课程开始的日期、类型、适宜人群、地点、需要携带的物品等内容(
雅思备考听力篇 剑6 test 2 section 1 雅思听力高频词汇
)。题型方面，前5道题的单句填空非常贴近目前考试的趋势，后5道题的表格也经常在Section 1中出现。
易错点主要是第1题和第8题。其中第1题的8跟后面的years有连读，听起来有些像18。也有些同学因为比较着急，写成了前面的5。第8题则主要是词汇的问题，不少同学因为不知道top可以表示瓶盖的意思，犹犹豫豫不敢写导致出现错误。

雅思听力
原文
MAN:                        Good morning, Synmouth Museum. Can I help you?
WOMAN:                 Oh yes. Good morning. I’m interested in the children’s workshops and I’d like a little more information, please.
MAN:                       Do you mean the Art and Craft workshops?
WOMAN:                 Yes. A friend of a friend mentioned them – the children do painting and make models and so forth.
MAN:                       Yes, of course. Um, where to begin? First of all, as you probably know, they run every
Saturday
.
Example
WOMAN:                 Fine. And what about ages?
MAN:                       Well, all ages from five upwards are welcome, though we do ask that children below
eight
years of age are accompanied by an adult.
Q1
WOMAN:                 Fine. That wouldn’t be a problem. What about cost?
MAN:                       Well, I think you’ll find them very reasonable. It’s ￡2.50 a child, with 80 pence off for two or more children from the same family.
WOMAN:                 Oh yes, very reasonable. And are they held in the main museum?
MAN:                       Not exactly. They’re nearby.
WOMAN:                 Could you give me the full address? I don’t know the area very well.
MAN:                       Yes, it’s Winter House.
WOMAN:                 Right.
MAN:                       And that’s in Tamer Street.
WOMAN:                 Could you spell that please?
MAN:                       Yes,
T-A-M-E-R Street
.
Q2
WOMAN:                 Lovely.
MAN:                       And I do need to tell you that there’s a security entrance, so you need to press the
green button
for someone to let you in. Don’t press the red button please, but don’t worry, it’s all clearly labelled.
Q3
WOMAN:                 OK. And one more question – is parking available nearby? We’re driving in from out of town.
MAN:                       Your best bet is to leave your car at the back of the
library
– on a Saturday morning there are plenty of spaces there. It’s right next door to the museum.
Q4
WOMAN:                 And can I ask about booking places?
MAN:                       Yes, and I must tell you, you really should book by calling the
education department
here.
Q5
WOMAN:                 Oh, I’m sorry, should I have rung them instead of the main museum number?
MAN:                       No, that’s fine this time, please don’t worry. But for future reference, I’ll give you the direct number. It’s two hundred-seven-six-five.
WOMAN:                 Great, I’ve got that.
MAN:                       But I’m very happy to give you information about the next two workshops. On Saturday the 16th there’s Building
Castles
.
Q6
WOMAN:                 Oh, sounds great!
MAN:                       This involves quite a bit of glue, so just make sure the kids are in
old clothes
.
Q7
WOMAN:                 I know, ones I don’t mind getting mucky.
MAN:                       Exactly. And if possible, could you bring along
bottle tops
which the children might be able to use in the models, you know, as decoration?
Q8
WOMAN:                 We’ll certainly try to find some for you.
MAN:                       Then the following week…
WOMAN:                 That’ll be the 23rd, won’t it?
MAN:                       Yes, that’s right. On that day, it’s what we call
Undersea Worlds
. This is where they make scenes with fishes, underground caverns and so on.
Q9
WOMAN:                 Is that likely to get very dirty? Lots of paint splashes?
MAN:                       Not really, so we don’t recommend any special clothes for that one. But if you could search out some
silver paper
to bring along to use in the sessions, you know, it’s shiny – it looks like water, that’d be great.
Q10
WOMAN:                 Yes, of course. We’ll see what we can come up with. Well, thank you ever so much for all your help. The sessions sound really good and I’ll certainly book up for the next two.
MAN:                       Lovely. Thanks very much for ringing.
WOMAN:                 Bye.
MAN:                       Bye-bye.
