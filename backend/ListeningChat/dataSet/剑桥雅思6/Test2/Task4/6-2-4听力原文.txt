剑桥雅思6 test 2 Section 4听力原文与答案 the history of moving pictures
这篇雅思听力Section 4讲述了电影的发展史，算是Section 4的常规内容。虽然题型上采用了选择+单句填空这种不太常见的组合方式，但好在选择题并不算难，尤其是跟一般Section 4的选择题相比，简直简单的可爱。
易错点方面主要是34题和38题。34题本身没有任何难度，只要听到了肯定能选出来，但坏就坏在它离33题实在太近。很多同学都是还在思考33呢，34题就给过去了。38题则是出来的太过突然，不仅没有什么明显的提示词，而且出现了语序颠倒的情况，很容易反应不过来。

原文
Many believe that the story first began in America in 1877, when two friends were arguing over whether a horse ever had all four feet or hooves off the ground when it galloped. To settle the bet, a photographer was asked to photograph a horse galloping and the bet was settled because you could see that
all the hooves were off the ground in some of the photos
. What was even more interesting was that if the photos were shown in quick succession the horse looked like it was running – in other words ‘moving pictures’.
Q31
The person who became interested in taking the moving pictures to its next step was the famous American inventor Thomas Edison. Actually, he didn’t do the work himself but rather asked a young Scotsman in his employ to design a system, which he did. Now this young fellow was clever because the first thing he did was study other systems – primitive as they were – of moving pictures and then
put all the existing technologies together to make the first entire motion picture system
. He designed a camera, a projection device and the film. The system was first shown in New York in 1894 and was really very popular. Apparently people lined up around the block to see the wonderful new invention. There were, however, a couple of problems with the system.
The camera weighed over 200 kilograms
and only one person at a time could see the film.
Q32      Q33
Well now, news of the new system in America travelled fast and
a number of rival European systems started to appear once people had heard about it
. The single problem with all the systems was they couldn’t really project the film onto a screen – you know, so more than one person could see it.
Then in 1895, three systems were all developed, more or less at the same time and independently of each other. I guess the most famous of these was by the Lumière Brothers from France
, and they called their system the cinematographe which of course is where the word cinema comes from. There were also two brothers in Germany who developed a successful system and they called it a bioskop.
Q34    Q35
Well now, once the problem of projection had been solved, the next challenge for the inventors was to make the films longer and more interesting. A continuing problem at the time was that the
films had a tendency to break when they were being played – a problem which was caused by the tension between the two wheels, or ‘reels’ as they are called, which hold the film
.
Now this problem was solved by two American brothers. They developed the ‘Lantham Loop’, which was the simple addition of a third reel between the two main reels, and
this took all the tension away
with the result that the film stopped snapping.
Q36    Q37
So now there was a real possibility of having films of more than two or three minutes, and this led to the making of The
Great Train Robbery
– the very first movie made. It only lasted 11 minutes but was an absolute sensation, and there were cases of people watching the movie and actually fainting when the character fired a gun at the camera! Almost overnight movies became a craze, and by 1905 people in America were lining up to see movies in ‘store theatres’, as they were called then.
Q38
I guess the next big step in terms of development of technology was to have people actually talking on the film, and the first step towards this was in 1926 when
sound effects
were first used on a film. It wasn’t until the following year however that the first ‘talkie’, as they were called then, was made. This film featured actors speaking only during parts of the film and was called The Jazz Singer, and it wasn’t until 1928 that the first all-talking film was produced, and this was called The Lights of New York. Unfortunately, the sound on this early film was not very good and I believe they put subtitles on the film – that is, they printed the dialogue along the bottom of the film to compensate for this
poor sound quality
. Now, with the addition of sound, moving pictures became far more difficult to make…
