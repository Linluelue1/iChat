剑桥雅思6 test 3 section 1听力原文与答案 opening a bank account
这篇雅思听力Section 1是到目前为止所有剑桥雅思真题系列书籍中唯一的一篇银行场景，但银行场景却是真实考试中还比较经常出现的内容，因此其中涉及到的各类账户，相关资料的词汇都需要大家掌握（

）。
易错点主要是第2题和第10题。其中第2题的月份用了数字来表达，而且语速较快，很容易反应不过来。第10题则是离第9题太近，容易错过。如果大家一直在看本系列的文章的话，应该会发现这是一种在雅思考试中十分常见的出题手段。

雅思听力
原文
PIETER:                   Good morning. I’d like to open a bank account, please.
WOMAN:                 Certainly. If you’d like to take a seat, I’ll just get some details from you. It won’t take long.
PIETER:                   Thanks.
WOMAN:                 Is it a current account or a deposit account you wanted?
PIETER:                   A
current
account.    Example
WOMAN:                 Right. I’ve got the application form here then. We have different types – I see you’ve got our leaflet there.
PIETER:                   I’ve decided on the one called ‘
Select
.’
Q1
WOMAN:                 Right, that’s fine, so, first of all, can I have your full name please?
PIETER:                   Yes, it’s Pieter Henes. That’s P-I-E-T-E-R.
WOMAN:                 Is it H-E-double N-E-S?
PIETER:                   Uh, only one N actually. It’s a less common spelling of the name.
WOMAN:                 Oh, right. OK. And what’s your date of birth please?
PIETER:
The twenty-seventh of the first, nineteen seventy-three
.
Q2
WOMAN:                 Right. And will this be a joint account?
PIETER:                   No, just myself.
WOMAN:                 OK, fine. And where are you living, Mr Henes?
PIETER:
15, Riverside
.
Q3
WOMAN:                 Is that all one word?
PIETER:                   Yes.
WOMAN:                 Exeter?
PIETER:                   Yes.
WOMAN:                 HOW long have you been at your present address? Er, is it more than two years?
PIETER:                   Ah, just
two weeks
actually. I only arrived in the country a month ago. I’m from Holland.
Q4
WOMAN:                 Oh, that’s fine. But we normally ask for a previous address in that case.
PIETER:                   Oh yes, well, it’s Rielsdorf 2. That’s R-I-E-L S-D-O-R F 2, Utrecht.
WOMAN:                 Holland. OK. Thank you. Do you have a daytime telephone number?
PIETER:                   Yes, I think the number at my office is
six oh-six-two nine-five. Um, just a minute, I’d better check. Oh, no sorry, six-one-six
. I’m not used to it yet. Would you like my home number too?
Q5
WOMAN:                 Yes please.
PIETER:                   It’s seven-nine-six four-three one.
WOMAN:                 Are they both local numbers?
PIETER:                   Yes.
WOMAN:                 Right. And your occupation?
PIETER:                   Well, I’m in Britain as a project manager, but that’s not my main job. I’m an
engineer
by profession.
Q6
WOMAN:                 I see. I think I’ll put that then. It’s shorter! Now we usually ask for a piece of information which we can use to check your identity, for security reasons. You know, if you phone us.
PIETER:                   Like, erm, my wife’s first name?
WOMAN:
Mother
‘s might be better. It’s less likely to be known.
Q7
PIETER:                   OK. Hers is Siti.
WOMAN:                 Siti?
PIETER:                   Yes, S-I-T-I. It’s Indonesian.
WOMAN:                 Fine. And how much would you like to open your account with? We usually ask for a minimum sum of ￡50. That’s about €75.
PIETER:                   Well, I’m going to transfer
€2,000
from my Dutch account, just till I get paid. In fact, I wanted to ask you about that. What’s the best way to do it?
Q8
WOMAN:                 It depends which bank you’re with.
PIETER:                   It’s the Fransen Bank in Utrecht.
WOMAN:                 OK, fine. I’ll check that in a minute. If we have links with them we can do a direct transfer. But it’s not a big problem either way. Um, let’s see. How often would you like to receive statements?
PIETER:                   I haven’t really thought. Um, what’s the usual thing?
WOMAN:                 It’s up to you. Some people like them weekly.
PIETER:                   Oh, no, that’s too often. Can I have them sent, Mm, once a
month
?
Q9
WOMAN:                 Yes, that’s fine. Is there anything else?
PIETER:                   I was thinking of registering for your
internet
service at some stage.
Q10
WOMAN:                 Oh, yes. Would you like me to send you information about that?
PIETER:                   Please, yes.
WOMAN:                 And would you like to receive information about the bank’s other services – insurance, loans, anything like that?
PIETER:                   Hmm, I don’t think so, thanks.
WOMAN:                 That’s OK then. And one last thing, if you agree…
