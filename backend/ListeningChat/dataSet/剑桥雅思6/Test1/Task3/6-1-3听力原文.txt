剑桥雅思6 test 1 section 3听力原文与答案
这篇雅思听力Section 3以填空题为主，这种情况在考试中比较少见。从过去一年的50场考试来看，只有一次考试中的Section 3出现了全部是填空的情况。但这并不意味着Section 3的填空题就很简单。相比于Section 4而言，它的节奏会快很多，题目与题目之间的间隔也很短。非常容易听到一道题之后漏了下一道，或者干脆从头到尾都没有找到地方。
具体到这道题目来说，比较容易出错的主要是第22题和第25题。两者都没有明显的提示词，而且答案读的很弱，不太容易识别。

原文
TUTOR:                   Hello, can I help you?
BRIAN:                    I was told to come here, because I’d like to talk to someone about taking a management course.
TUTOR:                   Right. I’m one of the tutors, so I should be able to help you.
BRIAN:                    Oh, good. My name’s Brian Ardley. I’ve decided to enrol on a part-time management course. A friend of mine took one last year, and recommended it to me.
TUTOR:                   Right.
BRIAN:                    Is there anything I should do before the course, like reading or anything?
TUTOR:                   We prefer to integrate reading with the course, so we don’t give out a reading list in advance. But we like people to write a case study, describing an organisation they know.
BRIAN:                    I’ve already done that, as my friends told me you wanted one. But would it be possible to
sit in on a teaching session
, to see what it’s like? I haven’t been a student for quite a while.
Q21
TUTOR:                   Fine. Just let me know which date, and I’ll arrange it with the tutor.
BRIAN:                    Now, could I ask you about the college facilities, please?
TUTOR:                   Anything in particular?
BRIAN:                    Well, the course is one day a week, all day, isn’t it? So presumably it’s possible to buy food?
TUTOR:                   Yes, the refectory’s open all day.
BRIAN:                    Does it cater for special diets? I have some food allergies.
TUTOR:                   Provided you warn the refectory
in advance
, it won’t be a problem.
Q22
BRIAN:                    Good. What about facilities for young children? I’d like to bring my daughter here while I’m studying.
TUTOR:                   How old is she?
BRIAN:                    Three.
TUTOR:                   Then she’s eligible to join the
nursery
, which is supervised by a qualified Nursery Nurse. The waiting list for a place is quite long though, so you ought to apply now.
Q23
BRIAN:                    OK.
TUTOR:                   I don’t know if our careers advice service would be of any interest to you?
BRIAN:                    Yes, it might help me decide how to develop my career after the course.
TUTOR:                   The centre has a lot of reference materials, and staff qualified to give guidance on a one-to-one basis.
BRIAN:                    I noticed a fitness centre next to the college. Is that for students?
TUTOR:                   It’s open to everyone, but students pay an
annual fee
that’s much less than the general public pay.
Q24
BRIAN:                    And presumably the college library stocks newspapers and journals, as well as books?
TUTOR:                   Yes, and there’s also an audio-visual room, for viewing and listening to videos, cassettes, and so on.
BRIAN:                    Is there also access to computers?
TUTOR:                   Yes, your
tutor
will need to arrange with the technical support team for you to get a password, so ask him or her about it when you start the course.
Q25
BRIAN:                    OK.
TUTOR:                   By the way, do you know about our Business Centre?
BRIAN:                    No. What’s that?
TUTOR:                   It’s a training resource a collection of materials for people to study on their own, or use in their own organisations.
BRIAN:                    Uhuh. You mean books and videos?
TUTOR:                   Yes, and manuals for self-study. Plus a lot of computer-based materials, so people can work through them at their own speed, and repeat anything they aren’t sure about. And you can hire
laptops
to use in your own home or workplace as well as
printers
that you can take away.
Q26/27
BRIAN:                    Does it have anything that I could use to improve my study skills? I don’t have much idea about
report writing
, and I’m sure I’ll need it on the course.
Q28
TUTOR:                   Oh yes, there’s plenty of useful material. Just ask one of the staff.
BRIAN:                    Does the centre cover all the main areas of business?
TUTOR:                   Yes, topics like finance, and of course
marketing
– that’s a popular one. Local managers seem to queue up to borrow the videos!
Q29
BRIAN:                    So it isn’t just for students, then?
TUTOR:                   No, it’s for members only, but anyone can join.
BRIAN:                    How much does it cost?
TUTOR:                   ￡100 a year for a company, and ￡50 for an
individual
, with no discount for students, I’m afraid.
Q30
BRIAN:                    That’s very helpful. Well, I think that’s all. I’d better go home and fill in the enrolment form. Thanks for all your help.
TUTOR:                   You’re welcome. Goodbye.
BRIAN:                    Goodbye.
