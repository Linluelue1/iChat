剑桥雅思6 test 4 section 1听力原文与答案
剑桥雅思6 test 4 Section 1的这篇听力介绍了一名女性咨询某个会议具体情况的情景。虽然现在考试也经常会考察与会议相关的内容，但大多数情况下都是关于会议安排的，而非参加的流程。题目上来看，这10道题目也太过简单，数字考点占比太多，几乎没有场景单词和其他内容。不过它也因此非常适合听数字能力比较差的同学练习。
易错点主要是第6题，下半段录音开始的第一句就直接说了答案，非常容易反应不过来。不过后面剑桥雅思系列书籍中就再也没有出现过类似的出法，大家可以放心。

原文
CLERK:                   Conference Centre Reservations. Good morning.
WOMAN:                 Hi. I’m interested in the computing conference next month.
CLERK:
Future Directions
in Computing?
Example
WOMAN:                 Yes, that’s right. Could I ask you a few questions about it?
CLERK:                   Of course.
WOMAN:                 OK. I know the conference is for three days but actually I want to attend on the Friday and Saturday only. Will that work out to be any cheaper?
CLERK:                   Let me have a look. Well, you could register for the two days separately, but that wouldn’t actually save you very much as it still costs ￡35 for each day. In fact, if you could register for the three days, you also get an invitation to a free dinner on the Saturday night, so that’s probably the better option.
WOMAN:                 Right, I’ll do that. How much will the fees be in that case?
CLERK:                   It’s
￡75
.
Q1
WOMAN:                 All right. I’d like to register for the full three days. Now, can I pay that by credit card?
CLERK:                   I’m afraid not. You’ll have to send a
cheque
to us, or you can pay at the conference office.
Q2
WOMAN:                 Fine. So it’s probably easiest if I pay by cheque. Now then, what else do I need to arrange? Right. How about accommodation? I guess that’s not included in the price?
CLERK:                   No, I’m sorry, it’s not, but we do have a few rooms available for delegates at the conference centre if you’d like. Those are very cheap but if you’re interested you’ll need to book soon, because there’s always a heavy demand for them. They are only
￡15
per night, but they are very basic and you’d have to get your own breakfast, because they don’t provide you with that. But it’s very convenient, because it’s in the same building as the conference rooms.
Q3
WOMAN:                 Uhuh.
CLERK:                   Or there’s a very reasonable guest house which is
￡25
per night. And I think that includes your breakfast.
Q4
WOMAN:                 Is it close to the conference centre?
CLERK:                   It would be about
a ten-minute walk away from here
.
Q5
WOMAN:                 I see. That sounds quite reasonable.
CLERK:                   The details are all in our
conference pack
, which I’ll send you.
Q6
WOMAN:                 Great, thanks. That’ll be very useful. Oh, and can you also send me an application form?
CLERK:                   Of course. I’ll get that in the post to you straight away. Is there anything else?
WOMAN:                 Yes, actually. Can you tell me where exactly the conference centre is?
CLERK:                   Well, it’s on
South
Park Road and it’s right at the end of the road next to the
library
. It’s a ten-minute taxi ride from the station and will cost you
￡5
. Otherwise, you can take the bus which runs every half an hour from the station – that’s the
21A
– and it brings you straight to the conference centre.
Q7    Q8    Q9    Q10
WOMAN:                 Right, got that.
