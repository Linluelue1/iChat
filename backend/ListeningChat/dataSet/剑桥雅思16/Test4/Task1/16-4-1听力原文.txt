原文
SHIRLEY:
Hello?
TOM:
Oh hello. I was hoping to speak to Jack Fitzgerald about renting a cottage.
SHIRLEY:
I’m his wife, Shirley, and we own the cottages together, so I’m sure I can help you.
TOM:
Great. My name’s Tom. Some friends of ours rented Granary Cottage from you last year, and they thought it was great. So my wife and I are hoping to come in May for a week.
SHIRLEY:
What date did you have in mind?
TOM:
The week beginning the 14th, if possible.
SHIRLEY:
I’ll just check… I’m sorry, Tom, it’s already booked that week. It’s free the week beginning the
28th (Q1)
, though, for seven nights. In fact, that’s the only time you could have it in May.
TOM:
Oh. Well, we could manage that, I think. We’d just need to change a couple of things. How much would it cost?
SHIRLEY:
That’s the beginning of high season, so it’d be £
550 (Q2)
for the week.
TOM:
Ah. That’s a bit more than we wanted to pay, I’m afraid. We’ve budgeted up to £500 for accommodation.
SHIRLEY:
Well, we’ve just finished converting another building into a cottage, which we’re calling
Chervil (Q3)
Cottage.
TOM:
Sorry? What was that gain?
SHIRLEY:
Chervil. C-H-E-R-V for Victor I-L.
TOM:
Oh, that’s a herb, isn’t it?
SHIRLEY:
That’s right. It grows fairly wild around here. You could have that for the week you want for £480.
TOM:
OK.So could you tell me something about it, please?
SHIRLEY:
Of course. The building was built as a
garage (Q4)
. It’s a little smaller than Granary Cottage.
TOM:
So that must sleep two people, as well?
SHIRLEY:
That’s right. There’s a double bedroom.
TOM:
Does it have a
garden (Q5)
?
SHIRLEY:
Yes, you get to it from the living room through French doors, and we provide two deckchairs. We hope to build a patio in the near future, but I wouldn’t like to guarantee it’ll be finished by May.
TOM:
OK.
SHIRLEY:
The front door opens onto the old farmyard, and
parking (Q6)
isn’t a problem – there’s plenty of room at the front for that. There are some trees and potted plants there.
TOM:
What about facilities in the cottage? It has standard things like a cooker and fridge, I presume.
SHIRLEY:
In the kitchen area there’s a fridge-freezer and we’ve just put in an electric cooker.
TOM:
Is there a washing machine?
SHIRLEY:
Yes. There’s also a TV in the living room, which plays DVDs too. The bathroom is too small for a bath, so there’s a shower instead. I think a lot of people prefer that nowadays, anyway.
TOM:
It’s more environmentally friendly, isn’t it? Unless you spend half the day in it!
SHIRLEY:
Exactly.
TOM:
What about heating? It sometimes gets quite cool at that time of year.
SHIRLEY:
There’s central heating, and if you want to light a fire, there’s a stove. We can provide all the
wood (Q7)
you need for it. It smells so much nicer than coal, and it makes the room very cosy – we’ve got one in our own house.
TOM:
That sounds very pleasant. Perhaps we should come in the winter, to make the most of it!
SHIRLEY:
Yes, we find we don’t want to go out when we’ve got the fire burning. There are some attractive views from the cottage, which I haven’t mentioned. There’s a famous stone
bridge (Q8)
– it’s one of the oldest in the region, and you can see it from the living room. It isn’t far away. The bedroom window looks in the opposite direction, and has a lovely view of the hills and the
monument (Q9)
at the top.
TOM:
Well, that all sounds perfect. I’d like to book it, please. Would you want a deposit?
SHIRLEY:
Yes, we ask for thirty percent to secure your booking, so that’ll be, um, £144.
TOM:
And when would you like the rest of the money?
SHIRLEY:
You’re coming in May, so the last day of
March (Q10)
, please.
TOM:
Fine.
SHIRLEY:
Excellent. Could I just take your details …
