剑桥雅思4 test 4 Section 4听力原文与答案 Sharks in Australia
可能是因为英国、澳大利亚、加拿大、新西兰等英联邦国家都靠海的原因，像鲨鱼这种海洋生物一直都是雅思听力Section 4（现在叫Part 4了）考察的重点。因此，剑桥雅思4 test 4的这篇听力文段还是很值得大家精听一下，总结下与鲨鱼相关的词汇的。
但该部分这10道题目的难度要明显低于正常考试。前面的填空结构太过简单，很容易让人在听之前猜到答案的大致范围；而后面的选择，无论是选项和是题干都太过简短，更加类似于Section 2的出题方式。

原文
Today we’re going to look at one of my favourite fish – the shark. As you know, sharks have a reputation for being very dangerous creatures capable of injuring or killing humans, and I’d like to talk about sharks in Australia.
Sharks are rather large fish, often growing to over ten metres and the longest sharks caught in Australia have reached sixteen metres. Sharks vary in weight with size and breed, of course, but the heaviest shark caught in Australia was a White Pointer – that,  weighed
seven hundred and ninety-five
kilograms – quite a size! Sharks have a different structure to most fish: instead of a skeleton made of bone, they have a tough elastic skeleton of cartilage. Unlike bone, this firm, pliable material is rather like your nose, and allows the shark to bend easily as it swims. The shark’s skin isn’t covered with scales, like other fish: instead the skin’s covered with barbs, giving it a rough texture like sandpaper. As you know, sharks are very quick swimmers. This is made possible by their fins, one set at the side and another set underneath the body, and the
tail
also helps the shark move forward quickly.
Q31 Q32
Unlike other fish, sharks have to keep swimming if they want to stay at a particular depth, and they rarely swim at the surface. Mostly, they swim at the bottom of the ocean, scavenging and picking up food that’s lying on the ocean
floor
While most other animals, including fish, hunt their prey by means of their eyesight, sharks hunt essentially by smell. They have a very acute
sense of smell
– and can sense the presence of food long before they can see it.
Q33 Q34
In Australia, where people spend a lot of time at the beach, the government has realised that it must prevent sharks from swimming near its beaches. As a result, they’ve introduced a beach-netting program. Beach-netting, or meshing, involves
setting large nets parallel to the shore
; this means that the nets on New South Wales beaches are set on one day, and then lifted and taken out to sea on the next day. When shark-netting first began in 1939, only the Sydney metropolitan beaches were meshed – these beaches were chosen because beaches near the city are usually the most crowded with swimmers. Ten years later, in 1949, systematic meshing was extended to include the beaches to the south of Sydney. As a result of the general success of the program in Sydney, shark-meshing was introduced to the state of Queensland around 1970. The New Zealand authorities also looked at it, but considered meshing uneconomical – as did Tahiti in the Pacific. At around the same time,
South Africa
introduced meshing to some of its most popular swimming beaches.
Q35 Q36
When meshing began, approximately fifteen hundred sharks were caught in the first year. However, this declined in the years that followed, and since that time, the average annual catch has been only about
a hundred and fifty
a year. The majority of sharks are caught
during the warmest months, from November to February
, when sharks are most active and when both the air and the ocean are at their maximum temperature.
Q37 Q38
Despite quite large catches, some people believe that shark meshing is not the best way to catch sharks. It’s not that they think sharks are afraid of nets, or because they eat holes in them, because neither of these is true. But meshing does appear to be less effective than some other methods, especially when there are big seas with
high rolling waves and strong currents
and anything that lets
the sand move
– the sand that’s holding the nets down. When this moves the nets will also become less effective.
