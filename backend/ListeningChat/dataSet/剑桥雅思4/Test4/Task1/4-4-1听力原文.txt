剑桥雅思4 test 4 Section 1听力原文与答案 goodbye party for John
这篇雅思听力Section 1的主题为告别聚会。考到了具体的地址，人员，日期，物品等细节。其中易错点有三个：第1题的college dining room答案偏长，很容易漏单词；同时dining容易双写n，造成拼写错误。第3题的students离第2题的答案太近。很多同学听到第三题的时候还在写第2题的答案，造成漏听。最后是第8题，答案之前说了一句we don’t ask them to bring more drinks。不少同学都没有识别出否定，导致将drinks当成了第8题的答案，将music当成了第9题的答案。

原文
LISA: Hi Tony, thanks ever so much for coming. You know we’ve been asked to organize something for John’s farewell?
TONY: Yeah, sure, it’s about time we started working out details.
LISA: Exactly. We don’t want to leave it so late that it’s double the work.
TONY: Mmm, mm, right, do you want me to take notes?
LISA: That’d be great, thanks.
TONY: Right, first thing is, when is the best time to hold it?
LISA: Well, he leaves on the twenty-fourth of December.
TONY: So what about the
twenty-second
?
Example
LISA: Yeah, I think that’s about right. We want it quite near the time, don’t we?
TONY: Sure, and what about a venue? In college? A hotel?
LISA: I think a hotel will probably work out rather expensive, and I’ve been looking at the
College Dining Room
; that seems pretty reasonable.
Q1
TONY: Fine, yeah, why not?
LISA: And then we ought to be thinking about invitations… Who mustn’t we forget to invite?
TONY: Well, obviously John and his wife.
LISA: Right.
TONY: And the Director.
LISA: Ah ha.
TONY: The
office staff
.
Q2
LISA: Yep, and all the teachers and all the
students
.
Q3
TONY: Anyone else?
LISA: Faculty Heads?
TONY: No, better draw the line, I don’t think it’s necessary.
LISA: Yeah, you’re right.
TONY: I don’t mind writing the invitations. When shall we get them out for?
LISA: Enough time but not too early. What about the fifteenth of
December
?
TONY: Well, there are exams on the sixteenth – better avoid them.
LISA:
Tenth
?
Q4
TONY: Yeah, that should do it.
LISA: So what does that leave? Oh yes, a present.
TONY: Would you mind doing that?
LISA: No, not at all; we usually go round with an envelope during
the coffee break
, don’t we?
Q5
TONY: Yeah, coffee break’s always the best time, ‘cos people have got their money handy.
LISA: Yeah, exactly. Do we suggest an amount? Or does it seem a bit unfair?
TONY: No, I think people welcome it. We suggested
six
dollars last time, is that OK?
Q6
LISA: Yeah, plenty I would have thought, which should leave us with about ninety dollars.
TONY: Have you any ideas for presents?
LISA: Well, I’ve been having a little think. I thought, you know, he loves music.
TONY: Yeah, and books.
LISA: So, I thought I’d check on prices for, well, perhaps CD players.
TONY: Yeah, that’s a, that’s a good idea, and also I thought maybe, you know, a
set of dictionaries
. I heard him say he needed a good one.
Q7
LISA: The other thing he was saying last week was that his computer printer had broken.
TONY: Umm. No, I’d be really frightened about getting the wrong type.
LISA: OK, yeah.
TONY: The other thing is something for the home – Jill suggested a coffee maker.
LISA: Oh yeah. I’ll certainly find out what they cost. OK, have you got all that down?
TONY: Yes.
LISA: Now we need to think a little more about the money. I know we’ve got a set amount from the Social Fund.
TONY: Right, what does that cover?
LISA: It’s meant to cover the cost of the room.
TONY: Yeah.
LISA: And a certain amount for food.
TONY: And also drinks?
LISA: Oh yeah, certainly.
TONY: But will it be enough?
LISA: What we’ve done in the past is to ask guests to bring some snacks.
TONY: Right.
LISA: We don’t ask them to bring more drinks because we figure that’s.., that should come from the Social Fund.
TONY: OK. Anything else for the guests to bring?
LISA: Well,
some music
, because there’ll be a tape deck there in the room, and we can have some dancing later on.
Q8
TONY: Anything else?
LISA: Well, it’s just a thought, but a couple of years ago we had a really good party
where we set up2 you know, some simple games.
TONY: Yeah, great. Wasn’t it based on photos from the students and teachers?
LISA: That’s right.
TONY: So we should ask the guests to bring
photos
. OK. I’ll put it on the invitations.
Q9
LISA: Now the last thing is, who shall we ask to do the
speech
?
Q10
TONY: Don’t you think it might be nice to have one of the students?
LISA: Well then, the Student Leader?
TONY: Yeah, much better than the Director giving speeches again.
LISA: OK then, I’ll ask her. Lovely! So, is that all?
TONY: Looks like it.
LISA: Great. Thanks ever so much… (fade out)
