剑桥雅思4 test 4 Section 2听力原文与答案
该部分前5道选择题的难度比较正常，出题方式和套路都比较符合目前考试的情况，但后5道填空题则过于简单了一些。10道题目中的易错点主要有两个：第15题的听力原文说的太有迷惑性，不少同学都会忽视every night前面的nearly，进而选错答案。而第17题nearest station中nearest的尾音读的太弱，很容易写成near station。

But the pride of Travelite is the level of guidance and support we offer on our walks. All are planned in detail by our highly trained guides, who all work in a variety of different Travelite locations, so we can guarantee standards. Each day we offer three separate walks
catering for all skills and fitness levels

no single client will pay more
, even when only double rooms are available for them. And the day doesn’t end with the return to base… after our dinner at communal tables designed to make all our guests feel part of a family atmosphere… Entertainment is laid on
nearly every night
