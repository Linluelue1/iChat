剑4 test 1 Section 1雅思听力原文 notes on social programme
剑桥雅思4 test 1 Section 1的这10道题目是典型的旅游场景。其内容涉及旅游的目的地，特点，费用，人数，出发时间，报名方式，日期，地点等这一场景下几乎必考的知识点。不过相对于正式考试而言，这道题目稍显简单，尤其是后面6道表格填空题，重复考察了各种地点词汇。这在真正考试中很少出现。
这部分的易错点主要有两个：其一是第二题的guided tour。一方面它在听力音频中语气较弱，很容易一不小心漏过去。另一方面，guided的尾音d和tour的头音t会发生吞音，不容易识别。其二是第4题的notice board。不少辨音基础较差的同学会写成note book。
以下是剑4 test 1 Section 1雅思听力题目对应的原文，以供大家参考：
MAN: Good morning.
WOMAN: Good morning. How can I help you?
MAN: I understand that the school organizes… umm, trips to different…
WOMAN: Yes, we run
five every month
: three during weekends and two Wednesday afternoon trips.  Example
MAN: What sort of places?
WOMAN: Well, obviously it varies, but always places of historical interest and also which offer
a variety of shopping
,
because our students always ask about that… and then we go for ones where we know there are
guided tours
,
because this gives a good focus for the visit.
Q1 Q2
MAN: Do you travel far?
WOMAN: Well, we’re lucky here, obviously, because we’re able to say that all our visits are less than three hours’ drive.
MAN: How much do they cost?
WOMAN: Again it varies – between five and fifteen pounds a head, depending on the distance.
MAN: Ah ha…
WOMAN: Oh, and we do offer to arrange special trips if, you know, there are
more than twelve
people.
Q3
MAN: Oh right, I’ll keep that in mind. And what are the times normally?
WOMAN: We try to keep it pretty fixed so that, that students get to know the pattern.  We leave at eight-thirty a.m. and return at six p.m. We figure it’s best to keep the day fairly short. MAN: Oh yes. And how do we reserve a place?
WOMAN: You sign your name on the
notice board
. Do you know where it is?
Q4
MAN: Ah ha. I saw it this morning.
WOMAN: And we do ask that you sign up three days in advance so we know we’ve got enough people interested to run it, and we can cancel if necessary, with full refund of course.
MAN: That’s fine, thanks.
MAN: And what visits are planned for this term?
WOMAN: Right, well I’m afraid the schedule hasn’t been printed out yet, but we have confirmed the dates and planned the optional extra visits which you can also book in advance if you want to.
MAN: Oh that’s all right. If you can just give some idea of the weekend ones so I can, you know, work out when to see friends, etcetera.
WOMAN: Oh sure. Well, the first one is St Ives. That’s on
the thirteenth of February
and
we’ll have only sixteen places available ‘cos we’re going by minibus. And that’s a day in town with the optional extra of visiting the Hepworth Museum.
Q5
MAN: Oh right… yeah… that sounds good.
WOMAN: Then there’s a London trip on the sixteenth of February and we’ll be taking a medium-sized coach so there’ll be forty-five places on that, and, let’s see, the optional extra is
the
Tower of London
.  Q6
MAN: Oh, I’ve already been there.
WOMAN: After that there’s
Bristol
on the third of March.
Q7
MAN: Where?
WOMAN:
Bristol… B-R-I-S-T-O-L.
MAN: OK…
WOMAN: That’s in a different minibus with eighteen places available, oh, and the optional extra is a visit to the S.S. Great Britain.
MAN: OK…
WOMAN: We’re going to Salisbury on the eighteenth of March and that’s always a popular one because the optional extra is Stonehenge, so we’re taking the large coach with fifty seats…
MAN: Oh good.
WOMAN: And then the last one is to Bath on the twenty-third of March.
MAN: Oh yes. Is Bath the Roman city?
WOMAN: Yes, that’s right, and that’s in the sixteen-seater minibus.
MAN: And where’s the optional visit?
WOMAN: It’s to the
American
Museum
–
well worth a visit.
Q8
MAN: OK, well that’s great, thanks for all that…
WOMAN: My pleasure. By the way, if you want more information about any of the trips, have a look in the
student newspaper
.  Q9
MAN: OK.
WOMAN: Or, have a word with my assistant; her name is Jane
Yentob
– that’s Y-E-N-T-O-B.
Q10
MAN: Right, I’ve got that. Thank you very much for all your help.
WOMAN: You’re very welcome. I hope you enjoy your trips.
