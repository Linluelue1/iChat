剑桥雅思4 test 1 Section 4听力原文 the urban landscape
题型上来看，剑4 test 1 Section 4的这10道题目十分符合现在Section 4以填空题为主的出题趋势。内容上来看，它介绍的城市环境规划也算是这部分比较主流的话题。
但与现在真正的考试相比，它的难度太小。这主要体现在两方面。其一，语速较慢，整体文章的题目分布十分平均，考生很难跟丢。其二，题目中的句子结构与听力原文中的句子结构基本相同。甚至空前后词都有大量相同的地方，使得定位答案毫无难度。所以如果大家这部分做的比较好，千万不要因此而骄傲自满。认为雅思听力不过如此。
以下是剑4 test 1 Section 4雅思听力题目对应的原文，以供大家参考：
Good day, ladies and gentlemen. I have been asked today to talk to you about the urban landscape. There are two major areas that I will focus on in my talk: how vegetation can have a significant effect on urban climate, and how we can better plan our
cities using trees to provide a more comfortable environment
for us to live in.
Q31
Trees can have a significant impact on our cities. They can make a city, as a whole,
a bit less
windy
or a bit more windy, if that’s what you want. They can make it a bit cooler if it’s a hot summer day in an Australian city,  they can make it
a bit more
humid
if it’s a dry inland city. On the local scale – that is, in particular areas within the city – trees can make the
local area more shady
, cooler, more humid and much less windy. In fact, trees and planting of various kinds can be used to make city streets
actually less dangerous
in particular areas. How do trees do all that, you ask?
Q32 Q33 Q34 Q35
Well, the main difference between a tree and a building is a tree has got an internal mechanism to keep the temperature regulated. It
evaporates water through its leaves
and that means that the temperature of the leaves is never very far from our own body temperature. The temperature of a building surface on a hot sunny day can easily be twenty degrees more than our temperature. Trees, on the other hand, remain cooler than buildings because they sweat. This means that they can humidify the air and cool it – a property which can be exploited to improve the local climate.
Q36
Trees can also help break the force of winds. The reason that high buildings make it windier
at ground level
is that, as the wind goes higher and higher, it goes faster and faster. When the wind hits the building, it has to go somewhere. Some of it goes over the top and some go around the sides of the building, forcing those high-level winds down to ground level. That doesn’t happen when you have trees.
Trees
filter the wind and considerably reduce it.
preventing those very large strong gusts that you so often find around tall buildings.
Q37 Q38
Another problem in built-up areas is that traffic noise is intensified by tall buildings. By planting a belt of trees at the side of the road, you can make things a little quieter, but much of the vehicle noise still goes through the trees. Trees can also help reduce the amount of noise in the surroundings, although the effect is not as large as people like to think.
Low- frequency noise
, in particular, just goes through the trees as though they aren’t there.
Q39
Although trees can significantly improve the local climate, they do however take up a lot of space. There are root systems to consider and branches blocking windows and so on. It may, therefore, be difficult to fit trees into the local landscape. There is not a great deal you can do if you have what we call a street canyon – a whole set of high-rises enclosed in a narrow street. Trees need water to grow. They also need some sunlight to grow and
you need room to put them
. If you have the chance of knocking buildings down and replacing them, then suddenly you can start looking at different ways to design the streets and to introduce… (fade out)
