剑桥雅思4 test 2 Section 1听力原文
这篇Section 1以选择和匹配为主，仅仅搭配了两道填空。这在现在的考试中还是比较少见的。从过去两年的考试情况来看，Section 1绝大多数都是填空，选择和匹配只是偶尔出现而已。
易错点主要是选择的第一题，和匹配这三道题目。其中，第一题在人称上设了个小陷阱。题目中问的是Peter，而录音中收尾的则是Sally。匹配题的难点在于整体叙述过程比较乱，如果没有守好题目中的定位点的话，很容易跟丢，进而完全不知道说到哪里了。

雅思备考听力篇 剑4 test 2 section 1 雅思听力高频词汇
以下是剑4 test 1 Section 4雅思听力题目对应的原文，以供大家参考：
SALLY: Oh, Peter, there you are. You’ve been ages. What kept you so long?
PETER: I’m sorry I’m so late, Sally. Have you been waiting long?
SALLY: Oh,
half an hour
. But it doesn’t matter. I’ve had a coffee and I’ve been reading this guidebook for tourists. Sit down. You look very hot and tired. What would you like to drink?
Example
PETER: I’d love a really
chilled mineral water
or something. Will you have another coffee?
Q1
SALLY: Yes, I will. The waitress will be back in a moment. Why were you so late? Did something happen?
PETER: Yes. You know I went to the bank to cash some travelers cheques?  Well, the exchange rate was looking healthy, but when I went to the teller, they told me the
computer system was temporarily down
, so they couldn’t do any transactions. They said the problem would be fixed in a few minutes, so I waited. And then I started talking to another guy in the bank, and I forgot the time.
Q2
SALLY: Oh, really? Someone you met in the bank? Does he work there?
PETER: NO,
he was
a tourist, from New York
. His name’s Henry, and he’s been here for a week, but he’s moving on to Germany tomorrow. He’s an architect, and he’s spending four weeks traveling around Europe.
Q3
SALLY: Just like us!
PETER: Yeah, just like us. He told me the names of some places where we should eat. Great food, and not too expensive, he said. Oh, and he also gave me
this map of the bus system
. He said he didn’t need it anymore.
Q4
SALLY: That’s useful. Pity he’s moving on tomorrow. Ah, here’s the waitress. Let’s order. Do you want anything to eat, or shall we just have a drink?
PETER: Well, I’m hungry, and we’ve got a lot of sightseeing to do, so let’s just have
a snack and a drink
.
Q5
SALLY: Sounds good to me!
PETER: Well, let’s decide what we’ll see today. I guess the best place to start is the Cathedral, and then the Castle. What are the opening times for those two?
SALLY: Well, according to this guidebook, the Cathedral is only open from nine-thirty in the morning until midday. No, hang on. That’s the Cathedral Museum.
The
Cathedral itself is open morning and afternoon
. The Castle is just open from one to five, so we can’t go there until after lunch. I really want to spend some time in the Art Gallery, because they’ve got this wonderful painting by Rembrandt that I’ve always wanted to see.
Q6
PETER: What else should we see?
SALLY: Well, the guidebook says the Botanical Gardens are worth spending some time in, and they’re open all day, from eight to six, so we can go there any time. I’d like to go to the Markets near the river too, but… oh… no, wait, that’s only in the mornings, too.
PETER: AS well as today and tomorrow, we can see some other places on Monday, you know.
But
I don’t think the Markets will be open then
; they only open on Thursdays, so we’ve missed them for this week. Maybe we should go to the Cathedral today because it’s Sunday tomorrow, and even though it’s open every day it might be more difficult to get in tomorrow because of the church services.
Q7
SALLY: That’s true, but the Art Gallery isn’t open on Sundays at all, so we’ll have to go there today. The Castle’s open every day except Mondays, so we’re OK there, and the Gardens of course only close at night.
PETER: Are all these places free or do we have to pay to go in? What does the guidebook say?
SALLY: I think there’s
a charge for all of them except the Botanical Gardens
. Oh, and the Markets, of course, you don’t pay to go in.
Q8
PETER: OK, well, it looks like our plan is this:
we’ll go to see the painting you like first
, the Rembrandt, then have lunch and go on to the Castle after that, and then the Cathedral.
Q9
SALLY: OK. It says here that the roof of the Cathedral is really beautiful.
PETER: IS that right? What I really want to do at the Cathedral is
climb the tower.
The view is supposed to be spectacular.
Q10
SALLY: OK, well, that’ll be more than enough for today. Then, tomorrow, let’s go to the Botanical Gardens and have a picnic. I want to sit by the river and watch the swans. This city’s famous for them.
