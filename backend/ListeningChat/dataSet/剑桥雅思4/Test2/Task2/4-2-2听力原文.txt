剑桥雅思4 test 2 Section 2听力原文与答案
该部分由10道单项选择题构成，这种情况在现在考试中虽然也会出现，但概率并不算大。难度上来讲，它比真实考试要难一些，一方面是选项偏长，另一方面是干扰项藏的比较隐蔽。其易错点主要有三个：
第12题，unfamiliar在听力原文中读的太过明显，十分具有迷惑性，进而忽视了题目中问的是导致压力的原因是什么。
第15题，与第12题相似，C选项their family puts too much pressure on them与听力原文太过相似，很容易让人忽视后面的内容而直接选择。
第20题，本身难度不大，但与第19题十分接近，很容易听完19题之后稍不留声就漏过去。

剑桥雅思4 Test 2听力Section 2答案解析
剑4 test 2 Section 2雅思听力原文：
So the counseling services we offer deal with any problems arising from your studies, or in your life outside the university. Let’s take academic counseling. If you’re confused about subjects or how to combine them in your degree, then we can advise you and discuss the career you are aiming for, so that you can see it all in context.
We can also chase up your tutor if you’re not getting proper feedback on how you are getting on in your subject.
Q11
Besides help with academic problems, you may also need personal counseling: if you think you’re already under stress, well, just wait till classes begin next week.  You’ll have to start adjusting to teaching and learning methods that may be unfamiliar to you, as well as the
mounting pressure as the
deadline for that first assignment creeps up on you
.
And of course, you have to cope with all this without your usual social network – you know, the social contacts. family and friends,
you could normally rely on for help
. All of this causes anxiety. . Studying overseas can trigger a personal crisis – you may have left a lot of what you might call ‘unfinished business’ back in your own country, or you may have
interrupted personal relationships
or even sometimes have broken them off to come overseas, and so the student often feels lonely, unhappy, unmotivated and unable to concentrate on studying. Or there may be other things bothering you. Our resident chaplain can offer you spiritual guidance if that’s what you want, or we can put you in touch with community groups that can provide you with social contacts and friendship.
Q12 Q13 Q14
What about exam stress? It affects nearly everyone to some extent, but especially overseas students like yourselves. There may be a huge amount of family pressure on you to succeed, and
if you fail a subject or drop out of a course because it’s too difficult then your self-esteem can suffer.
But it’s not the end of the world if you don’t pass an exam – I had to resit First Year Anthropology, so I can certainly offer you a sympathetic ear! Anyway, exam failure can lead to worrying changes in the way you normally behave. You may also be off your food, or you may have dietary problems because
the local food is not to your liking
and upsets you, and this can affect your health and studies. Glenda Roberts is our dietician in the Health Service and we can put you on to her.
Q15 Q16
And we all have money problems, don’t we? But remember, full-time students can get a
l
ow-interest loan of up to six hundred dollars to buy books
and for similar study-related expenses. That’s right, and you can get double that amount if you can’t afford an item of equipment you need for your course – a musical instrument, for example. And it doesn’t stop there.
When you move into a flat, starting-up expense, including furniture for it
, can be covered by a loan through the Welfare Service – see Jill Freeman for details.
Q17 Q18
Can we help you? Well, last academic year, in spite of staff cuts,
we counseled two hundred and forty international students
for a total of twenty-six hundred hours counseling, and, finally we won all but just one of the twelve appeals that we launched on behalf of students.
Not too bad for an understaffed service
, don’t you think? That’s all from me. Thank you.
