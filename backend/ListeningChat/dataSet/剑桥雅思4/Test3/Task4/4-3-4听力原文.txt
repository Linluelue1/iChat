剑桥雅思4 test 3 Section 4听力原文与答案
这篇雅思听力Section 4的主题为学校里新的学生会建筑。题型包括单句填空、表格填空、单选和多选，比较复杂。虽然现在考试Section 4中也会出现单选和多选，但一般题型只有两种，而且提纲型填空才是主流题型。除此之外，该部分中的多选也跟目前考试不太一样。现在考试中多选多为两个题号，代表两个独立的题目，答对一个就有一份。而不是像这道题一样，必须两个选项都选对才有分数（

原文
We’re very grateful that the Committee has agreed that a representative for the Students’ Union can present students’ suggestions about the design for the proposed new Union building. We appreciate that some of our ideas may not be feasible in the circumstances, but we do feel that it is important that the ultimate beneficiaries of the facilities should have some say in its design.
If I could start by briefly explaining what steps were taken to find out student opinion and how we have arrived at conclusions. Firstly, a meeting was held in the current Union for our SU Committee to explain the options. Then we invited all students to submit written suggestions for the design, placing cards in a suggestion box. These suggestions then provided the basis for the design of a
questionnaire
,  which was completed by
approximately two thousand
of the College students over a period of three weeks. Finally, the SU Committee collated the results and drew up a report. If I can just hand around a copy of that report. This presentation is essentially a summary and discussion of the key points of this report.
Q31, Q32
So, in broad terms, the consensus was as follows. Firstly, regarding the crucial matter of the site, we presented the three options that you have proposed. One: in the city center, near the Faculty of
Education
: two: on the outskirts of the city, near the park, and three: out of town, near the
halls of residence
. We asked students to cite reasons for and against these sites and, and there was remarkable agreement on all three. Site One was unpopular
because of traffic and parking problems
. Site Two had a number of supporters, mainly because it was close to
most lecture rooms
. And Site Three, out of town, near the halls of residence, was clearly the most popular because of access from living quarters. It was clear that the Union was mainly to be used after lectures. It was also felt that the larger site would allow
more room for a choice of facilities
.
Q33 Q34 Q35 Q36 Q37
Our second area of interest was obviously the facilities: there was minimal interest in having a library on the premises, but one option seemed to be a reading room instead -more useful. We would like the current table games room to be replaced with
a small gym
. And, if possible, a small swimming pool – not, of course, Olympic-sized! There was a large number of respondents in favor of
a travel agent’s
and insurance center. We also request that there be the offices of the Student Counselling Centre, moving this from the Refectory. There was, however, much disagreement about whether to build a drama theatre. Just over forty percent of the respondents were in favor, but a largish minority were strongly against it, claiming that it is
elitist and a waste of funds
. Essentially the jury is out on that.
Q38 Q39
Finally, given the number of unfortunate incidents in the current Union over the past few months, a strong point was repeatedly made about security. The recommendations would be at least
video surveillance
and security personnel who would
check Student Union cards on request
. We doubt if it would be feasible to have a check at the reception of all people coming in.
Q40
Well, this is the summary of the views of the student population. As I say, fuller details are given in our report but I’m happy to take any questions if you have them… (fade out)
