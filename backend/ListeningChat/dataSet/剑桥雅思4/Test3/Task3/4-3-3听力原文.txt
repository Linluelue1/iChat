剑桥雅思4 test 3 Section 3听力原文与答案
这篇Section 3由10道选择题构成，不过难度都不算太大。无论是题干还是选项都比较短，读题时间充足。干扰项设置的也十分简单，跟现在考试Section 3的难度完全不在一个层级。
易错点主要有三个。22题，28题，和30题。其中，22题的同义替换比较出人意料，直接给出两个日期作为两天的替换内容，很多同学一时反应不过来。28题的难点主要在于听力原文中使用了consecutive（连续的）一词，不少同学都不认识，最后只能根据听到的Monday随便选一个。30题与29题的距离太近，很容易漏过去。但只要及时关注了，本身的难度并不算大。

原文
OFFICER: Hello. Er, I’m Dawn Matthews.
STUDENT: Yes, hello. I’ve been referred to you because I’m enquiring about the refresher courses that you run. I’d like to find out a bit more about them.
OFFICER: OK. Well, we run quite a few different short courses for students who are either
returning to study
or studying part-time. Um, tell me about your situation.
Q21
STUDENT: Well, I think that I really need some help in preparing for the coming semester, especially to build up my confidence a bit and help me study effectively because, you see, I’ve been out in the work-force for nearly twelve years now, so it really is a long time since I was last a student.
OFFICER: Yes, it can seem like a long time, can’t it? Um, well, let me start by telling you what courses we have that might suit you. Are you an undergraduate or a postgraduate? Arts or Sciences?
STUDENT: Undergraduate, and I’m in the Business faculty.
OFFICER: Right then. First of all, there’s our intensive ‘Study for Success’ seminar on
the first and second of February
. It’s aimed at students like you who are uncertain about what to expect at college, and looks at a fairly wide range of approaches to university learning, to motivate you to begin your study and build on your own learning strategies.
Q22
STUDENT: Mm, that sounds good. What are some of the strategies that are presented?
OFFICER: Well, we try to cover all aspects of the study. Some of the strategies in writing, for example, would be improving your planning for writing, organizing your thinking and building some techniques to help you
write more clearly
. With reading, there’ll be sessions aimed at getting into the habit of
analyzing material
as you read it, and tips to help you record and remember what you have read. It really is very important to begin reading confidently right from the beginning.
Q23 Q24
STUDENT: Mm.
OFFICER: There’s also advice on how to get the most from your lectures and practice in giving confident presentations, as well as how to prepare for exams.
STUDENT: What about the motivational side of things?
OFFICER: Ah. Well, there’s a range of motivational exercises that we do to help the students feel
positive and enthusiastic about their studies
. The process of learning and exploring a subject can lead to a whole new way of looking at the world, and the study skills and techniques that you build up can be applied in all sorts of different ways.
Q25
STUDENT: Actually, I… I’m very excited about the whole thing of taking up studying again but, you know, I’m a little nervous about whether I’ll manage to get everything done. I suppose it’s the same for all mature students?
OFFICER: Of course it is. Two of the key components of the course are
time management
and overcoming procrastination. People discover that, once they learn to plan their days, all the work can be accomplished and there’ll still be time for leisure.
Q26
STUDENT: IS there an enrolment fee?
OFFICER: Well, er, oh, just a minute, let’s see… Ah, the cost is thirty pounds, which includes all course materials and morning tea. You have to arrange your own lunch.
STUDENT: That wouldn’t be a problem. I already make sandwiches for my three kids and my wife and myself every day. I won’t have to change my routine.
OFFICER: No. Now, I need to tell you that this is a very popular course and it’s essential that you
book well ahead of time
. In fact, the Course Convenor tells me that there are only five places left.
Q27
STUDENT: What other courses might be good for me?
OFFICER: There is one other that you could benefit from. It’s simply called ‘Learning Skills for University Study’ and is
on three consecutive mornings starting on a Monday
, from nine to twelve, and costs twenty-five pounds. This is aimed at upgrading the study skills most school-leavers have and help them cope with the increased demands of university study. It focuses mainly on making students more responsible for their own success.
Q28
STUDENT: What sort of things are covered in this course?
OFFICER: Well, basically it’s more advanced thinking, note-taking, reading and writing strategies, but also some input about
stress management
.
Q29
STUDENT: I think I’d be better off
starting from the basics
and looking at all the strategies, don’t you?
Q30
OFFICER: Yes, from what you’ve told me, I think that’s more in line with your situation.
STUDENT: Alright then, um, can I book a place on the ‘Study for Success’ seminar course now?
OFFICER: Yes. Let me just get out a registration form and take down your details.
