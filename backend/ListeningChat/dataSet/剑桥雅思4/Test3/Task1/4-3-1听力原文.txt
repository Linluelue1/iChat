剑桥雅思4 test 3 Section 1听力原文与答案 accommodation request form
这10道题目是在真正考试中十分常见的住宿场景。里面提到了跟谁住，具体的住宿类型，相关费用等问题。词汇的难度倒是不大，大家的练习重点可以放在熟悉相关问题和回答上。
其中的易错点主要有两个。一是第一道题的1.5 years，需要大家自己将这名女生在澳大利亚的两段经历加起来，比较麻烦一些。不过可以放心的是，这种需要我们自己计算的题目在最近7,8年都没有出现过了。二是第10题的phone。这个单词的发音有些奇怪，不少同学听得都是fine，需要额外注意一下。

原文
LYNDA: Sara, I’ve heard that you want to move into a homestay family. Is that correct?
SARA: Yes, that’s right. I’ve been staying with my aunt and now my cousin is arriving from Singapore and my aunt needs the room for him.
LYNDA: Oh, that’s bad luck. Well, I’ll need to get some particulars first. Sara, what’s your full name?
SARA:
Sara Lim
, and that’s Sara without the ‘h’ at the end.
Example
LYNDA: Mmm. How old are you, Sara?
SARA: Twenty-three, only just. It was my birthday on the twenty-first of August.
LYNDA: Happy birthday for yesterday. How long have you been in Australia?
SARA:
A year in Adelaide and six months in Sydney
. I prefer Sydney, I’ve got more friends here.
Q1
LYNDA: What’s your address at your aunt’s house?
SARA: Flat one, five three nine
Forest
Road, Canterbury. And the postcode is two, o, three, six.
Q2
LYNDA: OK. What are you studying now?
SARA: I was studying General English in Adelaide and now I’m doing
Academic
English, because I’m trying to get into Medicine next year.
Q3
LYNDA: That sounds good, but it’ll take you a long time. When would you like to move out from your aunt’s?
SARA: My cousin arrives on Friday morning, so I’d better be out on
Thursday
.
Q4
LYNDA: What, the seventh of September?
SARA: Yes, that’s right.
LYNDA: That doesn’t leave us much time. Right, OK. I need to know what kind of accommodation you’d like, so I can get you something suitable.
SARA: Can I
share a room
with someone else? I’ve been alone in my room at my aunt’s and I’ve always shared with my sister and I like that.
Q5
LYNDA: Yes, fine. That’ll save you money too. Would you like to live with a family or do you think that a
single person
would be better for you? I have lots of very nice single people on my books.
Q6
SARA: DO you have any women living alone, retired women?
LYNDA: Yes, I have quite a few whose children have grown up and left home. In fact, I have some really lovely retired ladies, living by themselves, who just love the company of students. Most of them live in
flats
, but that’s not a problem for you, is it?
Q7
SARA: Not at all. I’m used to that. My aunt lives in a flat too, remember. I’m not used to a big house with a garden, swimming pool, pets and all that.
LYNDA: OK, fine. I know quite a bit about what you want now. I should let you know that your rent will be a hundred and sixty dollars per week. You’ll have to pay me three hundred and twenty dollars as a
deposit
before you move in. The deposit is as insurance, in case you break something. You’ll need to pay
monthly
to me, by cash or cheque, I don’t mind. You don’t need to pay for gas, electricity or water, but you will need to pay your proportion of the
phone
bill. Most families do that on an honor system, but you’ll have to wait and see.
Q8 Q9 Q10
SARA: Mmm.
LYNDA: Have you got any more questions for me?
SARA: When will you know where I can go?
LYNDA: I’ll work on it now, so come and see me tomorrow and I should have some news for you then.
SARA: Thanks a lot.
IYNDA: Goodbye. See you tomorrow – after lunch would be better for me.
SARA: OK, see you then. Bye.
