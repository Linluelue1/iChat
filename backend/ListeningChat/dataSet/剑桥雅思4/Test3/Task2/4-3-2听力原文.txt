剑桥雅思4 test 3 Section 2听力原文与答案
该部分介绍了某地区的节日以及在此期间三个马戏团表演的情况，属于雅思听力Section 2十分典型的场景。大家在听完之后可以积累下其中出现的各种词汇。
10道题目中易错点主要有三个。其一为第12题。一方面它跟第11题的距离很近，容易听漏；另一方面，这道题采用的theater和theatrical的同义替换比较少见，很多同学反应不过来。第二个易错点是第15题，lighting这个词发生了变音，听起来有些像lighding，很容易写错。第三个易错点是第18题。这道题前面有大段的叙述，其中提到the performers are so young，导致一些同学将young当成了答案。但实际上题目问的是观众类型，还要再往后等一点。

原文
GEOFFREY: Good evening, and in this week’s edition of ‘Focus on the Arts’, Jane Hemmington is going to fill us in on what’s in store for us at this year’s Summer Festival. Over to you, Jane.
JANE: Thank you, Geoffrey. This year, the Summer Festival is the biggest we’ve ever seen, so there should be something for everybody. This is the third year they’ve run it and the timing’s slightly different: for the last couple of years it’s been around the fifth to seventeenth, but this year they wanted to allow everyone enough time to recover from the first of January celebrations and they’ve put it
at the end of the month
.
Q11
The program has a sensational theatre, dance and also a large number of art exhibitions, but the thing the Festival is most famous for is its great street music.  For today’s report though, Geoffrey, I’m looking at some of the
theatrical events
that you might like to see; in particular, at this year’s theme – circuses.
Q12
I’m going to tell you about two circus performances, but there are
plenty of others in the program
. I’ve chosen these because they represent distinct movements within circus performance. The first is the Circus Romano from Italy. As this is a traveling circus, it follows a long tradition by performing
in a marquee
– which is really like a canvas portable building, usually put up in a green space or car park, rather than in a theatre or stadium.
Q13 Q14
In spite of this, Circus Romano isn’t at all like the traditional circuses I grew up with. There are no animals -just very talented clowning and acrobatic routines. The show has a lot of very funny moments, especially at the beginning, but the best part is
the music and
lighting
. They’re magical. At forty-five dollars it’s very expensive anyway – it’s really for
adult
tastes. In fact, much of it would be wasted on children – so I suggest you leave them at home.
Q15 Q16
The second circus performance is Circus Electrica at the
Studio Theatre
. The purists are suggesting that this isn’t a circus at all. It’s a showcase for skills in dance and magic, rather than the usual ones you expect in a circus. With only six performers it’s a small production, which suits the venue well -the Studio only seats about two hundred people. For my money, it’s the aerial displays which are outstanding as well as the magical tricks – features which are missing from Circus Romano. An interesting feature of the show is that the performers are so young – the youngest is only fourteen. But it’s still well worth seeing: a good one for
the whole family
.
Q17 Q18
And finally, as it’s summer, you may wish to see some of the Festival performances that are being presented outdoors. Like the famous Mekong Water Puppet Troupe, performing in
the City Gardens
this week. Now, water puppetry is amazing! It’s large puppets on long sticks, controlled by puppeteers standing waist-deep in the lake. The puppets do comedy routines and there is some terrific formation dancing. This is a fantastic show and the best moment comes at the end – seeing the puppeteers. When the troupe walks up out of the water, you get this amazing feeling. It’s really hard to believe that what you’ve been watching is lifeless wood and cloth. As an adult, I had a great time, but I did note that other older people in the audience weren’t quite as taken with it as I was. It’s a must for
young children
though, and that’s the audience it’s really aimed at.
Q19 Q20
Well, that’s all I’ve time for today, but I’ll be back next week with more news of what’s worth seeing and what it’s best to miss.
