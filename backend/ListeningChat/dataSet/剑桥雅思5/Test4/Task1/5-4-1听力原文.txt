剑桥雅思5 test 4 section 1听力原文与答案 host family applicant
这篇Section 1的听力题目非常典型，不仅内容是雅思听力中十分喜爱的租房场景（
雅思备考听力篇 剑5 test 4 section 1 雅思听力高频词汇
），而且出题方式上也基本涵盖了Section 1所有的干扰项类型。大家做完之后一定要记着多琢磨琢磨，然后再做做
精听
，以便将题目的作用最大化。
易错点主要是第3题。虽然录音中女生明显是想要强调她只能在这里待4个月，但题目问的是intended，也就是想要待多久。这点跟原文中的plan对应，因此确定答案是1 year。这道题也最好地说明了雅思听力的出题方式其实更加注重题目，而非原文的特点。

雅思听力
原文
ADVISER: Good morning, how can I help you?
STUDENT: Good morning. Umm, I understand you help fix up students with host families.
ADVISER: That’s right… are you interested in…?
STUDENT: Yes…
ADVISER: Well please sit down and I’ll just take a few details.
STUDENT: Thank you.
ADVISER: Right now… what name is it?
STUDENT: Jenny Chan.
ADVISER: Can you spell that please?
STUDENT: Yes…
J-E-N-N-Y C-H-A-N
.
Example
ADVISER: Right… and what is your present address?
STUDENT: Sea View Guest House,
14 Hill Road
.
Q1
ADVISER: OK, and do you know the phone number there?
STUDENT: Yes… I have it here, ummm… 2237676, but I’m only there after about 7 pm.
ADVISER: So when would be the best time to catch you?
STUDENT: I suppose
between 9 and, let me see, half-past
, before I leave for the college.
Q2
ADVISER: Great… and can I ask you your age?
STUDENT: I’ve just had my nineteenth birthday.
ADVISER: And how long would you want to stay with the host family?
STUDENT: I’m planning on staying
a year
but at the moment I’m definitely here for four months only. I have to get an extension to my permit.
Q3
ADVISER: You’re working on it? Fine… and what will be your occupation while you’re in the UK?
STUDENT: Studying English?
ADVISER: And what would you say your level of English is?
STUDENT: Umm. Good, I think I’d like to say ‘advanced’ but my written work is below the level of my spoken, so I suppose it’s
intermediate
.
Q4
ADVISER: Certainly your spoken English is advanced. Anyway, which area do you think you would prefer?
STUDENT: Ummm, well I’m studying right in the centre but I’d really like to live in the
north-west
.
Q5
ADVISER: That shouldn’t be a great problem… we usually have lots of families up there.
ADVISER: And do you have any particular requirements for diet?
STUDENT: Well, I’m nearly a
vegetarian
… not quite.
Q6
ADVISER: Shall I say you are? It’s probably easier that way.
STUDENT: That would be best.
ADVISER: Anything about your actual room?
STUDENT: I would prefer my own facilities – ‘en suite’, is that right? And also if it’s possible a TV and I’d also like the house to have a real
garden
rather than just a yard, somewhere I could sit and be peaceful.
Q7
ADVISER: Is that all?
STUDENT: Well… I’m really serious about improving my English so I’d prefer to be
the only guest
if that’s possible?
Q8
ADVISER: No other guests… Yes, you get more practice that way. Anyway, obviously all this is partly dependent on how much you’re willing to pay. What did you have in mind?
STUDENT: I was thinking in terms of about ￡60-￡80 a week, but I’d go up to
a hundred
if it was something special.
Q9
ADVISER: Well I don’t think we’d have any problems finding something for you.
STUDENT: Oh, good.
ADVISER: And when would you want it for?
STUDENT: I’d like to move in approximately two weeks.
ADVISER: Let me see, it’s the 10th today… so if we go for the
Monday
it’s the
23rd March
.
Q10
STUDENT: Yes.
ADVISER: Right… good, and if I could ask one last question…
