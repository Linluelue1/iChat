剑桥雅思5 test 4 Section 2听力原文与答案
这篇雅思听力Section 2是比较典型的组织介绍场景，也是现在雅思听力比较喜欢考察的四大场景之一。不过题型上出现了大量的表格，而表格现在已经失去了剑桥雅思考试委员会的宠爱，在最近几年出现的频率不高。
容易出错的地方主要是第12题和第19题。前者的同义替换比较隐蔽，用begin with代替first，而且离上一道题目很近，非常容易漏过去。后者则是单纯的单词问题，不少同学不太清楚newsletter（简讯，内部通讯）是什么意思，犹犹豫豫没敢写，最后只能空着。

原文
Good evening everyone and thank you for coming to the Soccer Club meeting. It’s good to see so many parents and children here tonight, and I know you are looking forward to a great football season. Now I’d like to take a few minutes to tell you about some changes to the Soccer Club for the coming season.
Now, this season we’ll be playing all our matches for both the junior and senior competitions at King’s Park, instead of Royal Park, which was used last season.
Now for meetings, we’re going to use the
clubhouse
in King’s Park, and the next meeting will be held in the clubhouse on the 2nd of July.
Q11
As usual, we hope to begin the season with a
picnic
next Saturday at the clubhouse. Please try and come to the picnic as it’s always good fun. The last week of the season we usually have a dinner and presentation of
prizes
to the players, and more information about this will be given to you later in the season.
Q12, Q13
This season we have more teams than ever. We hope to have
ten
teams, instead of five, in the junior competition and they will play on Saturday mornings, beginning at 8.30 a. m. Training sessions will be held in King’s Park on
Wednesday afternoons
for the juniors and they will be wearing red shirts again this year.
Q14, Q15
In the senior competition, there’ll be
four
teams, the same as last year, and their games will be played on Saturday afternoons starting at 2.30, no sorry, it will be a 2 o’clock start, and the training session for seniors is planned for
Sunday afternoons
.
Q16, Q17
Now I’d like to introduce you to the new committee for the Soccer Club for this season. Firstly, let me welcome Robert Young, the new President, who will manage the meetings for the next two years. Robert’s son has been playing football with the club for over five years now, and many thanks to Robert for taking on the job of President.
Next we have Gina Costello, she’s the treasurer, and she will
collect the fees
from you for the season. Please try and give Gina your fees as early as possible in the season, as the club needs the money to buy some new equipment.
Q18
Then there’s David West who has volunteered to be the club secretary, and one of the many jobs he will have is to
send out newsletters
to you regularly. If you have any information that may be useful, please let David know so that it can be included in these newsletters.
Q19
Also I’d like to introduce you to Jason Dokic who is the Head Coach. For all the new members here tonight, this is the third year that Jason has been with us as Head Coach, and we are very lucky to have such an experienced coach and former player at our club. He will continue to
supervise the teams
, at training sessions and on match days.
Q20
Now before we finish and have some refreshments, does anyone have any questions they’d like to ask the new committee?
