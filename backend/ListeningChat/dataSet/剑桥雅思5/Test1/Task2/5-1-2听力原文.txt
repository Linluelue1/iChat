剑桥雅思5 test 1 Section 2听力原文与答案
虽然现在考试Section 2仍然会出现填空，但一方面出现的概率比较小，另一方面哪怕出现了也只是作为点缀。很少像剑桥雅思5 test 1 Section 2这样10道题目全都是填空。但这篇文章录音的内容还是比较符合现在考试的情况的，大家做完题目之后可以做下精听。
该部分的易错点有两个，一是第12题和第13题之间间隔太短，很容易听到12之后漏了13，二是第20题的sharp藏的比较隐蔽，听力原文中的句子结构与题干的句子结构完全不同，十分容易忽略。

原文
Hello and welcome to today’s ‘Buyer Beware’ program, where we give you some tips on how to spend your money wisely. Now, in today’s show we’re looking at beds for children and babies. Let’s start by looking at baby cots, that’s for children of up to three years old. We tested three different cots all in the budget price range and, as usual, we will feature the good points, the problems and our verdict.
The first cot we looked at was by Baby Safe and it had several good points to recommend it. Our testers liked the fact that it had four wheels, so it was easy to
move around
. The only slight problems with this cot were that it had no
brakes
, but they didn’t think that mattered too much. At first, they were a bit concerned about the sidebar, because they felt babies could trap their
fingers
in it, but our testers felt that this was unlikely to happen so they have given this one a verdict of ‘
satisfactory
’.
Q11, Q12, Q13, Q14
The next cot was by Choice Cots and this time our testers were pleased to find a cot which is simple to
put together
– unlike others we looked at. On the minus side, our testers did not like the fact that the side of the cot did not drop down, making it difficult to pick up newborn babies. However, the real problem with this cot was the space between the bars; our testers found they were
too wide
and a baby could easily trap his head. We felt this was a real safety hazard and so we have labeled this one
dangerous
, I’m afraid.
Q15, Q16, Q17
And finally better news for the Mother’s Choice cot. This cot was slightly different in that, although the sidebar did not drop down, the base could be raised or lowered into two different positions making it safe as well as convenient. The negatives for this one were quite minor; the only niggle everyone had was the fact that it has no
wheels
and the only other problem anyone could find, was that there were pictures which were simply stuck on and so could easily become detached. The makers have now promised to discontinue this practice. As this cot will then be safe in every way, we have made the Mother’s Choice cot our
best buy
. Congratulations Mother’s Choice!
Q18, Q19
So, what features should you look for in a baby’s cot? Well, obviously safety is a very important factor as well as comfort and convenience. We recommend that, if you are buying a cot, do make sure that any metal present is not rusted or bent in any way. You should ensure your cot has only rounded or smooth edging without any
sharp
edges, this is especially important for wooden cots.
