剑桥雅思5 test 3 section 4听力原文与答案 household waste recycling
这篇Section 4虽然由10道填空题构成，但并不是现在比较流行的提纲型填空题，而是单句填空和表格填空。相比较而言，后两者的难度要大于前者，尤其是在定位句子方面。单句填空和表格填空因为没有太过明显的定位词，很容易漏掉。
该部分的易错点主要是32题和36题。前者主要难在incineration的拼写上。而后者则由不少同学把roads听成了rose。

原文
STUDENT: Well, my group has been doing a project on how household waste is recycled in Britain.
We were quite shocked to discover that only 9% of people here in the UK make an effort to recycle their household waste. This is a lower figure than in most other European countries, and needs to increase dramatically in the next few years if the government is going to meet its recycling targets.
The agreed targets for the UK mean that by 2008 we must reduce our carbon dioxide emissions by
12.5%
, compared with 1990. And recycling can help to achieve that goal, in two main ways: the production of recycled glass and paper uses much less energy than producing them from virgin materials, and also recycling reduces greenhouse gas emissions from landfill sites and
incineration plants
.
Q31/Q32
As part of our project, we carried out a survey of people in the street, and the thing that came up over and over again is that people don’t think it’s easy enough to recycle their waste. One problem is that there aren’t enough ‘
drop-off
’ sites, that is, the places where the public are supposed to take their waste.
Q33
We also discovered that waste that’s collected from householders is taken to places called ‘bring banks’, for sorting and baling into loads. One problem here is taking out everything that shouldn’t have been placed in the recycling containers: people put all sorts of things into bottle banks, like plastic bags and even broken umbrellas. All this has to be removed by hand. Another difficulty is that toughened glass used for
cooking
doesn’t fully melt at the temperature required for other glass, and so that also has to be picked out by hand.
Q34
Glass is easy to recycle because it can be reused over and over again without becoming weaker. Two million tons of glass is thrown away each year, that is, seven billion bottles and jars; but only
500,000
tons of that is collected and recycled.
Q35
Oddly enough, half the glass that’s collected is green, and a lot of that is imported, so more green glass is recycled than the UK needs. As a result, new uses are being developed for recycled glass, particularly green glass, for example in fibreglass manufacture and water filtration. A company called CLF Aggregates makes a product for
roads
, and 30% of the material is crushed glass.
Q36
For recycling paper, Britain comes second in Europe with 40%, behind Germany’s amazing 70%.
When recycling started, there were quality problems, so it was difficult to use recycled paper in office printers. But these problems have now been solved, and Martin’s, based in South London, produces a range of office stationery which is 100% recycled, costs the same as normal paper and is of equally high quality.
But this high quality comes at a cost in terms of the waste produced during the process. Over a third of the waste paper that comes in can’t be used in the recycled paper, leaving the question of what to do with it. One firm, Papersave, currently sells this to farmers as a
soil conditioner
, though this practice will soon be banned because of transport costs and the smell, and the company is looking into the possibility of alternative uses.
Q37
Plastic causes problems, because there are so many different types of plastic in use today, and each one has to be dealt with differently. Pacrite recycles all sorts of things, from bottles to car bumpers, and one of its most successful activities is recycling plastic bottles to make
containers
which are used all over the country to collect waste.
Q38
The Save-a-Cup scheme was set up by the vending and plastics industries to recycle as many as possible of the three-and-a-half billion polystyrene cups used each year. At the moment 500 million polycups are collected, processed and sold on to other businesses, such as Waterford, which turns the cups into
pencils
, and Johnson & Jones, a Welsh-based firm, which has developed a wide variety of items, including
business cards
.
Q39, Q40
Well, to sum up, there seems to be plenty of research going on into how to re-use materials, but the biggest problem is getting people to think about recycling instead of throwing things away. At least doing the research made us much more careful.
