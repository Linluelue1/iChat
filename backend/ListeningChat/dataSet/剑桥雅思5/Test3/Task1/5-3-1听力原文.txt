剑桥雅思5 test 3 Section 1听力原文与答案 Mintons Car Mart
这篇雅思听力讲述了顾客买车咨询的过程。这一场景虽然不像求职、租房那么热门，但时不时也会出现一次，大家还是需要注意一下，尤其是那些跟汽车有关的词汇。此外还需要说明的是第1题的答案。很多同学可能都没有带后面litres的单位，导致出错。但是现在雅思考试题目一般都会自带单位，所以不用太过担心。
易错点主要是第2题，第5题和第6题。第2题是单纯的拼写，本身不难；第5题主要是double和r的连读，导致很多同学反应不过来，积累下读音就好；第6题则是离第5题太近，很容易漏掉。

原文
MAN: Good morning, please take a seat. How can I help you?
WOMAN: Well, I’m thinking of buying a new car and I’d like some advice.
MAN: Sure, yes. Had you got any particular make in mind?
WOMAN: I’m interested in a
Lida
– I’ve had one before and liked it. But I haven’t really made up my mind.
Example
MAN: Sure. We’ve got various models. Umm, right. What about the engine size? Any ideas?
WOMAN: The one I’ve got at the moment’s a 1.2 litre engine but I find it a bit slow on long journeys. I’d like a bit more power this time … a
1.4
should do, I don’t think I need a 1.6 or anything.
Q1
MAN: Right. Well I think the model you’re looking at is the Max. Here’s a picture.
WOMAN: Oh, yes … have you got one in?
MAN: Yes. I’ll take you to have a look at it in a minute. I’ll just get a few more details. Er … Is there anything else to do with the engine? What kind of gear change do you want? I presume you’d want a manual?
WOMAN: I’d want
automatic
– I’ve never driven a car with manual gears.
Q2
MAN: Right. Well now, here’s the colour chart for the Max. Have you given that any thought? This blue’s very popular at the moment.
WOMAN: Yes, it is nice, I like blue. What’s it called? ‘Royal’?
MAN: Yes.
WOMAN: But actually, I think I prefer this lighter shade here – ‘
Sky
’.
Q3
MAN: Yes, that’s popular too.
WOMAN: I think I’ll go for that.
MAN: You might have to wait a week or so for that colour, but I assume that’d be OK?
WOMAN: Oh yes, fine.
MAN: Well, we can go outside and you can have a good look at one, and perhaps take it out. But first, can I just ask you about finance? The cash price is going to be somewhere in the region of seven and a half thousand. How would you like to pay? Are you in a position to pay cash, or would you need credit?
WOMAN: I’d like
credit
provided the terms are reasonable.
Q4
MAN: Well you can discuss that with my colleague in a moment; we have various arrangements. And would you be interested in us taking your present car as part exchange?
WOMAN: Yes.
MAN: OK, fine. So I’ll just need some details from you and then we can do a valuation… Is that OK?
WOMAN: Fine, yes.
MAN: Could I have your full name?
WOMAN: Wendy Harries, that’s
H-A-double R-I-E-S
.
Q5
MAN: And is that Mrs … Miss … Ms …?
WOMAN: It’s
Doctor
, actually.
Q6
MAN: Oh, right. And your address?
WOMAN: 20 Green Banks.
MAN: Is that ‘Green’ spelled as in the colour?
WOMAN: Yes, that’s right.
MAN: OK.
WOMAN: Alton.
MAN: Is that
O-L-T-O-N
?
WOMAN: Not quite, it begins with an
A
, not an O.
Q7
MAN: Oh yes, that’s in Hampshire isn’t it?
WOMAN: That’s right.
MAN: And do you know your postcode?
WOMAN: Yes. It’s GU8 9EW.
MAN: Do you have a daytime phone number?
WOMAN: Well, I work at the hospital but it’s a bit difficult to get hold of me. I can give you a number just for
messages
, and then I’ll get back to you when I can. Is that OK?
Q8
MAN: That’s fine.
WOMAN: It’s 0-7-9-8-2-5-7-6-4-3.
MAN: Fine. And about the car you have now, what make is it?
WOMAN: It’s a Conti.
MAN: Do you know the year or the model name?
WOMAN: I think it’s 1996, and it’s called a
Lion
– like the animal.
Q9
MAN: Then it must be 1994, because they brought out the Fox after that.
WOMAN: Oh right, yes.
MAN: Mileage? Roughly?
WOMAN: I’m not sure. I know it’s less than seventy thousand.
MAN: OK. What colour is it?
WOMAN: It’s grey, metallic grey.
MAN: Right, and one last thing – what sort of condition would you say it’s in?
WOMAN: I’d probably describe it as
reasonable
. Do you need to see it? It’s parked outside.
Q10
MAN: Not at the moment, no. Perhaps you could call in one day next week…
