剑桥雅思18听力第二套题目第四部分由10道提纲型填空组成。因为题干进行了大量的同义替换，定位句子十分困难。虽然整体语速不快，但难度较大。下面是具体每道题目的答案解析。
第31题答案：convenient
对应原文：and even though we often carry bags or briefcases as well, nothing is quite as
convenient
as being able to pop your phone or credit card into your pocket.
答案解析：听到two reasons意识到答案即将到来，从题干可以推测出空上应该填一个形容词，且能修饰pockets。这一小段中只有convenient符合这两个条件，因此确定其为正确答案。
第32题答案：suits
对应原文： If we think about male fashion first … that was the time when
suits
became popular.
答案解析：18th century和male提示大家答案即将到来，从题干可以推测出空上应该填某种衣服，由此确定suits为正确答案。
第33题答案：tailor
对应原文：but all three garments were lined with material and, this article is from laokaoya website, pockets were sewn into this cloth by whichever
tailor
the customer used.
答案解析：这道题采用语序颠倒的手法，将原本位于空后的lining和garments放在了答案前面，并将题干的主动语态变成被动语态，比较考验大家的短期记忆能力和对语法的熟悉程度。
第34题答案：profession
对应原文：they were often larger but plainer if the wearer was someone with a
profession
who needed to carry medical instruments
答案解析：听到bigger与larger的同义替换意识到答案即将到来。从题干可以推测出空上应该填一个名词，且能够跟“特定类型的”构成语义通顺的短语，符合这两个条件的只有profession，因此确定它为正确答案。
第35题答案：visible
对应原文：For one thing, they weren’t nearly as
visible
or as easy to reach as men’s.
答案解析：听到women’s pockets意识到答案即将到来，空前词less与weren’t nearly同义替换，根据修饰关系，确定visible为正确答案。
第36题答案：string(s)
对应原文：what they did was to have a pair of pockets made that were tied together with
string
答案解析：听到pockets和pair意识到答案即将到来，空前词using与with同义替换（这两个词的同义替换在雅思听力中十分常见，大家要注意一下），根据修饰关系确定单位string。
第37题答案：waist(s)
对应原文：Women tied the pockets around their
waist
so that they hung beneath their clothes.
答案解析：这道题同样采用语序颠倒的手法，将空前提示词hung放在了答案之后，比较考验大家的短期记忆能力。不过，只要大家能确定答案就在这句话中，根据women’s与their的替换，很容易锁定waist。
第38题答案：perfume
对应原文：They would have an opening in the folds of their skirts through which they could reach whatever they needed, like their
perfume
答案解析：这道题相对简单一些。such as与like同义替换，根据举例，确定答案为perfume。
第39题答案：image
对应原文：That’s when dresses became tighter and less bulky, and the pairs of pockets became very noticeable – they stood out too much and detracted from the woman’s
image
答案解析：became tighter and less bulky对应题干中的changed shape，提示大家答案即将到来。’s与of对应，根据所有格的修饰关系，确定image为正确答案。
第40题答案：handbag
对应原文： That was when small bags, or pouches as they were known, came into fashion and, of course, they inevitably led on to the
handbag
of more modern times
答案解析：听到pouches意识到答案即将到来。从题干可以推测出空上应该填一个名词，而且是某种日常携带的物品，由此锁定handbag。
