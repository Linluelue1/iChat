剑桥雅思18听力第四套题目第四部分由10道提纲型填空题组成。虽然题干上的提示信息很多，但不少题目都采用语序颠倒的手法，比较考验大家的短期记忆能力。下面是具体每道题目的答案解析。
第31题答案：plot
对应原文：So, some of us, I’m sure, have a pretty general idea of the
plot
, but we know much less about the author.
答案解析：听到前文中的stage musical和film（对应theater and cinema）意识到答案即将到来，空前词overall与general，know与idea同义替换，根据修饰关系，确定plot为答案。
第32题答案：poverty
对应原文：he also gave many speeches about issues like the level of
poverty
in his society.
答案解析：听到issues意识到答案即将到来，空前词such as与like同义替换，根据举例锁定poverty为正确答案。
第33题答案：Europe
对应原文：So Victor Hugo was forced to reside in other parts of
Europe
答案解析：听到小标题中的exile意识到答案即将到来，空前词elsewhere与other parts同义替换，因此确定答案为Europe。
第34题答案：poetry
对应原文：This was a property that he bought using the money he’d made in France from the publication of a collection of his
poetry
答案解析：听到money（对应income）意识到答案即将到来，空前词some与a collection of同义替换，根据修饰关系，确定poverty为正确答案。
第35题答案：drawings
对应原文：and portraits of its members still hang in rooms on the ground floor, along with
drawings
that he did during his travels
答案解析：听到portraits和ground floor意识到答案即将到来，题干中的并列关系通过along with体现出来，由此确定drawings为正确答案。
第36题答案：furniture
对应原文：… Victor Hugo created himself using wooden
furniture
that he bought in the market. The items were relatively inexpensive, and he used them to create intricate carvings
答案解析：这道题采用语序颠倒的手法，将原本位于空前的提示词cheap（对应inexpensive）放在了答案之后，需要大家根据wooden来锁定furniture。
第37题答案：lamps
对应原文：There’s a strong Chinese influence in these areas in things like the wallpaper pattern and the
lamps
答案解析：听到Chinese意识到答案即将到来，并列词wallpaper没有任何替换，很容易确定lamps为正确答案。
第38题答案：harbour/harbor
对应原文：there’s a room called the Lookout – called that because it looks out over the
harbor
答案解析：听到room意识到答案即将到来，空前词view与looks out同义替换，由此锁定harbor为正确答案。
第39题答案：children
对应原文：he entertained many other famous writers, but he also invited a large group of local
children
from the deprived areas
答案解析：听到entertained和writers意识到答案即将到来，空前修饰词poor与deprived areas同义替换，再加上空上应该填某种人，因此锁定children。
第40题答案：relatives
对应原文：In 1927, the house was owned by his
relatives
, and they decided to donate it to the city of Paris.
答案解析：听到1927意识到答案即将到来，空前词Victor Hugo’s对应his，根据修饰关系确定relatives为正确答案。
