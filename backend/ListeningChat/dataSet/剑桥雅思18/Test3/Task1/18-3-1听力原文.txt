原文
BREDA:
Hello, Wayside Camera Club, Breda speaking.
DAN:
Oh, hello, um, my name’s Dan and I’d like to join your club.
BREDA:
That’s great, Dan. We have an application form – would you like to complete it over the phone, then you can ask any questions you might have?
DAN:
Oh, yes, thanks.
BREDA:
OK, so what’s your family name? It’s Green-Dan Green.
DAN:
So – can I take your email address? Yes, it’s dan1068@market.com.
BREDA:
Thanks. And what about your home address?
DAN:
Well, I’m about ten miles away from your club in Peacetown. I live in a house there.
BREDA:
OK, so what’s the house number and street?
DAN:
It’s 52
Marrowfield (Q1)
Street.
BREDA:
Is that M-A double R-O-W-F-I-E-L-D?
DAN:
That’s right.
BREDA:
.. and that’s Peacetown, you said?
DAN:
Uhuh.
BREDA:
So how did you hear about our club? Did you look on the internet?
DAN:
I usually do that, but this time, well, I was talking to a
relative (Q2)
the other day and he suggested it.
BREDA:
Oh, is he a member too?
DAN:
He belongs to another club – but he’d heard good things about yours.
BREDA:
OK. So what do you hope to get from joining?
DAN:
Well, one thing that really interests me is the competitions that you have. I enjoy entering those.
BREDA:
Right. Anything else?
DAN:
Well, I also like to
socialise (Q3)
with other photographers. That’s great. So what type of membership would you like? What are the options?
BREDA:
It’s 30 pounds a year for
full (Q4)
membership or 20 pounds a year if you’re an associate.
DAN:
I think I’ll go for the full membership, then.
BREDA:
That’s a good idea because you can’t vote in meetings with an associate membership.
BREDA:
If I could just find out a bit more about you…
DAN:
OK.
BREDA:
So you said you wanted to compete – have you ever won any photography competitions?
DAN:
Not yet, but I have entered three in the past.
BREDA:
Oh, that’s interesting. So why don’t you tell me something about those? Let’s start with the first one.
DAN:
Well, the theme was entitled ‘
Domestic (Q5)
Life’.
BREDA:
I see – so it had to be something related to the home?
DAN:
Yeah. I chose to take a photo of a family sitting round the dinner table having a meal,  and, um, I didn’t win, but I did get some feedback.
BREDA:
Oh, what did the judges say?
DAN:
That it was too ‘busy’ as a picture.
BREDA:
Aha- so it was the composition of the picture that they criticised?
DAN:
That’s right – and once they’d told me that, I could see my mistake.
BREDA:
So what was the theme of the second competition?
DAN:
Well, my university was on the coast and that area gets a lot of beautiful sunsets, so that was the theme.
BREDA:
Oh, sunsets, that’s a great theme.
DAN:
Yes. The instructions were to capture the
clouds (Q6)
as well – it couldn’t just be blue sky and a setting sun.
BREDA:
Sure, cause they give you all those amazing pinks and purples.
DAN:
Yeah – and I thought I’d done that well, but the feedback was that I should have waited a bit longer to get the shot.
BREDA:
I see. So the
timing (Q7)
wasn’t right.
DAN:
Yes – I took it too soon, basically. And then the third competition I entered was called ‘
Animal Magic
‘
(Q8)
.
BREDA:
Well, that’s a difficult subject!
DAN:
I know! I had to take hundreds of shots.
BREDA:
I’m sure – because animals move all the time.
DAN:
That’s what we had to show – there had to be some
movement (Q9)
in the scene. I got a great shot of a fox in the end, but I took it at night and, well, I suspected that it was a bit
dark (Q10)
, which is what I was told.
BREDA:
Well Dan – you seem to be really keen and we’d be delighted to have you in our club. I’m sure we can help with all those areas that you’ve outlined.
DAN:
Thanks, that’s great.
