原文
Yong Man:
That seminar yesterday on automation and the future of work was really good, wasn’t it? Looking at the first industrial revolution in Britain in the 19th century and seeing how people reacted to massive change was a real eye-opener.
Yong Woman:
Yes. It was interesting to hear how people felt about automation then and what challenges they faced. I didn’t know that first started with workers in the textile industry.
Yong Man:
With those protesting workers called the Luddites destroying their knitting machines because they were so worried about losing their jobs.
Yong Woman:
Yes, and
ultimately, they didn’t achieve anything (Q21)
. And anyway, industrialization created more jobs than it destroyed.
Yong Man:
Yes, that’s true – but it probably didn’t seem a positive thing at the time.
I can see why the Luddites felt so threatened (Q22).
Yong Woman:
I know. I’m sure I would have felt the same. The discussion about the future of work was really optimistic for a change. I like the idea that work won’t involve doing boring, repetitive tasks, as robots will do all that. Normally, you only hear negative stuff about the future.
Yong Man:
Bit too optimistic, don’t you think? For example, I can’t see how people are about to have more leisure time, when
all the evidence shows people are spending longer than ever at work (Q23)
.
Yong Woman:
No – that’s true. And
what about lower unemployment? I’m not so sure about that (Q24)
.
Yong Man:
Perhaps in the long term – but not in the foreseeable future.
Yong Woman:
Mmm. And I expect most people will be expected to work until they’re much older – as everyone’s living much longer.
Yong Man:
That’s already happening.
Yong Woman:
I enjoyed all that stuff on how technology has changed some jobs and how they’re likely to change in the near future.
Yong Man:
Yeah, incredible. Like accountants. You might think all the technological innovations would have put them out of a job,
but in fact there are more of them than ever. They’re still really in demand and have become far more efficient (Q25)
.
Yong Woman:
Right. That was amazing. Twenty times more accountants in this country compared to the 19th century.
Yong Man:
I know. I’d never have thought that demand for hairdressing would have gone up so much in the last hundred years. One hairdresser for every 287 people now, compared to one for over 1,500.
Yong Woman:
Yeah
because people’s earning power has gone up so they can afford to spend more on personal services like that (Q26)
.
Yong Man:
But technology hasn’t changed the actual job that much.
Yong Woman:
No, they’ve got hairdryers, etc. but it’s one job where you don’t depend on a computer … The kind of work that administrative staff do has changed enormously, thanks to technology. Even 20 years ago there were secretaries doing dictation and typing.
Yong Man:
Yes.
Really boring compared to these days when they’re given much more responsibility and higher status (Q27)
.
Yong Woman:
Mmm. A lot of graduates go in for this kind of work now … I’d expected there to be a much bigger change in the number of agricultural workers in the 19th century. But the 1871 census showed that roughly 25% of the population worked on the land.
Yong Man:
Yeah,
I’d have assumed it would be more than 50%. Now it’s less than 0.2% (Q28)
.
Yong Woman:
What about care workers?
Yong Man:
They barely existed in the 19th century as people’s lifespan was so much shorter.
But now of course this sector will see huge growth (Q29)
.
Yong Woman:
Yeah – and it’s hard enough to meet current demand. The future looks quite bleak for bank clerks. They’ve been in decline since ATMs were introduced in the eighties.
Yong Man:
And
technology will certainly make most of the jobs they do now redundant, I think (Q30)
.
Yong Woman:
I agree, although the situation may change. It’s very hard to predict what will happen.
