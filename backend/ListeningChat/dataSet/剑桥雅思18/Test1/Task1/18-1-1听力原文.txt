雅思听力
原文
MAN:
Excuse me. Would you mind if I asked you some questions? We’re doing a survey on transport.
SADIE:
Yes, that’s OK.
MAN:
First of all, can I take your name?
SADIE:
Yes. It’s Sadie Jones.
MAN:
Thanks very much. And could I have your date of birth – just the year will do, actually.  Is that all right?
SADIE:
Yes, that’s fine. It’s 1991.
MAN:
So next your postcode, please.
SADIE:
It’s
DW30 7YZ (Q1)
MAN:
Great. Thanks. Is that in Wells?
SADIE:
No it’s actually in Harborne -Wells isn’t far from there, though.
MAN:
I really like that area. My grandmother lived there when I was a kid.
SADIE:
Yes, it is nice.
MAN:
Right, so now I want to ask you some questions about how you travelled here today. Did you use public transport?
SADIE:
Yes. I came by bus.
MAN:
OK. And that was today. It’s the
24th of April (Q2)
, isn’t it?
SADIE:
SADIE: Isn’t it the 25th? No, actually, you’re right.
MAN:
Ha ha. And what was the reason for your trip today? I can see you’ve got some shopping with you.
SADIE:
Yes. I did some shopping but the main reason I came here was to go to the
dentist (Q3)
.
MAN:
That’s not much fun. Hope it was nothing serious.
SADIE:
No, it was just a check-up. It’s fine.
MAN:
Good. Do you normally travel by bus into the city centre?
SADIE:
Yes. I stopped driving in ages ago because
parking (Q4)
was so difficult to find and it costs so much.
MAN:
I see.
SADIE:
The bus is much more convenient too. This is from laokaoya website. It only takes about 30 minutes.
MAN:
That’s good. So where did you start your journey?
SADIE:
At the bus stop on
Claxby (Q5)
Street.
MAN:
Is that C-L-A-X-B-Y?
SADIE:
That’s right.
MAN:
And how satisfied with the service are you? Do you have any complaints?
SADIE:
Well, as I said, it’s very convenient and quick when it’s on time, but this morning it was
late (Q6)
. Only about 10 minutes, but still.
MAN:
Yes, I understand that’s annoying. And what about the timetable? Do you have any comments about that?
SADIE:
Mmm. I suppose I mainly use the bus during the day, but any time I’ve been in town in the
evening (Q7)
– for dinner or at the cinema – I’ve noticed you have to wait a long time for a bus – there aren’t that many.
MAN:
OK, thanks. So now I’d like to ask you about your car use.
SADIE:
Well, I have got a car but I don’t use it that often. Mainly just to go to the
supermarket (Q8)
. But that’s about it really. My husband uses it at the weekends to go to the golf club.
MAN:
And what about a bicycle?
SADIE:
I don’t actually have one at the moment.
MAN:
What about the city bikes you can rent? Do you ever use those?
SADIE:
No – I’m not keen on cycling there because of all the
pollution (Q9)
. But I would like to get a bike – it would be good to use it to get to work.
MAN:
So why haven’t you got one now?
SADIE:
Well, I live in a flat – on the second floor and it doesn’t have any
storage (Q10)
– so we’d have to leave it in the hall outside the flat.
MAN:
I see. OK. Well, I think that’s all …
