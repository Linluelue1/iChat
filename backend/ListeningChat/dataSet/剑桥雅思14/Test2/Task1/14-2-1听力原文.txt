原文
CARL:
Hi, come and take a seat.
JULIE:
Thank you.
CARL:
My name’s Carl Rogers and I’m one of the doctors here at the Total Health Clinic. So I understand this is your first visit to the clinic?
JULIE:
Yes, it is.
CARL:
OK, well I hope you’ll be very happy with the service you receive here. So if it’s alright with you I’ll take a few details to help me give you the best possible service.
JULIE:
Sure.
CARL:
So can I check first of all that we have the correct personal details for you? So your full name is Julie Anne Garcia?    Example
JULIE:
That’s correct.
CARL:
Perfect. And can I have a contact phone number?
JULIE:
It’s
219 442 9785 (Q1)
.
CARL:
OK, and then can I just check that we have the correct date of birth?
JULIE:
October tenth (Q3)
. 1992.
CARL:
Oh, I actually have 1991, I’ll just correct that now. Right, so that’s all good. Now I just need just a few more personal details … do you have an occupation, either full-time or part-time?
JULIE:
Yes, I work full-time in Esterhazy’s – you know, the restaurant chain. I started off as a waitress there a few years ago and I’m a
manager (Q3)
now.
CARL:
Oh I know them, yeah, they’re down on 114th Street, aren’t they?
JULIE:
That’s right.
CARL:
Yeah, I’ve been there a few times. I just love their salads.
JULIE:
That’s good to hear.
CARL:
Right, so one more thing I need to know before we talk about why you’re here, Julie, and that’s the name of your insurance company.
JULIE:
It’s Cawley Life Insurance, that’s
C-A-W-L-E-Y (Q4)
.
CARL:
Excellent, thank you so much.
CARL:
Now Julie, let’s look at how we can help you. So tell me a little about what brought you here today.
JULIE:
Well, I’ve been getting a pain in my
knee (Q5)
, the left one. Not very serious at first, but it’s gotten worse, so I thought I ought to see someone about it.
CARL:
That’s certainly the right decision. So how long have you been aware of this pain? Is it just a few days, or is it longer than that?
JULIE:
Longer. It’s been worse for the last couple of days, but it’s
three weeks (Q6)
since I first noticed it. It came on quite gradually though, so I kind of ignored it at first.
CARL:
And have you taken any medication yourself, or treated it in anyway?
JULIE:
Yeah, I’ve been taking medication to deal with the pain, Tylenol, and that works OK for a few hours. But I don’t like to keep taking it.
CARL:
OK. And what about heat treatment? Have you tried applying heat at all?
JULIE:
No, but I have been using ice on it for the last few days.
CARL:
And does that seem to help the pain at all?
JULIE:
A little, yes.
CARL:
Good. Now you look as if you’re quite fit normally?
JULIE:
I am, yes.
CARL:
So do you do any sport on a regular basis?
JULIE:
Yes, I play a lot of
tennis (Q7)
. I belong to a club so I go there a lot. I’m quite competitive so I enjoy that side of it as well as the exercise. But I haven’t gone since this started.
CARL:
Sure. And do you do any other types of exercise?
JULIE:
Yeah, I sometimes do a little swimming, but usually just when I’m on vacation. But normally I go
running (Q8)
a few times a week, maybe three or four times.
CARL:
Hmm. So your legs are getting quite a pounding. But you haven’t had any problems up to now?
JULIE:
No, not with my legs. I did have an accident last year when I slipped and hurt my
shoulder (Q9)
, but that’s better now.
CARL:
Excellent. And do you have any allergies?
JULIE:
No, none that I’m aware of.
CARL:
And do you take any medication on a regular basis?
JULIE:
Well, I take
vitamins (Q10)
cbut that’s all. I’m generally very healthy.
CARL:
OK, well let’s have a closer look and see what might be causing this problem. If you can just get up …
