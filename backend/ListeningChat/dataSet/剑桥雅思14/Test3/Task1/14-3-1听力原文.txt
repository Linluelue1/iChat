原文
ANGELA: Hello, Flanders conference hotel.
MAN: Oh, hi. I wanted to ask about conference facilities at the hotel. Have I come through to the right person?
ANGELA: You have. I’m the customer services manager. My name’s ANGELA. So how can I help you?
MAN: Well, I’m calling from Barrett and Stansons, we’re a medical company based in Perth.
ANGELA: Oh yes.
MAN: And we’re organising a conference for our clients to be held in Sydney. It’ll be held over two days and we’re expecting about fifty or sixty people.
ANGELA: When were you thinking of having it?
MAN: Some time early next year, like the end of January? It’d have to be a weekend.
ANGELA: Let me see … our conference facilities are already booked for the weekend beginning January 28th. We could do the first weekend in February?
MAN: How about January 21st?
ANGELA: I’m afraid that’s booked too.
MAN: Well, let’s go for the February date then.
ANGELA: So that’s the weekend beginning the 4th.
MAN: OK. Now can you tell me a bit about what conference facilities you have?
ANGELA: Sure. So for talks and presentations we have the Tesla room.
MAN: Sorry?
ANGELA:
Tesla – that’s spelled T-E-S-L-A (Q1)
. It holds up to a hundred people, and it’s fully equipped with a projector and so on.
MAN: How about a
microphone (Q2)
?
ANGELA: Yes, that’ll be all set up ready for you, and there’ll be one that members of the audience can use too, for questions, if necessary.
MAN: Fine. And we’ll also need some sort of open area where people can sit and have a cup of coffee, and we’d like to have an
exhibition (Q3)
of our products and services there as well, so that’ll need to be quite a big space.
ANGELA: That’s fine, there’s a central atrium with all those facilities, and you can come before the conference starts if you want to set everything up.
MAN: Great. And I presume there’s
wifi (Q4)
?
ANGELA: Oh yes, that’s free and available throughout the hotel.
MAN: OK.
ANGELA: Would you also like us to provide a buffet lunch? We can do a two-course meal with a number of different options.
MAN: What sort of price are we looking at for that?
ANGELA: Well, I can send you a copy of the standard menu. That’s
$45 (Q5)
per person. Or you can have the special for $25 more.
MAN: I think the standard should be OK, but yes, send me the menu.
MAN: Now we’re also going to need accommodation on the Saturday night for some of the participants … I’m not sure how many, but probably about 25. So what do you charge for a room?
ANGELA: Well, for conference attendees we have a 25% reduction, so we can offer you rooms at
$135 (Q6)
. Normally a standard room’s $180.
MAN: And does that include breakfast?
ANGELA: Sure. And of course, guests can also make use of all the other facilities at the hotel. So we’ve got a spa where you can get massages and facials and so on, and there’s a
pool (Q7)
up on the roof for the use of guests.
MAN: Great. Now what about transport links? The hotel’s downtown, isn’t it?
ANGELA: Yes, it’s about 12 kilometres from the
airport (Q8)
, but there’s a complimentary shuttle bus for guests. And it’s only about ten minutes’ walk from the central railway station.
MAN: OK. Now, I don’t know Sydney very well, can you just give me an idea of the location of the hotel?
ANGELA: Well, it’s downtown on Wilby Street, that’s quite a small street, and it’s not very far from the
sea (Q9)
. And of course if the conference attendees want to go out on the Saturday evening there’s a huge choice of places to eat. Then if they want to make a night of it, they can go on to one of the
clubs (Q10)
in the area – there are a great many to choose from.
MAN: OK. So if we go ahead with this, can you give me some information about how much …
