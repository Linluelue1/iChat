原文
OFFICER:
Good morning. What can I do for you?
LOUISE:
I want to report a theft. I had some things stolen out of my bag yesterday.
OFFICER:
I’m sorry to hear that. Right, so I’ll need to take a few details. Can I start with your name?
LOUISE:
Louise Taylor.
OFFICER:
OK, thank you. And are you resident in the UK?
LOUISE:
No, I’m actually
Canadian (Q1)
, though my mother was British.
OFFICER:
And your date of birth?
LOUISE:
December 14th, 1977.
OFFICER:
So you’re just visiting this country?
LOUISE:
That’s right. I come over most summers on business. I’m an interior designer and I come over to buy old
furniture (Q2)
, antiques you know. There are some really lovely things around here, but you need to get out to the small towns. I’ve had a really good trip this year, until this happened.
OFFICER:
OK. So you’ve been here quite a while?
LOUISE:
Yes, I’m here for two months. I go back next week.
OFFICER:
So may I ask where you’re staying now?
LOUISE:
Well at present I’ve got a place at
Park (Q3)
Apartments, that’s on King Street. I was staying at the Riverside Apartments on the same street, but the apartment there was only available for six weeks so I had to find another one.
OFFICER:
OK. And the apartment number?
LOUISE:
Fifteen.
LOUISE:
Right.
OFFICER:
Now, I need to take some details of the theft. So you said you had some things stolen out of your bag?
LOUISE:
That’s right.
OFFICER:
And were you actually carrying the bag when the theft took place?
LOUISE:
Yes. I really can’t understand it. I had my backpack on. And I went into a supermarket to buy a few things and when I opened it up my wallet wasn’t there.
OFFICER:
And what did your wallet have in it?
LOUISE:
Well, fortunately I don’t keep my credit cards in that wallet – I keep them with my passport in an inside compartment in my backpack. But there was quite a bit of cash there … about £
250 (Q4)
sterling, I should think. I withdrew £300 from my account yesterday, but I did a bit of shopping, so I must have already spent about £50 of that.
OFFICER:
OK.
LOUISE:
At first I thought, oh I must have left the wallet back in the apartment, but then I realised my
phone (Q5)
had gone as well. It was only a week old, and that’s when I realised I’d been robbed. Anyway at least they didn’t take the keys to my rental car.
OFFICER:
Yes. So you say the theft occurred yesterday?
LOUISE:
Yes.
OFFICER:
So that was
September the tenth (Q6)
. And do you have any idea at all of where or when the things might possibly have been stolen?
LOUISE:
Well at first I couldn’t believe it because the bag had been on my back ever since I left the apartment after lunch. It’s just a small backpack, but I generally use it when I’m travelling because it seems safer than a handbag. Anyway, I met up with a friend, and we spent a couple of hours in the
museum (Q7)
. But I do remember that as we were leaving there, at about 4 o’clock, a group of young boys ran up to us, and they were really crowding round us, and they were asking us what
time (Q8)
it was, then all of a sudden they ran off.
OFFICER:
Can you remember anything about them?
LOUISE:
The one who did most of the talking was wearing a T-shirt with a picture of something … let’s see … a tiger.
OFFICER:
Right. Any idea of how old he might have been?
LOUISE:
Around twelve years old?
OFFICER:
And can you remember anything else about his appearance?
LOUISE:
Not much. He was quite thin …
OFFICER:
Colour of hair?
LOUISE:
I do remember that – he was
blond (Q9)
. All the others were dark-haired.
OFFICER:
And any details of the others?
LOUISE:
Not really. They came and went so quickly.
OFFICER:
Right. So what I’m going to do now is give you a crime reference number so you can contact your insurance company. So this is ten digits:
87954 82361 (Q10)
.
LOUISE:
Thank you. So should I…
