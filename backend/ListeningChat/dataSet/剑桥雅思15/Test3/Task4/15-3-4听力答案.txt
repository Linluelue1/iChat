高频词汇
：
第31题答案：mud
对应原文：the earliest people lived near water and knew something about its cleansing properties – at least that it rinsed
mud
off their hands.
答案解析：从题目可以推测出空上应该填某种脏东西。听到water意识到答案即将到来，rinsed off与wash off同义替换，根据修饰关系或者含义均可确定mud为正确答案。
第32题答案：clay
对应原文：soapmaking was known as early as 2800 BC. Archaeologists discovered cylinders made of
clay
答案解析：听到soap意识到答案即将到来。原文进行了小小的语序颠倒，将本来位于空后的cylinders放在了答案之前，一定程度上降低了题目难度。
第33题答案：metal
对应原文：Instead, they cleaned their bodies with blocks of sand, pumice and ashes, then anointed themselves with oil, and scraped off the oil and dirt with a
metal
instrument known as a strigil
答案解析：从题干可以推测出空上应该填某种具体的材料，听到scrap意识到答案即将到来，根据事先猜测锁定metal。
第34题答案：hair
对应原文：discovering how to make a substance called ‘soap’, made of melted animal fat and ashes. They used this mixture to tint their
hair
red.
答案解析：题干中的colour为动词形式，表示给什么染色的意思，在老烤鸭雅思原文中被替换为tint，根据修饰关系确定hair为正确答案。
第35题答案：bath(s)
对应原文：As Roman civilisation advanced, so did bathing. The first of the famous Roman
baths
, supplied with water from their aqueducts, was built around 312 BC
答案解析：这道题的难点有两个：一是Roman多次出现，容易让人惊慌不定。二是将312BC这一具体的年份放在了答案之后，比较考验大家的短期记忆能力。
第36题答案：disease(s)
对应原文：This lack of personal cleanliness and related unsanitary living conditions were major factors in the outbreaks of
disease
in the Middle Ages
答案解析：听到前文中的decline意识到答案即将到来，occurrence与outbreaks同义替换，根据修饰关系锁定disease。
第37题答案：perfume
对应原文： Vegetable and animal oils were used with ashes of plants, along with
perfume
, apparently for the first time.
答案解析：一些同学可能会认为前面的vegetable, animal oils或者ashes也可以作为答案。但它们制成的是肥皂本身，而不是添加物。
第38题答案：salt
对应原文：a French chemist, Nicholas Leblanc, patented a process for turning
salt
into soda ash, or sodium carbonate.
答案解析：从题干可以推测空上应该填某种原材料。听到Leblanc意识到答案即将到来，根据含义锁定salt。
第39题答案：science
对应原文：His studies established the basis for both fat and soap chemistry, and soapmaking became a
science
答案解析：听到Chevreul意识到答案即将到来，turn into与became同义替换，由此确定science为正确答案。
第40题答案：tax
对应原文： it became an everyday necessity, a development that was reinforced when the high
tax
was removed.
答案解析：空前词no longer与removed同义替换，根据修饰关系，确定答案为tax。
