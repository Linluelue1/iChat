原文
SALLY:
Good morning.Thanks for coming in to see us here at the agency, Joe. I’m one of the agency representatives, and my name’s Sally Baker.
JOE:
Hi Sally. I think we spoke on the phone, didn’t we?
SALLY:
That’s right, we did. So thank you for sending in your CV. We’ve had quite a careful look at it and | think we have two jobs that might be suitable for you.
JOE:
OK.
SALLY:
The first one is in a company based in North London. They’re looking for an administrative assistant.
JOE:
OK. What sort of company is it?
SALLY:
They’re called Home Solutions and they design and make
furniture (Q1)
.
JOE:
Oh, I don’t know much about that, but it sounds interesting.
SALLY:
Yes, well as | said, they want someone in their office, and looking at your past experience it does look as if you fit quite a few of the requirements. So on your CV, it appears you’ve done some data entry?
JOE:
Yes.
SALLY:
So that’s one skill they want. Then they expect the person they appoint to attend
meetings (Q2)
and take notes there…
JOE:
OK. I’ve done that before, yes.
SALLY:
And you’d need to be able to cope with general admin.
JOE:
Filing, and keeping records and so on? That should be OK. And in my last job I also had to manage the
diary (Q3)
.
SALLY:
Excellent. That’s something they want here too. I’d suggest you add it to your CV – I don’t think you mentioned that, did you?
JOE:
No.
SALLY:
So as far as the requirements go, they want good computer skills, of course, and they particularly mention spreadsheets.
JOE:
That should be fine.
SALLY:
And interpersonal skills – which would be something they’d check with your references.
JOE:
I think that should be OK, yes.
SALLY:
Then they mention that they want someone who is careful and takes care with
details (Q4)
– just looking at your CV, I’d say you’re probably alright there.
JOE:
I think so, yes. Do they want any special experience?
SALLY:
I think they wanted some experience of teleconferencing.
JOE:
I’ve got three years’ experience of that.
SALLY:
Let’s see, yes, good. In fact, they’re only asking for
at least one year (Q5)
, so that’s great. So is that something that might interest you?
JOE:
It is, yes. The only thing is, you said they were in North London so it would be quite a long commute for me.
SALLY:
OK.
SALLY:
So the second position might suit you better as far as the location goes; that’s for a warehouse assistant and that’s in South London.
JOE:
Yes, that would be a lot closer.
SALLY:
And you’ve worked in a warehouse before, haven’t you?
JOE:
Yes.
SALLY:
So as far as the responsibilities for this position go, they want someone who can manage the stock, obviously, and also
deliveries (Q6)
.
JOE:
That should be OK. You’ve got to keep track of stuff, but I’ve always been quite good with numbers.
SALLY:
Good. That’s their first requirement. And they want someone who’s computer literate, which we know you are.
JOE:
Sure.
SALLY:
Then they mention organisational skills. They want someone who’s well organised.
JOE:
Yes, I think l am.
SALLY:
And
tidy (Q7)
?
JOE:
Yes, they go together really, don’t they?
SALLY:
Sure. Then the usual stuff; they want someone who can communicate well both orally and in writing.
JOE:
OK. And for the last warehouse job I had, one of the things | enjoyed most was being part of a
team (Q8)
. I found that was really essential for the job.
SALLY:
Excellent. Yes, they do mention that they want someone who’s used to that, yes. Now when you were working in a warehouse last time, what sorts of items were you dealing with?
JOE:
It was mostly bathroom and kitchen equipment, sinks and stoves and fridges.
SALLY:
So you’re OK moving
heavy (Q9)
things?
JOE:
Sure. I’m quite strong, and I’ve had the training.
SALLY:
Good. Now as far as experience goes, they mention they want someone with a licence, and that you have experience of driving in London so you can cope with the traffic and so on.
JOE:
Yes, no problem.
SALLY:
And you’ve got experience of warehouse work … and the final thing they mention is
customer (Q10)
service. I think looking at your CV you’re OK there.
JOE:
Right. So what about pay? Can you tell me a bit more about that, please …
