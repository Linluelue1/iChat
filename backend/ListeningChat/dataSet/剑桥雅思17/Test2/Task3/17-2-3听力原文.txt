原文
ED:
Did you make notes while you were watching the performances of
Romeo and
Juliet
, Gemma?
GEMMA:
Yes, I did. I found it quite hard though. I kept getting too involved in the play.
ED:
Me too. I ended up not taking notes. I wrote down my impressions when I got home. Do you mind if I check a few things with you? In case I’ve missed anything. And I’ve also got some questions about our assignment.
GEMMA:
No, it’s good to talk things through. I may have missed things too.
ED:
OK great. So first of all, I’m not sure how much information we should include in our reviews.
GEMMA:
Right. Well, I don’t think we need to describe what happens. Especially as
Romeo and Juliet
is one of Shakespeare’s most well-known plays.
ED:
Yeah, everyone knows the story. In an essay we’d focus on the poetry and Shakespeare’s use of imagery etc., but that isn’t really relevant in a review. We’re supposed to focus on how effective this particular production is.
GEMMA:
Mmm. We should say what made it a success or a failure.
ED:
And part of that means talking about
the emotional impact the performance had on us (Q21)
. I think that’s important.
GEMMA:
Yes. And we should definitely mention
how well the director handled important
bits of the play – like when Romeo climbs onto Juliet’s balcony (Q22)
.
ED:
And
the fight between Mercutio and Tybalt (Q22)
.
GEMMA:
Yes. It would also be interesting to mention the theatre space how the director used it but I don’t think we’ll have space in 800 words.
ED:
No. OK. That all sounds quite straightforward.
ED:
So what about The Emporium Theatre’s production of the play?
GEMMA:
I thought some things worked really well but there were some problems too.
ED:
Yeah. What about the set, for example?
GEMMA:
I think
it was visually really stunning (Q23)
. I’d say that was probably the most memorable thing about this production.
ED:
You’re right.
The set design was really amazing (Q23)
, but actually I have seen similar ideas used in other productions.
GEMMA:
What about the lighting? Some of the scenes were so dimly lit it was quite hard to see.
ED:
I didn’t
dislike
it.
It helped to change the mood of the quieter scenes (Q24)
.
GEMMA:
That’s a good point.
ED:
What did you think of the costumes?
GEMMA:
I was a bit surprised by the contemporary dress (Q25)
, I must say.
ED:
Yeah – I think it worked well, but
I had assumed it would be more conventional (Q25)
.
GEMMA:
Me too. I liked the music at the beginning and I thought the musicians were brilliant, but
I thought they were wasted because the music didn’t have much
impact in Acts 2 and 3 (Q26)
.
ED:
Yes –
that was a shame (Q26)
.
GEMMA:
One problem with this production was that the actors didn’t deliver the lines that well.
They were speaking too fast (Q27)
.
ED:
It was a problem I agree, but I thought it was
because they weren’t speaking
loudly enough – especially at key points in the play (Q27)
.
GEMMA:
I actually didn’t have a problem with that.
ED:
It’s been an interesting experience watching different versions of
Romeo and
Juliet
, hasn’t it?
GEMMA:
Definitely. It’s made me realise how relevant the play still is.
ED:
Right. I mean a lot’s changed since Shakespeare’s time, but in many ways nothing’s changed.
There are always disagreements and tension between teenagers and their parents (Q28)
.
GEMMA:
Yes, that’s something all young people can relate to – more than the violence and the extreme emotions in the play.
ED:
How did you find watching it in translation?
GEMMA:
Really interesting. I expected to find it more challenging, but I could follow the story pretty well.
ED:
I stopped worrying about not being able to understand all the words and focused on the actors’ expressions.
The ending was pretty powerful (Q29)
.
GEMMA:
Yes.
That somehow intensified the emotion for me (Q29)
.
ED:
Did you know Shakespeare’s been translated into more languages than any other writer?
GEMMA:
What’s the reason for his international appeal, do you think?
ED:
I was reading that it’s because his plays are about basic themes that people everywhere are familiar with.
GEMMA:
Yeah, and
they can also be understood on different levels (Q30)
. The characters have such depth.
ED:
Right – which
allows directors to experiment and find new angles (Q30)
.
GEMMA:
That’s really important because …
