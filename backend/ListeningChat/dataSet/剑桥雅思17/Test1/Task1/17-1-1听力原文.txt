原文
PETER
: Hello?
JAN
: Oh hello. My name’s Jan. Are you the right person to talk to about the Buckworth Conservation Group?
PETER
: Yes, I’m Peter. I’m the secretary.
JAN
: Good. I’ve just moved to this area, and I’m interested in getting involved. I was in a similar group where I used to live. Could you tell me something about your activities, please?
PETER
: Of course. Well, we have a mixture of regular activities and special events. One of the regular ones is trying to keep the beach free of
litter (Q1)
. A few of us spend a couple of hours a month on it, and it’s awful how much there is to clear. I wish people would be more responsible and take it home with them.
JAN
: I totally agree. I’d be happy to help with that. Is it OK to take
dogs (Q2)
?
PETER
: I’m afraid not, as they’re banned from the beach itself. You can take them along the cliffs, though. And children are welcome.
JAN
: Right.
PETER
: We also manage a nature reserve, and there’s a lot to do there all year round. For example, because it’s a popular place to visit, we spend a lot of time looking after the paths and making sure they’re in good condition for walking.
JAN
: I could certainly help with that.
PETER
: Good. And we have a programme of creating new habitats there. We’ve just finished making and installing nesting boxes for birds to use, and next we’re going to work on encouraging
insects (Q3)
– they’re important for the biodiversity of the reserve.
JAN
: They certainly are.
PETER
: Oh, and we’re also running a project to identify the different species of
butterflies (Q4)
that visit the reserve. You might be interested in taking part in that.
JAN
: Sure. I was involved in something similar where I used to live, counting all the species of moths. I’d enjoy that.
PETER
: Another job we’re doing at the reserve is replacing the
wall (Q5)
on the southern side, between the parking area and our woodshed. It was badly damaged in a storm last month.
JAN
: OK
PETER
: Then as I said, we have a programme of events as well, both at the weekend, and during the week.
JAN
: Right. I presume you have guided walks? I’d like to get to know the local countryside, as I’m new to the area.
PETER
: Yes, we do. The next walk is to Ruston Island, a week on Saturday. We’ll be meeting in the car park at Dunsmore Beach at low tide – that’s when the sands are dry enough for us to walk to the
island (Q6)
without getting wet.
JAN
: Sounds good
PETER
: The island’s a great place to explore. It’s quite small, and it’s got a range of habitats. It’s also an ideal location for seeing seals just off the coast, or even on the beach.
JAN
: OK. And is there anything we should bring, like a picnic, for instance?
PETER
: Yes, do bring one, as it’s a full-day walk. And of course it’ll be wet walking across and back, so make sure your
boots (Q7)
are waterproof.
JAN
: I must buy a new pair – there’s a hole in one of my current ones! Well, I’d definitely like to come on the walk.
PETER
: Great. Then later this month we’re having a one-day woodwork session in Hopton Wood.
JAN
: I’ve never tried that before. Is it OK for
beginners (Q8)
to take part?
PETER
: Definitely. There’ll be a couple of experts leading the session, and we keep the number of participants down, so you’ll get as much help as you need.
JAN
: Excellent! I’d love to be able to make chairs.
PETER
: That’s probably too ambitious for one day! You’ll be starting with wooden
spoons (Q9)
, and of course learning how to use the tools. And anything you make is yours to take home with you.
JAN
: That sounds like fun. When is it?
PETER
: It’s on the 17th, from 10 a.m. until 3. There’s a charge of
£35 (Q10)
, including lunch, or £40 if you want to camp in the wood.
JAN
: I should think I’ll come home the same day. Well, I’d certainly like to join the group.
