雅思听力
原文
MAN: Hello, this is Land Transport Information at Toronto Airport. How may I help you?
WOMAN: Oh, good morning. Um, I’m flying to Toronto Airport next week, and I need to get to a town called um, Milton. Could you tell me how I can get there?
MAN: Milton, did you say? Let me see. I think that’s about 150 miles southwest of here. In fact it’s
147 miles
to be exact, so it’ll take you at least – say, three to four hours by road.
Example
WOMAN: Wow! Is it as far as that?
MAN: Yes, I’m afraid so. But you have a number of options to get you there and you can always rent a car right here at the airport, of course.
WOMAN: Right. Well, I don’t really want to drive myself, so I’d like more information about public transport.
MAN: OK. In that case the quickest and most comfortable is
a cab
and of course there are always plenty available. But it’ll cost you. You can also take a Greyhound bus or there’s an Airport Shuttle Service to Milton.
Q1
WOMAN: Hmmm, I think for that kind of distance a cab would be way beyond my budget. But the bus sounds OK. Can you tell me how much that would cost?
MAN: Sure. Let’s see, that would be $15 one way, or $27.50 return… that’s on the Greyhound.
WOMAN: Oh, that’s quite cheap – great! But whereabouts does it stop in Milton?
MAN: It goes directly from the airport here to the
City Centre
and it’s pretty fast. But you have to bear in mind that there is only one departure a day, so it depends what time your flight gets in.
Q2
WOMAN: Oh, of course. Hang on, we’re due to get there at 11.30 am.
MAN: Hmmm, too bad, the bus leaves at 3.45,
so you would have quite a wait
– more than 4 hours.
Q3
WOMAN: Oh, I see. Well, what about the Shuttle you mentioned?
MAN: OK. That’s the Airport Shuttle that will take you from the airport right to your hotel or private address.
It’s a door-to-door service
and it would suit you much better, because there’s one every two hours.
Q4
WOMAN: So how much does that cost?
MAN: Let’s see. Yeah, that’s $35 one way, $65 return, so I guess it’s a bit more expensive than the Greyhound.
WOMAN: Oh, that doesn’t sound too bad, especially if it’ll take me straight to the hotel.
MAN: But you do need to
reserve a seat
.
Q5
WOMAN: OK, is it possible to make a booking right now? Through you?
MAN: Sure.
MAN: OK, I just have to fill this form out for you. So what date do you want to book this for?
WOMAN: The 16th of October – oh, no, sorry, that’s my departure date.
I arrive on the 17th
, so book it for then, please.
Q6
MAN: So, that’s the Toronto Airport Shuttle to Milton. And this is for just one person or…?
WOMAN: Yes, just me, please.
MAN: Right. And you said your expected time of arrival was 11.30? So if I book your Shuttle for after 12.00 – let’s say,
12.30
: that should give you plenty of time to, you know, collect your baggage, maybe grab a coffee?
Q7
WOMAN:
Yeah, that sounds fine
, as long as we land on time!
MAN: Well, we’ll take your flight details so you don’t need to worry too much about that. Now, what about the fare? What sort of ticket do you want? One way or…?
WOMAN: Yes, that’ll be fine, provided I can book the return trip once I’m there.
MAN: No problem -just allow a couple of days in advance to make sure you get a seat. And what’s your name, please?
WOMAN.: Janet, Janet Thomson.
MAN: Is that Thompson spelt with a p.
WOMAN: No, it’s
T-H-O-M-S-O-N
.
Q8
MAN: OK. And you’ll be coming from the UK? What flight will you be travelling on?
WOMAN: Oh, it’s Air Canada flight number
AC936
, from London Heathrow.
Q9
WMAN: Right. Now, do you know where you’ll be staying? We need to give the driver an address.
WOMAN: Yes, it’s called the Vacation Motel – and I think it’s near the town centre. Anyway, the address is 24, Kitchener Street – that’s KITCHENER Street.
MAN: That’s fine. Right, so that’s $35 to pay please. Have you got your credit card number there?
WOMAN: Yes, it’s a VISA card, and the number is
3303 8450 2045 6837
.
Q10
MAN: OK. Well, that seems to be everything. Have a good trip and we’ll see you in Toronto next week!
WOMAN: Yes, bye – oh, thanks for your help!
