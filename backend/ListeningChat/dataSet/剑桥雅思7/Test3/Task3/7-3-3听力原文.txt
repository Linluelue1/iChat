剑桥雅思7 Test 3 Section 3听力原文与答案 ocean research
剑桥雅思7的这篇雅思听力Section 3介绍了某个利用浮标进行海洋研究的项目。内容上其实更加偏向于Section 4的常见话题，而非Section 3的学术讨论。虽然出了三道看起来很吓人的图形填空，但做起来难度并不大。甚至因为题干中给出的信息比较多，我们完全可以忽略图形内容。

原文
SIMON: Thanks to all of you for coming along today to hear about how the robotic float project is helping with ocean research. Well, first of all, we’ll look at what a robotic float does and its use. So let’s start with the device itself. It looks a bit like a
cigar
and it’s about one and a half meters long. More importantly, it’s full of equipment that’s designed to collect data. So, it can help us in building up a profile of different factors which work together within the world’s oceans.
Q21
STUDENT I: Sounds like a big project – isn’t it too big for one country to undertake?
SIMON: That’s quite true but this project is a really good example of international co-operation. Over the last five years scientists from
thirteen countries
have been taking part in the project and launching floats in their area of ocean control. And next year this number will rise to fourteen when Indonesia joins the project.
Q22
STUDENT 2: That’s impressive.
SIMON: But let’s move onto how floats work.
SIMON: The operational cycle goes like this. Each of the floats is dropped in the ocean from a boat at a set point and
activated
from a satellite. Then the float immediately sinks about 2,000 meters… that’s two whole kilometers down in the water. It stays at this depth for about 10days and is carried around by the currents which operate in the ocean at this level. During this time it’s possible for it to cover quite large distances but the average is
fifty kilometers
.
Q23 Q24
STUDENT 2: So what is it actually recording?
SIMON: Well at this stage nothing, but as it rises to the surface it collects all sorts of data, most importantly variations in salinity, that’s salt levels, and the changes in
temperature
, a bit like underwater weather balloons. Then when it gets back to the surface all the data it’s collected is beamed up to the satellite. After about five hours on the surface, the float automatically sinks, beginning the whole process again.
Q25
STUDENT I: What happens to the data?
SIMON: Well the information is transferred direct to onshore meteorological stations… like our one in Hobart… and within four hours the findings can be on computers and they can be mapped and analysed.
STUDENT 2: You say you’re building models of the world’s ocean systems but how’re they going to be used, and more importantly, when?
SIMON:
Some of the data has already helped in completing projects. For example, our understanding of the underlying causes of El Niño
events is being confirmed by float data. Another way we’re using float data is to help us to
understand the mechanics of climate change, like global warming and ozone depletion. That’s part of an ongoing variability study but the results are still a long way off
.
Q26 Q27
However, this is not the case with our ocean weather forecasting. Because we know from the floats what the prevailing weather conditions will be in certain parts of the ocean, we can advise the navy
on search and rescue missions. That’s happening right now
and many yachtsmen owe their lives to the success of this project. In addition, the float data can help us to look at the biological implications of ocean processes.
Q28
STUDENT 1 : Would that help
with preserving fish stocks
?
Q29
SIMON: Yes, and advising governments on fisheries legislation. We’re well on the way to completing a project on this. We hope it will help to bring about more
sustainable fishing practices. We’ll be seeing the results of that quite soon
.
STUDENT 2: It sounds like the data from floats has lots of applications.
SIMON: Yes it does. It’s also a powerful agricultural tool. If we were aware of what the weather would be like, say, next year, we could make sure that the farmers planted appropriate grain varieties to produce the best yield from the available rainfall. STUDENT I: That sounds a bit like science fiction, especially when now we can’t even tell them when a drought will break.
SIMON: I agree that this concept
is still a long way in the future
, but it will come eventually and the float data will have made a contribution.
