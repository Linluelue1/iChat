原文
AGENT: Good morning.
STUDENT: Oh, good morning. Is this… er… room number 26?
AGENT: Yes, that’s right.
STUDENT: So is this the Student Job Centre?
AGENT: It certainly is. How can I help you?
STUDENT: Well, actually I’m looking for a job –
a part-time job
. Do you have anything available at the moment?
Example
AGENT: Ah, yes… Are you a registered student? I’m afraid this service is only available to full-time students.
STUDENT: Yes… I am. I’m doing a degree in
Business Studies
. Here’s my student card.
Q1
AGENT: Which year are you in?
STUDENT: Well… I’ve been at uni for four years but I’m
in the Third Year
because I took last year off.
Q2
AGENT: Right… well, let’s just have a look at what positions are available at the moment. There’s a job working at the reception desk
at the Sports Centre
, for three evenings a week – that’s Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.
Q3
STUDENT: That sounds like fun but unfortunately I have evening lectures – so that’s not possible, I’m afraid. Is there anything during the day?
AGENT: OK, that’s no good then. Um. What about cleaning? There’s a position
for a cleaner
at the Child Care Centre.
Q4
STUDENT: Right…
AGENT: But you’d need to be there at 6 am. Does that appeal?
STUDENT: Six o’clock in the morning! Oh, that’s far too early for me, I’m afraid. I’d never make it that early in the morning.
AGENT: Mmm… Well – there was a position going in the Computer Lab. for three days a week that might be OK. Ah, here it is! No,
it’s in the Library
, not the Lab., Clerical Assistant required – I think it mostly involves putting the books back on the shelves. Oh no – hang on. It’s for Wednesday and Friday evenings again.
Q5
STUDENT: No – I can’t manage that because of the lectures.
AGENT: OK, I’m getting the idea. Look, I’ll just get a few details from you anyway, and then we can check through the list and see what comes up.
AGENT: We’ll fill in the personal details on this application form first, if that’s OK?
STUDENT: Yes, that’s fine.
AGENT: Now, what’s your name again?
STUDENT: Anita Newman – that’s N-E-W-M-A-N.
AGENT: And your address, Anita?
STUDENT: I’m in one of the Halls of Residence for post-graduate students, you know,
International House
.
Q6
AGENT: OK  that’s easy. What’s your room number there?
STUDENT: Room B569 – no sorry
B659
. I always get that wrong. I haven’t been living there very long.
Q7
AGENT: Do you have any other skills? Typing, languages, that sort of thing?
STUDENT: Well, I speak some Japanese.
AGENT: Right, I’ll make a note of that. Now – let’s see what else is available. What do you think of administrative work? There is a position for an
Office Assistant
at the English Language Centre.
Q8
STUDENT: That sounds interesting.
AGENT: It’s for 3 days a week – Monday, Friday and Saturday mornings. Interested?
STUDENT: Mmm. I was hoping to have Saturdays free. But I need the work so … can you tell me what the job involves?
AGENT: Yes, sure. It says here that you’ll be required to deal with student enquiries and
answer the phone
.
Q9
STUDENT: I’m sure I can handle all that without a problem.
AGENT: Great. Well, would you like me to arrange an interview for you? Say, Friday morning, around ten?
STUDENT: Could we make it a bit later? Unfortunately, I’ve got something to do at ten. Would that be OK?
AGENT: Not a problem. How about
eleven thirty
? Hope it works out for you Anita.
Q10
STUDENT: Me too. And thanks for all your help.
