原文
MARTHA:
Hi Alex. It’s Martha Clines here. James White gave me your number. I hope you don’t mind me calling you.
ALEX:
Of course not. How are you, Martha?
MARTHA:
Good thanks. I’m ringing because I need a bit of advice.
ALEX:
Oh yeah. What about?
MARTHA:
The training you did at JPNW a few years ago. I’m applying for the same thing.
ALEX:
Oh right. Yes, I did mine in 2014. Best thing I ever did. I’m still working there. Example
MARTHA:
Really? What are you doing?
ALEX:
Well, now I work in the customer services department but I did my initial training in
Finance (Q1)
. I stayed there for the first two years and then moved to where I am now.
MARTHA:
That’s the same department I’m applying for. Did you enjoy it?
ALEX:
I was pretty nervous to begin with. I didn’t do well in my exams at school and I was really worried because I failed
Maths (Q2)
. But it didn’t actually matter because I did lots of courses on the job.
MARTHA:
Did you get a diploma at the end of your trainee period? I’m hoping to do the one in
business (Q3)
skills.
ALEX:
Yes. That sounds good. I took the one on IT skills but I wish I’d done that one instead.
MARTHA:
OK, that’s good to know. What about the other trainees? How did you get on with them?
ALEX:
There were about 20 of us who started at the same time and we were all around the same age -I was 18 and there was only one person younger than me. who was
17 (Q4)
. The rest were between 18 and 20. I made some good friends.
MARTHA:
I’ve heard lots of good things about the training at JPNW. It seems like there are a lot of opportunities there.
ALEX:
Yeah, definitely. Because of its size you can work in loads of different areas within the organisation.
MARTHA:
What about pay? I know you get a lower minimum wage than regular employees.
ALEX:
That’s right – which isn’t great. But you get the same number of days’
holiday (Q5)
as everyone else. And the pay goes up massively if they offer you a job at the end of the training period.
MARTHA:
Yeah, but I’m not doing it for the money – it’s the experience I think will be really useful. Everyone says by the end of the year you gain so much confidence.
ALEX:
You’re right. That’s the most useful part about it. There’s a lot of variety too. You’re given lots of different things to do. I enjoyed it all – I didn’t even mind the studying.
MARTHA:
Do you have to spend any time in
college (Q6)
?
ALEX:
Yes, one day each month. So you get lots of support from both your tutor and your manager.
MARTHA:
That’s good. And the company is easy to get to, isn’t it?
ALEX:
Yes, it’s very close to the train station so the
location’s (Q7)
a real advantage.
ALEX:
Have you got a date for your interview yet?
MARTHA:
Yes, it’s on the 23rd of this month.
ALEX:
So long as you’re well prepared there’s nothing to worry about. Everyone’s very friendly.
MARTHA:
I am not sure what I should wear. What do you think?
ALEX:
Nothing too casual – like
jeans (Q8)
, for example. If you’ve got a nice jacket, wear that with a skirt or trousers.
MARTHA:
OK. Thanks. Any other tips?
ALEX:
Erm, well I know it’s really obvious but arrive in plenty of time. They hate people who are
late (Q9)
. So make sure you know exactly where you have to get to. And one other useful piece of advice my manager told me before I had the interview for this job – is to
smile (Q10)
. Even if you feel terrified. It makes people respond better to you.
MARTHA:
I’ll have to practise doing that in the mirror!
ALEX:
Yeah – well, good luck. Let me know if you need any more information.
MARTHA:
Thanks very much.
