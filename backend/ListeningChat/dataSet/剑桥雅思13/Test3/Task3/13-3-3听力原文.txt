原文
TUTOR:
OK, Jim. You wanted to see me about your textile design project.
JIM:
That’s right. I’ve been looking at how a range of natural dyes can be used to colour fabrics like cotton and wool.
TUTOR:
Why did you choose that topic?
JIM:
Well, I got a lot of useful ideas from the museum, you know, at that exhibition of textiles. But I’ve always been interested in anything to do with colour.
Years ago, I went to a carpet shop with my parents when we were on holiday in Turkey, and I remember all the amazing colours (Q21)
.
TUTOR:
They might not all have been natural dyes.
JIM:
Maybe not, but for the project I decided to follow it up. And I found a great book about a botanic garden in California that specialises in plants used for dyes.
TUTOR:
OK. So, in your project, you had to include a practical investigation.
JIM:
Yeah. At first I couldn’t decide on my variables. I was going to just look at one type of fibre for example, like cotton …
TUTOR:
… and see how different types of dyes affected it?
JIM:
Yes.
Then I decided to include others as well, so I looked at cotton and wool and nylon (Q22)
.
TUTOR:
With just one type of dye?
JIM:
Various types, including some that weren’t natural, for comparison.
TUTOR:
OK.
JIM:
So, I did the experiments last week. I used some ready-made natural dyes, I found a website which supplied them, they came in just a few days, but I also made some of my own.
TUTOR:
That must have taken quite a bit of time.
JIM:
Yes, I’d thought it’d just be a matter of a teaspoon or so of dye, and actually that wasn’t the case at all.
Like I was using one vegetable, beetroot, for a red dye, and I had to chop up a whole pile of it (Q23)
. So it all took longer than I’d expected.
TUTOR:
One possibility is to use food colourings.
JIM:
I did use one. That was a yellow dye, an artificial one.
TUTOR:
Tartrazine?
JIM:
Yeah. I used it on cotton first. It came out a great colour,
but when I rinsed the material, the colour just washed away (Q24)
. I’d been going to try it out on nylon, but I abandoned that idea.
TUTOR:
Were you worried about health issues?
JIM:
I’d thought if it’s a legal food colouring, it must be safe.
TUTOR:
Well, it can occasionally cause allergic reactions, I believe.
TUTOR:
So what natural dyes did you look at?
JIM:
Well, one was turmeric. The colour’s great, it’s a really strong yellow. It’s generally used in dishes like curry.
TUTOR:
It’s meant to be quite good for your health when eaten, but you might find
it’s not permanent when it’s used as a dye – a few washes, and it’s gone (Q25)
.
JIM:
Right. I used beetroot as a dye for wool. When I chop up beetroot to eat I always end up with bright red hands,
but the wool ended up just a sort of watery cream shade (Q26)
. Disappointing.
TUTOR:
There’s a natural dye called Tyrian purple. Have you heard of that?
JIM:
Yes. It comes from a shellfish, and it was worn in ancient times but only by important people as
it was so rare. I didn’t use it.
TUTOR:
It fell out of use centuries ago (Q27)
. though one researcher managed to get hold of some recently. But that shade of purple can be produced by chemical dyes nowadays. Did you use any black dyes?
JIM:
Logwood. That was quite complicated. I had to prepare the fabric so the dye would take.
TUTOR:
I hope you were careful to wear gloves.
JIM:
Yes. I know the danger with that dye.
TUTOR:
Good.
It can be extremely dangerous if it’s ingested (Q28)
. Now, presumably you had a look at an insect-based dye? Like cochineal, for example?
JIM:
Yes. I didn’t actually make that, I didn’t have time to start crushing up insects to get the red colour and anyway they’re not available here, but I managed to get the dye quite easily from a website.
But it cost a fortune (Q29)
. I can see why it’s generally just used in cooking, and in small quantities.
TUTOR:
Yes, it’s very effective, but that’s precisely why it’s not used as a dye.
JIM:
I also read about using metal oxide. Apparently you can allow iron to rust while it’s in contact with the fabric, and that colours it.
TUTOR:
Yes, that works well for dying cotton. But you have to be careful as
the metal can actually affect the fabric (Q30)
and so you can’t expect to get a lot of wear out of fabrics treated in this way. And the colours are quite subtle, not everyone likes them. Anyway, it looks as if you’ve done a lot of work …
