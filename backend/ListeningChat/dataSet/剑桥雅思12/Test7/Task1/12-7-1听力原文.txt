原文
SUSIE:
Hello?
PAUL:
Hi, Susie, it’s Paul here.
How are you? Enjoying your new job?
You’re working at the library, aren’t you?
SUSIE:
Yes. I started when the library re-opened a month ago. It’s great.
PAUL:
Actually Carol and I have been meaning to join for a while.
SUSIE:
Oh, you should. It doesn’t cost anything, and the new library has all sorts of facilities.
It’s not just a place where you borrow books.
For
instance
, there’s an area with comfortable seats where you can sit and read the magazines they have there.
Some people spend the whole morning there.
PAUL:
Mmm. Wish I had that amount of time to spend!
SUSIE:
Yes, you must be pretty busy at present, with the children and everything?
PAUL:
We are, yes. But we’re hoping to get away this summer.
We’re thinking of going to Greece.
SUSIE:
Well, we’ve got a much larger section of the library devoted to
travel (Q1)
books now, so you should come and have a look.
I can’t remember if there’s anything specifically on Greece, but I should think so.
PAUL:
OK. Now Carol’s organising a project for the history class she teaches at school – it’s about life in the town a hundred years ago.
Do you have anything that might be useful?
SUSIE:
Yes, actually we’ve now got a new section with materials on the
history (Q2)
of the town and surrounding region.
PAUL:
Right. I’ll tell her.
You can’t always find that sort of thing on the internet.
Now in the old library there used to be a separate room with reference books.
It was a really nice quiet room.
SUSIE:
Yes. We’ve put those books in the main part of the library now, but we do have a room called the community room.
It can be hired out for meetings.
But at other times people can use it to
study (Q3)
.
PAUL:
I might use that.
It’s hard to find anywhere quiet at home sometimes.
SUSIE:
I can’t remember how old your son and daughter are.
We’ve introduced a special section of fiction written specially for
teenagers (Q4)
, but they might be a bit young for that?
PAUL:
Yes, they would be.
SUSIE:
Well, we do have lots of activities for younger children.
PAUL:
Yes?
SUSIE:
For example we have a Science Club.
At the next meeting, they’re going to be doing experiments with stuff that everyone has in the
kitchen (Q5)
– sugar and
flour
and so on.
PAUL:
They might be interested, yes.
SUSIE:
And we have a competition for children called Reading Challenge.
That doesn’t begin until after the end of term.
They have to read six books, and they get a certificate if they manage it.
PAUL:
So that gives them something to do while they’re on holiday, instead of getting bored.
SUSIE:
That’s the idea. And there’s special activities for adults too.
On Friday we have a local author called Tanya Streep who’s going to be talking about her new novel. .
It’s called “Catch the Mouse” and she based the story on a
crime (Q6)
that actually took place here years ago.
PAUL:
Right. We’re not free on Friday, but I’ll look out for the book.
SUSIE:
Now this probably isn’t for you, but we do have IT support available for members.
We get quite a few older people coming along who are wanting to get up to speed with computer technology.
It’s on Tuesday mornings – they don’t need to make an
appointment (Q7)
or anything, they just turn up.
PAUL:
Well, my mother might be interested, I’ll let her know.
SUSIE:
OK. And there’s another service which you wouldn’t expect from a library,
which is a free medical check-up.
The hospital arranges for someone to come along and measure the level of
sugar (Q8)
in your blood,
and they check
cholesterol
levels at the same time.
PAUL:
Really?
SUSIE:
Yes, but that’s only for the over-60s, so you wouldn’t qualify.
PAUL:
OK, Well, I’ll tell my mother, she might be interested.
SUSIE:
What other information…
Well, we do have a little shop with things like wall charts and greetings cards, and also
stamps (Q9)
,
so you can post the cards straightaway, which is really useful.
PAUL:
Yeah. Well, I’ll bring the children round at the weekend and we’ll join.
Oh, one more thing – I’ll be bringing the car, is there
parking (Q10)
available?
SUSIE:
Yes. and it’s free in the evening and at weekends.
PAUL:
Perfect. Well, thanks, Susie, see you soon.
