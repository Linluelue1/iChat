原文
JOHN: Erm… hello Professor, I’m John Wishart.
I’m working on my entry for the Global Design Competition.
My tutor said you might be able to help me with it.
PROFESSOR: Ah, yes. I got a copy of your drawings.
Come in and tell me about it.
What sort of competition is it?
JOHN: Well, It’s an international design competition and we have to come up with a new design for a typical domestic kitchen appliance.
PROFESSOR: I see, and are there any special conditions?
Does it have to save energy for example?
JOHN: Actually that was the focus in last year’s competition.
This year’s different.
We have to adopt an
innovative
approach to existing technology (Q21)
, using it in a way that hasn’t been thought of before.
PROFESSOR: I see, that sounds tricky.
And what kitchen appliance have you chosen?
JOHN: Well, I decided to choose the dishwasher.
PROFESSOR: Interesting, what made you choose that?
JOHN: Well, they’re an everyday kitchen appliance in most Australian houses but they’re all pretty boring and almost
identical
to each other.
I think some people will be prepared to pay a little extra for something that looks different (Q22)
.
PROFESSOR: That’s a nice idea.
I see you’ve called your design ‘the Rockpool’; why is that?
JOHN: Basically because it looks like the rock pools you find on a beach.
The top is made of glass so that you can look down into it.
PROFESSOR: And there’s a stone at the bottom.
Is that just for decoration?
JOHN: Actually it does have a function.
Instead of pushing a button, you turn the stone (Q23)
.
PROFESSOR: So it’s really just a novel way of starting the dishwasher.
JOHN: That’s right.
PROFESSOR: It’s a really nice design, but what makes it
innovative
?
JOHN: Well, I decided to make a dishwasher that uses
carbon
dioxide
.
PROFESSOR: In place of water and
detergent
?
How will you manage that?
JOHN: The idea is to pressurise the
carbon
dioxide
so that it becomes a liquid.
The
fluid
is then released into the dishwasher where it cleans the dishes all by itself.
PROFESSOR: Sounds like a brilliant idea!
Your system will totally do away with the need for strong detergents.
So what happens once the dishes are clean?
JOHN: Well, to allow them to dry, the liquid
carbon
dioxide
and the waste materials all go to an area called the holding
chamber
.
That’s where the liquid is depressurised and so it reverts to a gas (Q24)
.
Then the oil and
grease
are separated out and sent to the waste system.
PROFESSOR: It sounds like you’ve thought it all out very thoroughly.
So, what happens to the
carbon
dioxide
once the process is complete?
Not wasted I hope.
JOHN: Actually, that’s where the real savings are made.
The
carbon
dioxide
is sent back to the cylinder and can be used again and again (Q25)
.
PROFESSOR: What a terrific idea.
Do you think it will ever be built?
JOHN: Probably not, but that’s OK.
PROFESSOR: Well, I’m sure a lot of positive things will come out of your design.
PROFESSOR: Now, you seem to have thought about everything so what exactly did you need me to help you with?
JOHN: Well, my design has made it to the final stage of the competition and, in a few months’ time, I have to give a
presentation
(Q26)
, and that’s the part I was hoping you could help me with.
PROFESSOR: Right, well that should be easy enough.
What have you managed to do so far?
JOHN: Well, I’ve got detailed drawings to show how it will work and I’ve also written a 500-word paper on it.
PROFESSOR: I see. Well, if you want to stand a good chance of winning you really need a
model (Q27)
of the machine.
JOHN: Yes, I thought I might but I’m having a few problems.
PROFESSOR: What is the main difficulty so far?
Let me guess—is it the
materials (Q28)
?
JOHN: Yes, I want it to look professional but everything that’s top quality is also very expensive.
PROFESSOR: Look, projects like this are very important to us.
They really help lift our profile.
So why don’t you talk to the university about a
grant (Q29)
?
I can help you fill out the application forms if you like.
JOHN: That would be great.
PROFESSOR: You’d better show me this paper you’ve written as well.
For a global competition such as this you need to make sure the
technical
(Q30)
details you’ve given are accurate and thorough.
JOHN: That would be a great help.
PROFESSOR: Is there anything else I can do?
JOHN: Well, I’m really…
