原文
TRAVEL AGENT
: Good morning.World Tours.
My name is Jamie. How can I help you?
ANDREA
: Good morning. I want some information on self-drive tours in the USA.
Could you send me a brochure?
TRAVEL AGENT
: Of course. Could I have your name please?
ANDREA
: Andrea Brown.
TRAVEL AGENT
: Thank you. And your address?
ANDREA
: 24,
Ardleigh (Q1)
Road.
TRAVEL AGENT
: Can you spell that?
ANDREA
: A-R-D-L-E-l-G-H Road.
TRAVEL AGENT
: Postcode?
ANDREA
: BH5 2OP.
TRAVEL AGENT
: Thanks. And can I have your phone number?
ANDREA
: Is a mobile alright?
TRAVEL AGENT
: Fine.
ANDREA
: It’s 07786643091.
TRAVEL AGENT
: Thank you. And can I ask you where you heard about World Tours?
From a friend? Or did you see an advert somewhere?
ANDREA
: No, I read about you in the
newspaper (Q2)
.
TRAVEL AGENT
: OK, I’ll get the brochures in the post to you but can I give you some information over the phone.
What kinds of things do you want to do on your holiday?
ANDREA
: I’m interested in going to California with my family.
I’ve got two children and we want to hire a car.
TRAVEL AGENT
: OK.
We have a couple of self-drive tours there visiting different places of interest in California.
The first one begins in Los Angeles and there’s plenty of time to visit some of the
theme
(Q3)
parks there.
ANDREA
: That’s something on my children’s list so I’d want to include that.
TRAVEL AGENT
: Good.
Then you drive to San Francisco.
From San Francisco you can drive to Yosemite Park where you spend a couple of nights.
You can choose to stay in a lodge or on the
campsite
.
ANDREA
: I don’t like the idea of staying in a
tent (Q4)
.
It’d be too hot.
TRAVEL AGENT
: Right. And the tour ends in Las Vegas.
ANDREA
: OK.
TRAVEL AGENT
: The other trip we can arrange is slightly different.
It starts in San Francisco.
Then you drive south to Cambria.
ANDREA
: Someone told me there’s a really nice
castle (Q5)
near Cambria.
Will we go near that?
TRAVEL AGENT
: Hearst Castle is on that road so you could stop there.
ANDREA
: Good. I’d like to do that.
Does this trip also go into the desert?
TRAVEL AGENT
: No, it continues to Santa Monica where most people like to stop and do some shopping.
ANDREA
: We have enough of that at home so that doesn’t interest us.
TRAVEL AGENT
: OK. Well, you could go straight on to San Diego.
ANDREA
: That’s good for
beaches (Q6)
isn’t it?
TRAVEL AGENT
: That’s right, that’s a good place to relax and your children might like to visit the zoo before flying home.
ANDREA
: I don’t think so.
We want some time for sunbathing and swimming.
ANDREA
: So how many days are the trips and how much do they cost?
TRAVEL AGENT
: The first one I told you about is a self-drive tour through California which lasts twelve days and covers
2020 (Q7)
kilometres.
The shortest journey is 206 km and the longest is 632 kilometres.
The cost is £525 per person.
That includes
accommodation
, car rental and a
flight (Q8)
but no meals.
ANDREA
: OK. And the other trip?
TRAVEL AGENT
: That lasts nine days but you spend only three days on the road.
You cover about 980 kilometres
altogether
.
ANDREA
: So is that cheaper then?
TRAVEL AGENT
: Yes, it’s almost a hundred pounds cheaper.
It’s £
429 (Q9)
per person, which is a good deal.
ANDREA
: So that covers
accommodation
and car hire.
What about flights?
TRAVEL AGENT
: They aren’t included.
But these hotels offer
dinner (Q10)
in the price.
ANDREA
: OK. Well, thank you very much.
I’ll be in touch when I’ve had a chance to look at the brochure.
TRAVEL AGENT
: I’m pleased to help. Goodbye.
ANDREA
: Bye.
