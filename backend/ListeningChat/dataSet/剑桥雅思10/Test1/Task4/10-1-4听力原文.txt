原文
Today we continue our series on ecology and conservation with a look at a particularly endangered member of the black bear family.
One in ten black bears is actually born with a white coat, which is the result of a special
gene (Q1)
that surfaces in a few.
Local people have named it ‘the spirit bear’.
And according to the legends of these communities, its snowy
fur
brings with it a special
power (Q2)
.
Because of this, it has always been highly regarded by them—so much that they do not speak of seeing it to anyone else.
It is their way of protecting it when
strangers (Q3)
visit the area.
The white bear’s habitat is quite interesting.
The bear’s strong relationship with the old-growth rainforest is a complex one.
The while bear relies on the huge centuries-old trees in the forest in many ways.
For example, the old-growth trees have extremely long roots that help prevent
erosion
(Q4)
of the soil along the banks of the many fish streams.
Keeping these banks
intact
is important because these streams are home to
salmon
, which are the bear’s main food source.
In return, the bear s feeding habits
nurture
the forest.
As the bears eat the
salmon
, they
discard
the skin and bones in great amounts on the forest floor, which provide vital nutrients.
These produce
lush
vegetation
that sustains thousands of other types of life forms, from birds to insects and more.
Today, the spirit bear lives off the coast of the province of British Columbia on a few
islands (Q5)
.
There is great concern for their survival since it is estimated that less than two hundred of these white bears remain.
The best way to protect them is to make every effort to
preserve
the delicate balance of their forest environment—in other words, their
ecosystem
.
The greatest threat to the bear’s existence is the loss of its habitat.
Over many years, logging companies have stripped the land by cutting down a large number of trees.
In addition, they have built
roads (Q6)
which have fractured the areas where the bear usually feeds, and many
hibernation
sites have also been lost.
The logging of the trees along the streams has damaged the places where the bears fish.
To make matters worse, the number of
salmon
in those streams is declining because there is no legal limit on
fishing (Q7)
at the moment.
All these influences have a negative impact on the spirit bear’s very existence, which is made all the more
fragile
by the fact that
reproduction
(Q8)
among these bears has always been disappointingly low.
And so, what’s the situation going forward?
Community organizations, environmental groups and the British Columbia government are now working together on the problem.
The government is now requiring logging companies to adopt a better logging
method (Q9)
, which is a positive step.
However, these measures alone may not be
sufficient
to ensure a healthy population of the spirit bear in the future.
Other steps also need to be taken.
While it is important to maintain the spirit bear’s habitat, there also needs to be more emphasis on its
expansion (Q10)
.
The move is justified as it will also create space for other bears that are losing their homes.
