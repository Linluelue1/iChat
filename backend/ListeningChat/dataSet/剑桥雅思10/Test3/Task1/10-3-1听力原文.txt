原文
DIRECTOR
: Good morning.
Welcome to the Early Learning Childcare Centre.
How may I help you?
CAROL
: Hi.
I spoke to you last week about enrolling my daughter for next year.
DIRECTOR
: Oh, yes.
I’ll just get some details from you.
So, you’re her mother?
CAROL
: That’s right.
DIRECTOR
: And, can I have your name?
CAROL
: It’s Carol, Carol Smith.
DIRECTOR
: And your daughter’s name?
CAROL
: It’s Kate.
DIRECTOR
: Now, we have several groups at the centre and we
cater
for children from three to five years old.
How old is your daughter?
CAROL
: She’s three now but she turns four next month.
DIRECTOR
: I’ll put
four (Q1)
down because that’s how old she’ll be when she starts.
CAROL
: Fine, she’s so excited about her birthday and coming to the centre.
DIRECTOR
: That’s good to hear.
And what’s your address?
CAROL
: It’s
46 Wombat Road (Q2)
, that’s W-O-M-B-A-T.
Woodside 4032.
DIRECTOR
: And what’s the phone number?
CAROL
: Oh …
it’s … 3345 9865.
DIRECTOR
: So, have you decided on the days you’d like to bring your daughter here?
CAROL
: I’d prefer Monday and Wednesday if possible.
DIRECTOR
: Mmm.
I’ll check.
Monday’s fine, but I think the centre is already full for Wednesday.
Erm.
Yes.
Sorry.
It seems to be a very popular day.
We can offer you a Thursday or a Friday as well.
CAROL
: Oh dear.
I suppose
Thursday (Q3)
would be all right because she has swimming on Friday.
DIRECTOR
: OK, got that.
Because a lot of parents work, we do offer
flexible
start and finish times.
We are open from 7:30 in the morning until 6 o’clock at night.
What time would you like your daughter to start?
CAROL
: I need to get to work in the city by 9:00 so I’ll drop her off at
8:30 (Q4)
.
You’re pretty dose to the city here so that should give me plenty of time to get there.
DIRECTOR
: That’s fine.
Now, we also need to decide which group she’ll be in.
We have two different groups and they’re divided up according to age.
There’s the green group, which is for three- to four-year-olds.
And then there’s the
red (Q5)
group which is for four- to five-year-olds.
CAROL
: She’s quite mature for her age and she can already write her name and read a little.
DIRECTOR
: Well.
I’ll put her in the red group and we can always change her to the green one if there are any problems.
CAROL
: That sounds fine.
DIRECTOR
: OK.
Let’s move on to meals.
We can provide breakfast, lunch and dinner.
As she’s finishing pretty early, she won’t need dinner, will you give her breakfast before she comes?
CAROL
: Yes, she’ll only need
lunch (Q6)
.
DIRECTOR
: Now, does she have any medical conditions we need to know about?
Does she have
asthma
or any hearing problems for example?
CAROL
: No.
But she does need to wear
glasses (Q7)
.
DIRECTOR
: Oh, I’ll make a note of that.
CAROL
: Yes, she’s pretty good about wearing them, she can’t see much without them.
DIRECTOR
: Right.
OK.
Now, I also need
emergency
contact details.
CAROL
: So what sort of information do you need?
DIRECTOR
: Just the name and number of a friend or family member we can contact in case we can’t get hold of you at any time.
CAROL
: OK.
That’d better be my sister…
Jenny Ball.
That’s
B-A-double L (Q8)
.
Her phone number is 3346 7523.
DIRECTOR
: Great.
So she is the child’s
aunt (Q9)
?
CAROL
: Yes, that’s right.
DIRECTOR
: I’ll make a note of that as well.
Now, is there anything you’d like to ask?
CAROL
: What about payment?
How much are the fees each term?
DIRECTOR
: Well, for two days and the hours you’ve chosen, that will be $450
altogether
.
CAROL
: OK, and do I have to pay that now?
DIRECTOR
: No, we send out invoices once the children start at the centre.
You can choose to pay at the end of each term or we do offer a slightly discounted rate if you pay
every month (Q10)
.
CAROL
: Oh.
I’ll do that then.
I find it easier to
budget
that way and I’m not used to the term dates just yet.
DIRECTOR
: Good, it makes it a lot simpler for us as well.
Well, that’s everything.
Would you like me to show you around…?
