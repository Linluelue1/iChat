原文
MR THORNDYKE
: Thorndyke’s.
EDITH
: Good morning.
Is that Mr Thorndyke?
MR THORNDYKE
: Speaking.
How can I help?
EDITH
: I’ve got quite a few things which need painting and fixing in the flat and I wonder whether you’d be able to do the work.
MR THORNDYKE
: I’m sure I’d be able to help but let me take down a few details.
EDITH
: Yes, of course.
MR THORNDYKE
: Well, firstly, how did you hear about us?
EDITH
: It was my friend May Hampton…
you did some excellent work for her a couple of years ago. D
o you remember?
MR THORNDYKE
: Oh, yes, that was in West Park Flats, lovely lady.
EDITH
: Yes, she is.
MR THORNDYKE
: And what’s your name, please?
EDITH
: It’s Edith
Pargetter (Q1)
.
MR THORNDYKE
: Edith …
can you spell your surname, please?
EDITH
: It’s P-A-R-G-E-double T-E-R.
MR THORNDYKE
: Double T, right.
And do you live in West Park Flats as well?
EDITH
: No, actually it’s
East (Q2)
Park. Flat 4.
MR THORNDYKE
: Oh, right, that’s over the road, I seem to remember—quite difficult to get to.
EDITH
: Yes, it’s at the back of the
library (Q3)
.
MR THORNDYKE
: Right, I know.
And what’s your phone number?
EDITH
: 875934 but I’m out a great deal in the afternoons and evenings.
MR THORNDYKE
: So would the best time to ring you be in the
morning (Q4)
?
EDITH
: Yes.
MR THORNDYKE
: Fine.
I’ve made a note of that.
Can I just ask, I’ll be in a van and I know parking’s rather difficult round your flats.
Where would you recommend?
EDITH
: Well, I always tell people in larger vehicles to park by the
postbox (Q5)
on the other side of the road from the entrance.
MR THORNDYKE
: Good, thanks.
EDITH:
And will you be able to give me a full itemised quote?
MR THORNDYKE
: Oh, yes, I’ll list all the jobs separately with individual
prices (Q6)
.
EDITH
: That’d be a great help.
MR THORNDYKE
: No problem.
MR THORNDYKE
: Now, what would you like me to do?
EDITH
: Firstly and most urgently is in the kitchen.
With all the weather damage, the
glass (Q7)
in the door has cracked and I’d need that fixing…
MR THORNDYKE
: I presume you mean replacing?
EDITH
: Oh, yes.
And as soon as possible…
MR THORNDYKE
: What I’ll do is come round tomorrow morning and do that immediately.
EDITH
: Thank you so much.
The other things aren’t so urgent but…
MR THORNDYKE
: Now, I’ll make a note of everything you want doing.
EDITH
: Well, in the kitchen I’d like some painting doing.
MR THORNDYKE
: All the kitchen walls?
EDITH
: Just the area over the
cooker (Q8)
.
It’s very greasy…
MR THORNDYKE
: Right…
it does tend to get that way!
EDITH
: Yes!
MR THORNDYKE
: Well, if you want a proper job done what I’d need to do is
strip
the old paint and
plaster
it about a
week (Q9)
before I paint it.
EDITH
: Of course.
Now, May tells me you also do work in the garden.
MR THORNDYKE
: That’s right.
EDITH
: Well, I’d like you to replace a
fence (Q10)
.
MR THORNDYKE
: Just one?
EDITH:
Yes, at the far end.
MR THORNDYKE
: Fine.
Shouldn’t be a problem.
EDITH
: And that’s the lot.
MR THORNDYKE
: Fine.
Yeah, as I say I can come round tomorrow morning to look over things with you.
EDITH
: That’s great, thank you.
MR THORNDYKE
: So, I’ll look forward to seeing you tomorrow at…
