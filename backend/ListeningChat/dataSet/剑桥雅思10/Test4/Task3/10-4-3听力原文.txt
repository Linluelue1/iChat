原文
TIM
: Hi, Laura—could you spare a few minutes to talk about the work placement you did last summer?
I’m thinking of doing one myself…
LAURA
: Hi, Tim.
Sure.
TIM
: Didn’t you do yours at an environmental services company?
LAURA
: That’s right…
It’s only a very small company and they needed someone to produce a company brochure, and I wanted to get some business experience because I’m interested in a career in occupational
psychology
in a business environment.
It was good because I had overall responsibility for the project.
TIM
: What kind of skills do you think you developed on the placement?
I mean, apart from the ones you already had..
Did you have to do all the artwork for the brochure, the layout and everything?
LAURA
: We hired the services of a professional photographer for that.
I did have to use my IT skills to a certain extent because I cut and pasted text from marketing leaflets, but that didn’t involve anything I hadn’t done before.
TIM
:
Do you think you got any better at managing your time and prioritising things (Q21)
?
You always used to say you had trouble with that…
LAURA
: Oh, definitely.
There was so much pressure to meet the project deadline.
And I also got better at explaining things and asserting my opinions (Q22)
, because I had to have weekly consultations with the marketing manager and give him a progress report.
TIM
: It sounds as if you got a lot out of it then.
LAURA
: Absolutely.
It was really worthwhile …
But you know, the company benefited too…
TIM
: Yes, they must have done.
After all, if they’d used a professional advertising agency to produce their brochure instead of doing it in-house,
presumably
they’d have paid a lot more?
LAURA
: Oh, yes.
I worked it out—-
it would have been 250 per cent more (Q23)
.
And I thought the end result was good, even though we did everything on site.
The company has quite a powerful computer and I managed to borrow some scanning software from the university.
The new brochure looks really professional;
–
it enhances the image of the company straight away (Q24)
.
TIM
: So in the long run it should help them to attract clients, and improve their sales figures?
LAURA
: That’s the idea.
Yeah.
TIM
: Well, all in all it sounds very positive — I think I will go ahead and apply for a placement myself.
How do I go about it?
LAURA
: It’s easy enough to do, because there’s a government agency called STEP- S-T-E-P – that organises placements for students.
You should start by getting their
booklet
with all the details—I expect you can download one from their website.
TIM
: Actually,
they’ve got copies in the
psychology
department (Q25)
—I’ve seen them there, I’ll just go to the office and pick one up.
LAURA
: Right.
And then if I were you, after I’d looked at it I’d go over all the options with someone…
TIM
: I suppose I should ask my tutor’s advice.
He knows more about me than anyone.
LAURA
:
One of the career officers would be better (Q26)
, they’ve got more knowledge about the jobs market than your personal tutor would have.
TIM
: OK…
LAURA
: And then when you know what you want you can register with STEP—you’ll find their address in the
booklet
.
And once you’ve
registered
they assign you to a
mentor
who looks after your application.
TIM
: And then I suppose you just sit back and wait till you hear something?
LAURA
: They told me at the careers office that it’s best to be
proactive
, and
get updates yourself by checking the website for new placement alerts (Q27)
.
Your
mentor
is supposed to keep you informed, but you can’t rely on that.
TIM
: I don’t suppose it’s a good idea to get in touch with companies directly, is it?
LAURA
: Not really…
But it is the company who notifies you if they want you to go for an interview.
You get a letter of invitation or an email from personnel departments (Q28)
.
TIM
: And do I reply directly to them?
LAURA
: Yes, you do.
STEP only gets involved again once you’ve been made a job offer.
TIM
: Right…
So, once you’ve had an interview you should let your
mentor
know what the outcome is (Q29)
?
I mean whether you’re offered a job, and whether you’ve decided to accept it?
LAURA
: That’s right.
They’ll inform the careers office once a placement has been agreed, so you don’t have to do that.
TIM
: Is that all then?
LAURA
: More or less.
Only once you’ve accepted an offer you’ll probably have to supply a reference, because the placement will be conditional on that.
And
that’s something you should ask your own tutor to provide (Q30)
.
He knows about your academic ability and also about your qualities, like reliability.
TIM
: Well, thanks very much for the information—I’m starting to look forward…
