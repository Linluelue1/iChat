原文
Today we’re going to look at an important area of science, namely
nanotechnology
.
So what is it?
Nano means tiny, so it’s science and engineering on the scale of atoms and molecules.
The idea is that by controlling and rearranging atoms, you can literally create anything.
However, as we’ll see, the science of the small has some big implications affecting us in many ways.
There’s no doubt that
nanotechnology
promises so much for civilisation.
However, all new technologies have their teething problems.
And with
nanotechnology
, society often gets the wrong idea about its capabilities (Q31)
.
Numerous science-fiction books and movies have raised people’s fears about
nanotechnology
– with scenarios such as inserting little nano-robots into your body that monitor everything you do without you realising it, or self-replicating nano-robots that
eventually
take over the world.
So how do we
safeguard
such a potentially powerful technology?
Some scientists recommend that nano-particles be treated as new chemicals with separate safety tests and dear labelling (Q32)
.
They believe that greater care should also be taken with nano-particles in laboratories and factories.
Others have called for a
withdrawal
of new nano products such as cosmetics and a temporary
halt
to many kinds of nanotech research.
But as far as I’m concerned there’s a need to
plough
ahead with the discoveries and applications of
nanotechnology (Q33)
.
I really believe that most scientists would welcome a way to guard against
unethical
uses of such technology.
We can’t go around thinking that all
innovation
is bad, all advancement is bad.
As with the debate about any new technology, it is how you use it that’s important.
So let’s look at some of its possible uses.
Thanks to
nanotechnology
, there could be a major
breakthrough
in the field of transportation with the production of more
durable
metals (Q34)
.
These could be
virtually
unbreakable, lighter and much more
pliable
leading to planes that are 50 times lighter than at present.
Those same improved capabilities will
dramatically
reduce the cost of travelling into
space (Q35)
making it more
accessible
to ordinary people and opening up a totally new holiday destination.
In terms of technology, the computer industry will be able to
shrink
computer parts down to minute sizes.
We need
nanotechnology
in order to create a new generation of computers that will work even faster and will have a million times more
memory (Q36)
but will be about the size of a sugar cube.
Nanotechnology
could also
revolutionise
the way that we
generate
power.
The cost of
solar (Q37)
cells will be
drastically
reduced so harnessing this energy will be far more economical than at present.
But
nanotechnology
has much wider applications than this and could have an enormous impact on our environment.
For
instance
, tiny
airborne
nano-robots could be programmed to actually rebuild the
ozone
layer, which could lessen the impact of global warming on our planet.
That’s a pretty amazing thought, isn’t it?
On a more local scale, this new technology could help with the clean-up of environmental disasters as
nanotechnology
will allow us to remove
oil (Q38)
and other contaminants from the water far more effectively.
And, if
nanotechnology
progresses as expected —as a sort of building block set of about 90 atoms—then you could build anything you wanted from the bottom up.
In terms of production, this means that you only use what you need and so there wouldn’t be any
waste (Q39)
.
The
notion
that you could create anything at all has major implications for our health.
It means that we’ll
eventually
be able to replicate anything.
This would have a
phenomenal
effect on our society.
In time it could even lead to the
eradication
of
famine
through the introduction of machines that produce food to feed the hungry.
But it’s in the area of medicine that
nanotechnology
may have its biggest impact.
How we
detect
disease will change as  tiny
biosensors
are developed to analyse
tests (Q40)
in minutes rather than days.
There’s even
speculation
nano-robots could be used to slow the ageing process, lengthening life expectancy.
As you can see, I’m very excited by the implications that could be available to us in the next few decades.
Just how long it’ll take, I honestly don’t know.
